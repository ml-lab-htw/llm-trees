This function directly implements the decision tree logic I outlined previously, using the specified feature names and thresholds.  Remember, this is a hypothetical example, and a real-world application would involve training on data and likely a more sophisticated tree structure.  Also, the thresholds I've used are examples and may not be clinically accurate.  Always consult with medical professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment.
