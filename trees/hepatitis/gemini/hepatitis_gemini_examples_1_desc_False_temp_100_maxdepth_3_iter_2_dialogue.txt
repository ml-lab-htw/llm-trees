```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.0
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives (low bilirubin, normal prothrombin time)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies (low bilirubin, high prothrombin time)
    else:  # High Bilirubin
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Dies (high bilirubin, low albumin)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies (high bilirubin, normal or high albumin)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've used reasonable thresholds based on general medical knowledge for liver disease. However, optimal thresholds would come from analyzing real patient data.
* **Depth 3:** The tree respects the maximum depth of 3.
* **Feature Selection:** I've used "BILIRUBIN", "PROTIME", and "ALBUMIN" as features based on the previous example and their known clinical significance in liver disease. Again, the best features would be determined by data analysis.
* **Truth Values List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of each decision node's condition, allowing you to trace the path through the tree.
* **Target Encoding:** The function outputs 1 for "survives" and 0 for "dies," consistent with your specified encoding.

**Important:**  Remember, this is a *demonstration* using placeholder thresholds and feature selection.  A real-world decision tree would require training on a dataset to achieve accurate predictions.
