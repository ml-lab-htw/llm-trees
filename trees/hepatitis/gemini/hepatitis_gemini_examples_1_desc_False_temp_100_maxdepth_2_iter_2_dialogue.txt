def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # Threshold for bilirubin (normal is around 1.2)
    nodes[1] = X["AGE"] <= 50         # Hypothetical threshold for age (you can replace this with actual data)
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0    # Threshold for prothrombin time (normal is around 11-14 seconds)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function uses the same decision tree logic as described previously, but now formatted as a Python function and using the specified feature names.  It returns both the prediction (0 for dies, 1 for survives) and a list `nodes` indicating which branches of the tree were taken.  

For example:

* If `PROTIME` is 11 and `BILIRUBIN` is 1.5, `nodes` will be `[0, None]` (because the second condition isn't evaluated).
* If `PROTIME` is 15 and `BILIRUBIN` is 3.0, `nodes` will be `[1, 1]`.
* If `PROTIME` is 15 and `BILIRUBIN` is 1.5, `nodes` will be `[1, 0]`.


Remember that the thresholds (12 for PROTIME and 2.0 for BILIRUBIN) are just examples and would need to be determined from real data in a true machine learning application.  The same applies to the choice of features used for splitting.
