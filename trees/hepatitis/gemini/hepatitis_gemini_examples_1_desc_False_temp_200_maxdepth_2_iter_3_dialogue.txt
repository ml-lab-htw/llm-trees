**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Keys:** The code now correctly uses the provided feature keys (e.g., "BILIRUBIN", "PROTIME") with correct capitalization.
2. **Thresholds:** I've included example thresholds (2.0 for bilirubin and 15.0 for prothrombin time).  These are just examples, and in a real-world scenario, these values should be determined from training data.
3. **Node List:** The `nodes` list is populated with the truth values of the conditions at each inner node (1 if true, 0 if false). This provides a record of the decision path taken for a given input.
4. **Comments:**  The code includes comments to explain the logic and the chosen thresholds.
5. **Type Hinting:** The function signature now includes type hinting (`X: dict`) to improve readability and maintainability.


**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'AGE': 50,
    'SEX': 2,
    'STEROID': 1,
    # ... other features ...
    'BILIRUBIN': 1.5,
    'PROTIME': 12,
    'HISTOLOGY': 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (survives)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")         # Output: Nodes: [True, True] 
```


This improved version provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree, while highlighting the importance of using real data to train the model and determine optimal thresholds. Remember to consult with medical experts for feature selection and interpretation of the results.
