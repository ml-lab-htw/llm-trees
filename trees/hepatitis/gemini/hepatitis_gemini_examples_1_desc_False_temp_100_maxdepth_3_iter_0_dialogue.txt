**Explanation of the chosen thresholds and features:**

* **BILIRUBIN > 2.0 mg/dL:**  Elevated bilirubin levels are often associated with liver disease severity.  A value above 2.0 is a common threshold for indicating potential problems.
* **PROTIME > 12.0 seconds:** Prothrombin time measures how long it takes for blood to clot. A prolonged prothrombin time (greater than 12 seconds) can suggest liver damage or other clotting disorders, which can be life-threatening in hepatitis patients.
* **ALBUMIN < 3.5 g/dL:** Albumin is a protein made by the liver. Low albumin levels can indicate chronic liver disease and malnutrition. A value below 3.5 g/dL is generally considered low.

These thresholds are illustrative and based on general medical knowledge. In a real-world scenario, the optimal thresholds would be determined through data analysis and model training.  The choice of these features and thresholds tries to mimic clinical reasoning about liver function and its impact on survival.  A real model trained on data might identify entirely different features or thresholds as being most important.
