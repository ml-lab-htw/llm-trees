```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # Using Bilirubin as a primary split
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15.0   # Using Prothrombin Time as a secondary split

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Likely to live if Bilirubin is low
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely to live if Prothrombin Time is also low
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely to die if both are high

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Rationale:**

1. **Feature Selection:** Based on medical knowledge and the hypothetical example in the previous response, I've chosen "BILIRUBIN" and "PROTIME" as the two most important features for this illustrative tree. High bilirubin and prolonged prothrombin time are often associated with liver dysfunction, which can be a significant factor in mortality.

2. **Thresholds:**  I've used threshold values of 2.0 mg/dL for bilirubin and 15 seconds for prothrombin time.  These are *example* values and would need to be adjusted based on actual data analysis and medical expertise.  In a real-world application, you'd determine optimal thresholds using techniques like grid search or cross-validation on a training dataset.

3. **Tree Logic:** The function implements the decision tree logic as described in the previous response:
   - If bilirubin is low (<= 2.0), the prediction is survival (1).
   - If bilirubin is high (> 2.0), the prothrombin time is checked:
     - If prothrombin time is low (<= 15.0), the prediction is survival (1).
     - If prothrombin time is high (> 15.0), the prediction is death (0).

4. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each inner node. This allows you to trace the path taken by the decision tree for a given input.

**How to improve the tree:**

* **Real Data:**  The most important improvement would be to use a real dataset to train the decision tree.  This would allow for data-driven feature selection and threshold optimization.
* **Feature Engineering:** Explore potential interactions between features (e.g., combining bilirubin and albumin) or creating Features based on domain knowledge.
* **Deeper Trees (if appropriate):** If the data supports it, consider increasing the maximum depth of the tree to capture more complex relationships.  However, be mindful of overfitting.
* **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the tree and prevent overfitting.
* **Other Algorithms:** Consider other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) which often outperform single decision trees.


This improved example provides a more functional and realistic approach to building a decision tree, while still adhering to the requested format and constraints.  Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values derived from data analysis when you have a real dataset.
