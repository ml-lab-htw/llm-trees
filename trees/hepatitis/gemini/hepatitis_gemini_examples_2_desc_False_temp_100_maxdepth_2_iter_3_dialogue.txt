**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:**  I've chosen "BILIRUBIN" and "ALBUMIN" as the key features for this decision tree. These are common indicators of liver function, and liver health is crucial for survival in patients with potential liver-related issues.

2. **Thresholds:** 
   -  `BILIRUBIN <= 1.5`: A bilirubin level above 1.5 mg/dL is often considered a sign of potential liver problems.
   -  `ALBUMIN <= 3.0`:  Low albumin levels (below 3.0 g/dL) can indicate liver dysfunction.

3. **Tree Logic:** The tree prioritizes bilirubin as the first decision point.  High bilirubin suggests a higher risk, regardless of albumin.  If bilirubin is low, then albumin levels are considered for further risk assessment.

**Important Notes:**

* **Simplified Example:** This is a simplified decision tree for demonstration. In a real medical scenario, you'd need a more complex model with more features and data for accurate predictions. 
* **Data Required:**  To build a more robust tree, you'd need a labeled dataset with patient information and their survival outcomes.
* **Ethical Considerations:**  Never use such a simplified model for actual medical decision-making.  Always consult with healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment.
