def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.5  # Threshold for elevated bilirubin
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.5   # Threshold for low albumin
    nodes[2] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15    # Threshold for prolonged prothrombin time 

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # High risk: High bilirubin, low albumin
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lower risk: High bilirubin, but normal albumin
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Higher risk: Normal bilirubin, but prolonged PT
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lower risk: Normal bilirubin and PT

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

* **Function:** `predict(X)` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys are the feature names and values are the patient's data.
* **Nodes List:** `nodes` stores the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node in the tree. A value of 1 means the condition is true, and 0 means false.
* **Decision Nodes (Depth 1 & 2):**
    * `nodes[0]`: Checks if bilirubin is less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.
    * `nodes[1]`:  If bilirubin is elevated, checks if albumin is less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL.
    * `nodes[2]`: If bilirubin is normal, checks if prothrombin time is prolonged (greater than 15 seconds).
* **Prediction:** The `prediction` is made based on traversing the tree according to the truth values in `nodes`.
* **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds (1.5 mg/dL for bilirubin, 3.5 g/dL for albumin, 15 seconds for prothrombin time) are examples. In a real-world scenario, these thresholds should be determined through data analysis and medical expertise.

**Important:** This function is still a simplification.  Accurate prediction of patient survival requires a more complex model and should only be done by qualified medical professionals.
