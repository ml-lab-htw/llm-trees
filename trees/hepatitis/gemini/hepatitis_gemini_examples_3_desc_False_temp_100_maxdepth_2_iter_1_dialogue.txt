**Explanation:**

This function implements a decision tree of depth 2 with the following logic:

1. **Node 0 (Root):**  Checks if "BILIRUBIN" is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (a common threshold for elevated bilirubin).
2. **Node 1 (Left):**
    - If Bilirubin is low (Node 0 is True), it checks for the presence of "ASCITES" (fluid in the abdomen).
    - If Bilirubin is high (Node 0 is False), it checks if "PROTIME" (prothrombin time) is less than or equal to 15.0 seconds (indicating potential clotting issues). 
3. **Node 2 (Right):** Checks if "ALBUMIN" level is less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL (a sign of liver dysfunction).

The prediction is made by traversing the tree based on the feature values in the input dictionary `X`. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (2.0 for Bilirubin, 15.0 for Prothrombin Time, 3.5 for Albumin) are examples. You should consult medical literature or experts to determine the most appropriate thresholds for this specific dataset and prediction task.
* **Feature Importance:** The tree assumes "BILIRUBIN" is the most important feature, followed by "ASCITES" (if bilirubin is low) or "PROTIME" (if bilirubin is high), and finally "ALBUMIN". This order should be based on feature importance determined during the tree induction process (e.g., using information gain or Gini impurity).
* **Data Required:** To create a more accurate and robust decision tree, you'll need a labeled dataset with patient information (features) and their corresponding survival outcomes. 

This code provides a framework. Remember to adapt thresholds, feature choices, and tree structure based on your specific dataset and analysis.
