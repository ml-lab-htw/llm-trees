**Explanation and Refinements:**

* **Threshold Values:** I've filled in reasonable threshold values for the medical features based on general medical knowledge.  These values are for illustrative purposes only and would need to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The function assumes the encoding specified in your prompt (e.g., 0/1 for yes/no, numerical values for bilirubin, albumin, protime, and age).
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which are implicitly converted to 1/0) of each decision node, following your specified format. It now correctly returns only the used nodes (up to index 5).
* **Simplified Logic:** The decision logic closely mirrors the tree structure described earlier, with appropriate adjustments for the specified feature encoding.


**Important:**  This code is still a *simplified example* for demonstration. A real-world prediction model would require training on a substantial dataset of patient information and outcomes to determine accurate thresholds and feature importance.  Always consult with medical professionals for actual medical decision-making.
