**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Names:**  Uses the correct uppercase feature names from the provided list (e.g., "ASCITES," "PROTIME").
2. **Thresholds:** Includes reasonable threshold values for "PROTIME," "BILIRUBIN," and "ALBUMIN," reflecting the medical context.  These values would ideally be learned from data in a real application.
3. **Truth Value List (nodes):** The `nodes` list stores the boolean (True/False) results of each decision in the tree. These are converted to 1/0 for the final output.
4. **Conditional Logic:** Improved the conditional logic to match the decision tree structure precisely and handle the nested conditions more clearly.
5. **Handling Missing Values (None):** The code handles potential `None` values in `nodes` where the condition wasn't evaluated. This occurs in branches that are not taken due to earlier decisions. These `None` values are converted to 0 for consistency in the returned `nodes` list.


This improved function now provides a more accurate representation of the decision tree logic and returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes as required. Remember, this is still a simplified example, and a real-world model would require training on data to determine the optimal thresholds and tree structure.
