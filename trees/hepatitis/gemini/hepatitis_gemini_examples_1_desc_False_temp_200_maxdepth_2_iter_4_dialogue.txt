```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** I've used 2.0 mg/dL for bilirubin and 15 seconds for prothrombin time as reasonable thresholds based on medical context.  Remember these would ideally be learned from training data.
* **Direct Survival Prediction:** The code now directly predicts 0 (dies) or 1 (survives) based on the decision tree logic, making the code more readable.
* **Simplified Structure:** The nested `if/else` structure is slightly streamlined to directly reflect the decision tree's branches.

**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'AGE': 50,
    'SEX': 2,
    'STEROID': 1,
    # ... other features
    'BILIRUBIN': 1.5,
    'PROTIME': 12,
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (survives)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


patient_data2 = {
    'AGE': 60,
    'SEX': 1,
    'STEROID': 0,
    # ... other features
    'BILIRUBIN': 3.5,
    'PROTIME': 18,
    # ... other features
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(patient_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (dies)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```


This improved function adheres to the specified format, provides meaningful threshold values, and is more readable and understandable. Remember that the chosen thresholds are illustrative and should be determined from real data using a decision tree training algorithm.  A more complex model would likely be necessary for accurate predictions in a real-world medical setting.
