```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # Using Bilirubin as the key feature

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives if Bilirubin is less than or equal to 2.0
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Dies if Bilirubin is greater than 2.0

    return prediction, nodes

```


This function uses the `BILIRUBIN` level as the deciding factor, with a threshold of 2.0 mg/dL. The `nodes` list contains the truth value of the single decision node.  Remember that this is a highly simplified model and its effectiveness would be very limited in a real-world scenario without proper training on a dataset.  A real-world application would require a more sophisticated model derived from data analysis.
