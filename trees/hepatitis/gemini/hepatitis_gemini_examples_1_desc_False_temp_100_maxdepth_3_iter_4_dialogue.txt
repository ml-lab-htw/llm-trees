**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  More realistic threshold values are used based on medical considerations.
* **Specific Feature Names:** The code now uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Truth Value List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which can be treated as 1/0) of the decision nodes, as requested.
* **Consistent Encoding:** Uses the provided encoding for the target variable (0 = die, 1 = live).
* **Improved Logic:**  The decision logic is refined to better reflect the assumed importance of the features.



This function directly implements the decision tree logic without any training, as per the prompt's instructions.  Remember that this is still a *hypothetical* tree and its accuracy on real data is unknown. Using this function on actual patient data requires careful consideration and should not be used for actual medical decision-making without proper validation and consultation with medical professionals.  It is crucial to train a decision tree on a real dataset to obtain reliable predictions.
