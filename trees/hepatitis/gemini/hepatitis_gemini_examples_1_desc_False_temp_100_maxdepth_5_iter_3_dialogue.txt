    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.5   # Albumin below 3.5 often indicates poor liver function
    nodes[2] = X["PROTIME"] >= 12.0  # Prothrombin time above normal range suggests liver issues

    nodes[4] = X["ASCITES"] == 1 #Ascites is a strong indicator

    truth_values = [1 if node else 0 for node in nodes]

                    prediction = 1 # Lives - Better liver function markers

Key Improvements:

* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've added realistic threshold values based on medical knowledge related to liver disease for the continuous variables (BILIRUBIN, ALBUMIN, PROTIME, ALK PHOSPHATE). These are crucial for making the decision tree practical.  *Adjust these thresholds if you have specific domain expertise or if your data suggests different cutoff points.*
* **Handles Categorical and Numerical Features:** The code correctly handles both binary (0/1) encoded categorical features and numerical features.
* **Clear Logic:** The decision tree logic is implemented using nested `if` statements, clearly representing the branching structure.
* **Returns Truth Values:** The function now returns the `truth_values` list as requested, indicating which conditions were met at each node.
* **Feature Names:**  Uses the correct uppercase feature names provided.
* **Target Encoding:** Uses 0 for "die" and 1 for "live" as specified.


**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'AGE': 55, 'SEX': 2, 'STEROID': 1, 'ANTIVIRALS': 0, 'FATIGUE': 1, 'MALAISE': 1, 'ANOREXIA': 1,
    'LIVER BIG': 1, 'LIVER FIRM': 1, 'SPLEEN PALPABLE': 1, 'SPIDERS': 1, 'ASCITES': 1, 'VARICES': 1,
    'BILIRUBIN': 2.5, 'ALK PHOSPHATE': 150, 'SGOT': 120, 'ALBUMIN': 2.8, 'PROTIME': 14, 'HISTOLOGY': 1
}

prediction, truth_values = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: 0 (dies) if all conditions are met
print(f"Truth Values: {truth_values}") # Example [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] - will vary depending on inputs
```

Remember to adapt the thresholds and tree structure further based on analysis of your specific dataset and expert knowledge.  This structured approach makes it much easier to refine and interpret the decision tree.
