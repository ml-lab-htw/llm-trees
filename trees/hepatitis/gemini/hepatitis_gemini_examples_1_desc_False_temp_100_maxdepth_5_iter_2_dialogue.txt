Explanation of Threshold Choices and Logic:

* **Bilirubin:** A common liver function test. Higher levels often indicate more severe liver disease. 1.2 mg/dL is used as an initial split point.
* **Ascites:** The presence of fluid in the abdomen.  A serious complication of liver disease.
* **Albumin:**  Low albumin can indicate poor liver function and worse prognosis. 3.5 g/dL chosen as a possible cutoff.
* **Alkaline Phosphatase:**  Elevated levels often seen in liver disease. 120 units/liter used as a potential dividing point.
* **Prothrombin Time:**  Measures blood clotting time.  Elevated in liver disease and indicates higher risk of bleeding. 13 seconds used as a possible threshold.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Real-World Data:** The effectiveness of these thresholds highly depends on the characteristics of your dataset.  You should analyze your data's distributions and consider medical literature for informed threshold selection.
* **Feature Importance:** Decision trees implicitly determine feature importance.  You can get more insight into this by training a `DecisionTreeClassifier` on your dataset and examining the `feature_importances_` attribute. This can help refine your decision tree logic.
* **Tree Depth:**  A depth of 5 might be limiting. You might achieve better performance with a greater depth, but be mindful of overfitting.
* **Evaluation:** Always evaluate your decision tree using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on a held-out test set to ensure it generalizes well.  Consider techniques like cross-validation for robust evaluation.

This improved version uses more medically relevant features and thresholds (though they are still examples and need tuning with your data) and provides a more robust structure for building your prediction function.  The example thresholds and the tree logic reflect general medical knowledge about liver disease, but you absolutely *must* validate and adjust these values with your specific dataset and consult with a medical expert if possible.
