```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.5  # Threshold of 1.5 mg/dL for Bilirubin

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function uses `BILIRUBIN` as the deciding feature with a threshold of 1.5 mg/dL. This is a reasonable estimate, as normal bilirubin levels are typically below 1.2 mg/dL, and elevated levels can suggest liver dysfunction and a poorer prognosis.  Remember, this is a simplified model and without real-world data, the optimal feature and threshold are unknown.  This function provides the structure and logic for a depth-1 decision tree and incorporates domain knowledge for a plausible example.
