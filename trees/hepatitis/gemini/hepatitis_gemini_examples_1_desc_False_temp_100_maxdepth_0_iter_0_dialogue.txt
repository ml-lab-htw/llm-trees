        X["ASCITES"] == 0,
        X["ALBUMIN"] > 2.8
    ]

    if nodes[0]:

This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree logic. Remember, this is a demonstration and should not be used for real medical decisions.  The thresholds (e.g., 2.0 for bilirubin, 15 for prothrombin time, 3.0 for albumin, 50 for age) are for illustrative purposes only and would need to be determined through analysis of actual patient data in a real-world application.  A real-world application would also likely benefit from more sophisticated model selection and evaluation.
