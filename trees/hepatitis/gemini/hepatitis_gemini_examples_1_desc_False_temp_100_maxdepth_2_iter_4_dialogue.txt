```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # Threshold for bilirubin (normal is around 1.2)
    nodes[1] = X["AGE"] <= 50         # Hypothetical threshold for age (you can replace this with actual data)
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0    # Threshold for prothrombin time (normal is around 11-14 seconds)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function directly implements the decision tree logic described previously.  Remember, this is a simplified example and shouldn't be used in a real medical context.  A real-world application would require training a model on actual patient data.  The thresholds used (e.g., 2.0 for bilirubin) are also illustrative and would need to be determined from data analysis in a real application.
