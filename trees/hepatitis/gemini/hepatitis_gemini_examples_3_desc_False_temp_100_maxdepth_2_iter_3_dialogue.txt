You're asking to build a decision tree without training data, which means we'll have to rely on general medical knowledge and some assumptions to choose relevant thresholds. 

**Important:** This is for illustration only and should **not** be used for actual medical decision-making.

Let's assume the following features are important for a depth-2 decision tree:

1. **BILIRUBIN:** Elevated bilirubin is a sign of liver dysfunction and could indicate a poor prognosis.
2. **ALBUMIN:** Low albumin levels are associated with liver disease severity and worse outcomes.

Here's a Python function representing a possible decision tree:

```python
def predict_survival(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts patient survival based on a simplified decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary containing patient features. 

    Returns:
        tuple: Prediction (1 for survival, 0 for death) and a list
               representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None] 

    # Node 1: Check if Bilirubin is above a threshold (e.g., 2.0 mg/dL)
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] > 2.0 

    # Node 2: Check if Albumin is below a threshold (e.g., 3.5 g/dL)
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] < 3.5

    # Decision Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # High Bilirubin
        if nodes[1]:  # Low Albumin
            prediction = 0  # Higher risk of death
        else: 
            prediction = 1  # May survive, but high bilirubin is concerning
    else:  # Normal Bilirubin
        prediction = 1  # More likely to survive

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

* **nodes:** This list stores whether the conditions at each node are met (`True` or `False`), providing insight into the decision path.
* **Node 1:** Checks if bilirubin is above 2.0 mg/dL. This threshold is a simplified example; the actual clinical threshold may vary.
* **Node 2:**  If bilirubin is high, this node checks for low albumin (below 3.5 g/dL), another indicator of poor liver function.
* **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements translate the tree's branches into predictions.

**To use this function:**

```python
patient_data = {"BILIRUBIN": 2.5, "ALBUMIN": 3.2, "AGE": 60} 
prediction, nodes = predict_survival(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction (1=Survive, 0=Die): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}") 
```

**Remember:** This is a very simplified example. A robust model would require:

* **Training Data:** To learn patterns and thresholds from real patient data.
* **More Features:** To capture the complexity of survival prediction.
* **Model Evaluation:** To assess its performance and potential biases.
