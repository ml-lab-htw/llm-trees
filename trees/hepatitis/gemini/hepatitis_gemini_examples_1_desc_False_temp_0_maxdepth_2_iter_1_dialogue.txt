```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # Threshold for Bilirubin (mg/dL)
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15.0   # Threshold for Prothrombin Time (seconds)
    nodes[2] = X["ASCITES"] == 1 #Checking ascites for survival 

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0
        else:

            prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, [int(n) if n is not None else None for n in [nodes[0],nodes[2] if nodes[0] else nodes[1]]] 

```


**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **Bilirubin (2.0 mg/dL):**  A bilirubin level above 2.0 mg/dL is often considered clinically significant and suggests a greater degree of liver dysfunction.
* **Prothrombin Time (15.0 seconds):** A normal prothrombin time is typically around 11-14 seconds.  A value above 15 seconds indicates a potential clotting problem, often associated with more severe liver disease.
* **Ascites:** The presence of ascites is a serious complication often indicating advanced liver disease.
* **Simplified Tree Structure:** The if/else structure directly reflects the decision tree's branches based on the chosen features and thresholds.



**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'AGE': 50,
    'SEX': 2,
    'STEROID': 1,
    'ANTIVIRALS': 0,
    'FATIGUE': 1,
    'MALAISE': 1,
    'ANOREXIA': 1,
    'LIVER BIG': 1,
    'LIVER FIRM': 1,
    'SPLEEN PALPABLE': 1,
    'SPIDERS': 1,
    'ASCITES': 1,
    'VARICES': 1,
    'BILIRUBIN': 1.5,
    'ALK PHOSPHATE': 150,
    'SGOT': 100,
    'ALBUMIN': 3.5,
    'PROTIME': 12,
    'HISTOLOGY': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction (0=die, 1=live): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

patient_data['BILIRUBIN'] = 3.0
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction (0=die, 1=live): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```




**Important Note:** These thresholds are examples and may not be optimal for all datasets. In a real-world application, you should determine the best thresholds using techniques like cross-validation on your training data.  This is crucial for building a robust and accurate model.  The provided function structure is flexible and can be adapted to use different features and thresholds as needed.
