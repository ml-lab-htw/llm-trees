```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [
        X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5,
        X["ASCITES"] == 0,
        X["ALBUMIN"] > 2.8
    ]

    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives
    elif nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Dies
    elif not nodes[0] and nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes


```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]** checks whether the patient's **BILIRUBIN** level is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL. This is the first condition in our decision tree.
- **nodes[1]** (checked only if **nodes[0]** is `True`) checks whether the patient's **PROTIME** (prothrombin time) is less than or equal to 12.5 seconds.
- Based on these two conditions, the function returns the prediction (whether the patient survives or dies) and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
