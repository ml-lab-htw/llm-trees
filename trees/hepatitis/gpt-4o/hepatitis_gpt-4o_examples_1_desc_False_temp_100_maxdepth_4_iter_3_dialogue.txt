Here is the formatted Python function for the decision tree based on the features provided. The function implements the logic for making a single prediction and returns the corresponding truth values (`1` or `0`) for the inner nodes at each step.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient survives (1) or dies (0) based on the provided features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing feature values with the exact keys specified.

    Returns:
    tuple:
        - prediction (int): 0 for dies or 1 for survives.
        - nodes (list): A list representing the truth values (1 or 0) of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.8  # First split on BILIRUBIN
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8 if nodes[0] else X["ASCITES"] == 0  # Second split
    nodes[2] = X["FATIGUE"] == 0 if nodes[0] and not nodes[1] else X["PROTIME"] <= 10.5  # Third split
    nodes[3] = False  # This node is not used for this tree, placeholder
    
    # Use the nodes to make a prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 1.8
        if nodes[1]:  # ALBUMIN <= 2.8
            prediction = 0  # dies
        else:  # ALBUMIN > 2.8
            if nodes[2]:  # FATIGUE == 0
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:  # FATIGUE == 1

### Example Usage:

```python
# Input features for a patient
X = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 1,  # female
    "STEROID": 0,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 1,
    "FATIGUE": 0,
    "MALAISE": 0,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 1,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.2,  # mg/dL
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,  # units/liter
    "SGOT": 43,  # units/liter
    "ALBUMIN": 3.5,  # g/dL
    "PROTIME": 9.8,  # seconds
    "HISTOLOGY": 1,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {'survives' if prediction == 1 else 'dies'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Example Output:

For the input provided:
```
Prediction: survives
Nodes: [1, 0, 1, False]
```

### Explanation:
- The truth values (`nodes` list) for each inner node indicate whether the condition in the decision tree at that node was satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`).
- Based on the conditions:
  - BILIRUBIN (1.2 â‰¤ 1.8) satisfies the condition, so `nodes[0] = 1`.
  - ALBUMIN (3.5 > 2.8) does not satisfy the condition at node 1 for the branch we follow, so `nodes[1] = 0`.
  - FATIGUE (0 == 0) satisfies the condition, so `nodes[2] = 1`.
  - Node 3 is not used in this plan, so its value is `False`.

This output indicates that the patient survives based on the decision tree rules.
