Based on the provided decision tree and the request for Python code to encapsulate it, here's a function that will take a dictionary of features and return a classification ("live" or "die") based on the decision tree. It also returns a list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the tree was satisfied or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 8
    
    # Define the conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["AGE"] <= 50
    nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.2
    nodes[2] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5
    nodes[3] = X["ASCITES"] == 1
    nodes[4] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.5
    nodes[5] = X["VARICES"] == 1
    nodes[6] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Age <= 50
        if nodes[1]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 1.2
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:  # BILIRUBIN > 1.2
            if nodes[2]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 3.5
                prediction = 1  # Survives
            else:  # BILIRUBIN > 3.5
                if nodes[3]:  # ASCITES = yes
                    prediction = 0  # Dies
                else:  # ASCITES = no
                    if nodes[4]:  # ALBUMIN <= 2.5
                        prediction = 0  # Dies
                    else:  # ALBUMIN > 2.5
                        prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:  # Age > 50
        if nodes[3]:  # ASCITES = yes
            prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:  # ASCITES = no
            if nodes[5]:  # VARICES = yes
                prediction = 0  # Dies
            else:  # VARICES = no
                if nodes[6]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.0
                    prediction = 1  # Survives
                else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.0
                    prediction = 1  # Survives

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 0,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 1,
    "FATIGUE": 0,
    "MALAISE": 0,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 0,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 1,
    "BILIRUBIN": 2.7,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 110,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.1,
    "PROTIME": 11.2,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'live' if prediction == 1 else 'die'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values for a patient. The function evaluates each condition in the decision tree and constructs a `nodes` list, where each entry is `True` (condition satisfied) or `False` (condition not satisfied). The function then navigates through the decision tree based on these conditions and ultimately returns a prediction and the list of conditions.

Note: This function assumes that if a condition is not explicitly checked (for example, `ASCITES` is 0 or `VARICES` is 0), the prediction and nodes list are constructed accordingly. Adjust thresholds and checks as necessary based on accurate medical data and decision support systems.
