Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a patient survives (1) or dies (0). The function returns the prediction as well as a list representing the truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values for inner nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the thresholds for the decision tree nodes based on features
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.5  # Check if bilirubin is less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dL
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8    # Check if albumin is less than or equal to 2.8 g/dL
    nodes[2] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15     # Check if prothrombin time is less than or equal to 15 seconds
    nodes[3] = X["HISTOLOGY"] == 0    # Check if histology is no (equal to 0)
    nodes[4] = X["HISTOLOGY"] == 1    # Check if histology is yes (equal to 1)
    
    # Implement the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If bilirubin is <= 2.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If albumin is <= 2.8
            prediction = 0  # Patient dies
        else:  # If albumin is > 2.8
            if nodes[2]:  # If prothrombin time <= 15 seconds
                prediction = 1  # Patient survives
            else:  # If prothrombin time > 15 seconds
                prediction = 0  # Patient dies
    else:  # If bilirubin > 2.5
        if nodes[3]:  # If histology is no
            prediction = 0  # Patient dies
        else:  # If histology is yes
            prediction = 1  # Patient survives
    
    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Input**:  
   - `X`: A dictionary where keys are feature names as provided (`AGE`, `SEX`, `STEROID`, `BILIRUBIN`, etc.), and values are the corresponding feature values for a patient. 

2. **Nodes**:
   - The `nodes` list stores boolean truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree, indicating whether each condition is satisfied for the given input data.

3. **Thresholds**:  
   - The thresholds are filled based on medical significance:
     - `BILIRUBIN <= 2.5`: Threshold for bilirubin to split into high/low risk groups.
     - `ALBUMIN <= 2.8`: Albumin level to separate severe liver dysfunction.
     - `PROTIME <= 15`: A significant cutoff for prothrombin time indicating poor liver function.
     - `HISTOLOGY == 0/1`: Presence or absence of histologic evidence of severe liver disease.

4. **Logic**:  
   - The decision tree logic is implemented using nested `if` statements.

5. **Output**:  
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: A binary classification, where `1` means the patient survives and `0` means the patient dies.
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values representing which conditions (inner nodes) were satisfied during the decision-making process.

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s how you could use the `predict` function to make a prediction for a patient:

```python
# Example input for a patient
patient_data = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 1,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 1,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 1,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 1,
    "BILIRUBIN": 3.2,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 50,
    "ALBUMIN": 2.5,
    "PROTIME": 16,
    "HISTOLOGY": 0,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print("Prediction:", "Survives" if prediction == 1 else "Dies")
print("Decision Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the above input (where bilirubin is high, albumin is low, prothrombin time is high, and histology is absent):
```
Prediction: Dies
Decision Nodes: [False, True, False, True, False]
```

- `nodes[0]` is `False` because bilirubin > 2.5.
- `nodes[1]` is `True` because albumin <= 2.8.
- `nodes[2]` is `False` because prothrombin time > 15.
- `nodes[3]` is `True` because histology == 0.
- `nodes[4]` is `False` because histology != 1.
