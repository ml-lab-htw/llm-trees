Here is the Python function implementation for your decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The decision tree is configured with a depth of 1 and identifies whether a patient survives (`live = 1`) or dies (`die = 0`).

### Python Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict if a patient survives or dies based on bilirubin levels.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: 
            - prediction (int): 0 = dies, 1 = survives.
            - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner node conditions (1 if satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = [None]
    # Decision based on BILIRUBIN levels
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.3

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # survives
    else:
        prediction = 0  # dies
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Threshold Selection**:
   - The decision tree uses `BILIRUBIN` as the splitting feature and a threshold of `1.3 mg/dL` to classify patients. This threshold was chosen based on medical expertise (elevated bilirubin indicates liver dysfunction, which can increase mortality risk).

2. **Nodes List**:
   - The `nodes` list represents the truth values of conditions at the inner nodes of the tree. The list contains `1` if the condition is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.
   - In this tree, there is only one condition (inner node): `"BILIRUBIN" <= 1.3`.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If `BILIRUBIN <= 1.3`, the patient is predicted to survive (`1`).
   - If `BILIRUBIN > 1.3`, the patient is predicted to die (`0`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input: A sample patient with specific values for features
patient = {
    "AGE": 55,
    "SEX": 2,  # Male
    "STEROID": 1,  # Yes
    "ANTIVIRALS": 1,  # Yes
    "FATIGUE": 1,  # Yes
    "MALAISE": 1,  # Yes
    "ANOREXIA": 0,  # No
    "LIVER BIG": 1,  # Yes
    "LIVER FIRM": 1,  # Yes
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,  # No
    "SPIDERS": 0,  # No
    "ASCITES": 0,  # No
    "VARICES": 1,  # Yes
    "BILIRUBIN": 2.0,  # Elevated
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 34,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.5,
    "PROTIME": 10,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1  # Yes
}

# Perform prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient)

print("Prediction:", "Survives" if prediction == 1 else "Dies")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Prediction: Dies
Node Truth Values: [0]
```

Here, since the patient's bilirubin level (`BILIRUBIN = 2.0`) exceeds the threshold of `1.3 mg/dL`, the prediction is `Dies`, and the truth value for the condition is `0` (`BILIRUBIN <= 1.3` is not satisfied).
