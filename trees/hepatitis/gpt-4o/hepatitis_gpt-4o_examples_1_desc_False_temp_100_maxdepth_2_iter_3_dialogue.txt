Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree as per your request:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First decision node: Bilirubin level
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5

    # Second decision node: Ascites (evaluated if bilirubin <= 3.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ASCITES"] == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
    else:
        # Second decision node: Albumin level (evaluated if bilirubin > 3.5)
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 2.8
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The first decision node is based on **BILIRUBIN**. If the bilirubin level is less than or equal to 3.5 mg/dL, the decision tree proceeds to check **ASCITES**.
- If **ASCITES** is absent (i.e., `ASCITES == 0`), the patient is predicted to survive (`prediction = 1`). If ascites is present (`ASCITES == 1`), the patient is predicted to die (`prediction = 0`).
- If the bilirubin level is greater than 3.5 mg/dL, the decision tree proceeds to check the **ALBUMIN** level. If the albumin level is greater than 2.8 g/dL, the patient is predicted to survive (`prediction = 1`). If the albumin level is less than or equal to 2.8 g/dL, the patient is predicted to die (`prediction = 0`).
  
This function returns two values:
1. `prediction`: The classification result (0 = dies, 1 = survives).
2. `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing whether the condition at each decision node is satisfied (`True` or `False`). For example, `[True, False]` means the first condition (`BILIRUBIN <= 3.5`) is satisfied, but the second condition (based on **ASCITES** or **ALBUMIN**) is not.
