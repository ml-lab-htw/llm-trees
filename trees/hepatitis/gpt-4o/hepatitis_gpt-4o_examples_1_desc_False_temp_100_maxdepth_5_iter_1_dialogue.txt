Here is a Python implementation of the described decision tree classifier. The function `predict` takes an input dictionary of features and returns both a prediction (0 = die, 1 = live) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient survives or dies based on input features and
    evaluates the truth values of the inner nodes in a decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Input features with keys as specified in the problem statement.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = die, 1 = live) and
           a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    # Define decision rules
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.8
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 13.5
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    nodes[3] = X["ASCITES"] == 0  # 0 = no
    nodes[4] = X["ALK PHOSPHATE"] <= 100

    # Predict outcome
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # dies
            else:
                prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if not nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # dies
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
Suppose we have the following patient data:

```python
patient_data = {
    "AGE": 56,
    "SEX": 1,  # female
    "STEROID": 1,  # yes
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,  # no
    "FATIGUE": 1,  # yes
    "MALAISE": 0,  # no
    "ANOREXIA": 0,  # no
    "LIVER BIG": 1,  # yes
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,  # no
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,  # no
    "SPIDERS": 0,  # no
    "ASCITES": 0,  # no
    "VARICES": 0,  # no
    "BILIRUBIN": 2.1,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 45,
    "ALBUMIN": 2.9,
    "PROTIME": 12.5,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1,  # yes
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", "Live" if prediction == 1 else "Die")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
Prediction: Die
Node Truth Values: [False, True, True, True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Predict Function
1. **Node Truth Values:**
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if bilirubin level is <= 1.8. (Primary distinction between survivable and severe cases.)
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if prothrombin time is <= 13.5. (Indicates clotting function.)
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if albumin level is <= 3.0. (Indicates nutritional and liver synthesis capacity.)
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if ascites is absent (0 = no). (Clinical parameter often indicative of worse prognosis.)
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if alkaline phosphatase is <= 100. (Additional indicator related to liver function.)

2. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The tree splits based on the conditions. The root decision starts with bilirubin, then progresses to prothrombin time, albumin level, ascites, and alkaline phosphatase sequentially.
   - At each split, a patient's features determine which branch to follow.
   - The final prediction is assigned based on leaf nodes:
     - `0` = Patient dies
     - `1` = Patient survives

This implementation ensures the logic appropriately follows the decision tree structure while reflecting the specified feature thresholds and encoding.
