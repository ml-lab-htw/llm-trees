Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on your specified features and target variable. The tree has a maximum depth of 2, and the thresholds used are meaningful values derived from clinical knowledge:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient survives (1) or dies (0) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes.
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # First split on bilirubin level.
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.5  # Second split on albumin level.
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 14.0  # Second split on prothrombin time.
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are feature names (e.g., `"BILIRUBIN"`, `"ALBUMIN"`, `"PROTIME"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values for a patient.
2. **Nodes List**: A list `nodes` is used to store the truth values of the inner nodes (whether the condition at each node is satisfied or not).
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The first decision is based on the bilirubin level (`"BILIRUBIN" <= 2.0`).
   - If the bilirubin level is less than or equal to 2.0, the second decision is based on the albumin level (`"ALBUMIN" <= 3.5`).
   - If the bilirubin level is greater than 2.0, the second decision is based on the prothrombin time (`"PROTIME" <= 14.0`).
4. **Prediction**: The function returns the prediction (0 = dies, 1 = survives) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features for a patient
patient_features = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 1,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 1,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 1,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 1,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.8,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 120,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.2,
    "PROTIME": 13.5,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)

# Output results
print("Prediction (0 = dies, 1 = survives):", prediction)
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the above input:
```
Prediction (0 = dies, 1 = survives): 0
Inner node truth values: [True, True]
```

This indicates that the patient is predicted to die (`0`), and both inner node conditions are satisfied (`[True, True]`).
