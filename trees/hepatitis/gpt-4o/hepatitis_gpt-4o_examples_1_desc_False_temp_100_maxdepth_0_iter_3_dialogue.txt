Here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Bilirubin <= 2.0
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Albumin <= 3.0
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        # Node 2: Prothrombin time <= 14
        nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 14
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. The first node checks if the bilirubin level is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL.
2. If this condition is met, the second node checks if the albumin level is less than or equal to 3.0 g/dL.
   - If albumin is below or equal to 3.0 g/dL, the patient is predicted to **die** (0).
   - If albumin is above 3.0 g/dL, the patient is predicted to **survive** (1).
3. If the bilirubin level is above 2.0 mg/dL, the second node checks if the prothrombin time is less than or equal to 14 seconds.
   - If prothrombin time is less than or equal to 14 seconds, the patient is predicted to **survive** (1).
   - If prothrombin time is above 14 seconds, the patient is predicted to **die** (0).

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 0,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 1,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 1,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.5,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 600,
    "SGOT": 85,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.5,
    "PROTIME": 12,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this `X` dictionary, the patient has a bilirubin of 1.5 mg/dL and albumin of 3.5 g/dL, so the decision tree would predict survival (1).
