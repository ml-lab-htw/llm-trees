Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for predicting patient survival (`die = 0`, `live = 1`) based on the given features and thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list to record truth values for inner nodes
    nodes = [None, None, None]

    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.0  # Root decision: bilirubin threshold at 3.0 mg/dL
    if nodes[0]:  # If bilirubin is less than or equal to 3.0
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.5  # Check albumin level
        if nodes[1]:  # If albumin is less than or equal to 2.5
            nodes[2] = X["PROTIME"] <= 7.0  # Check prothrombin time
            if nodes[2]:  # If prothrombin time is less than or equal to 7.0
                prediction = 0  # Patient dies
            else:  # Prothrombin time is greater than 7.0
                prediction = 1  # Patient survives
        else:  # Albumin is greater than 2.5
            prediction = 1  # Patient survives
    else:  # Bilirubin is greater than 3.0
        nodes[1] = X["AGE"] <= 50  # Check age
        if nodes[1]:  # If age is less than or equal to 50
            prediction = 1  # Patient survives
        else:  # Age is greater than 50
            prediction = 0  # Patient dies

    # Return the prediction and truth values for the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Root Node**:
   - Splits on `BILIRUBIN` (bilirubin level ≤ 3.0 is used as the root split). Elevated bilirubin indicates poor liver function and potential complications.
   
2. **Second Level**:
   - If `BILIRUBIN <= 3.0`:
     - Splits on `ALBUMIN` (albumin level ≤ 2.5). Low albumin indicates a failure in liver protein synthesis, which is a serious condition.
   - If `BILIRUBIN > 3.0`:
     - Splits on `AGE` (age ≤ 50). Younger patients typically have better survival outcomes compared to older patients with the same condition.
   
3. **Third Level**:
   - If `BILIRUBIN <= 3.0` and `ALBUMIN <= 2.5`:
     - Splits on `PROTIME` (prothrombin time ≤ 7.0). A short prothrombin time indicates severe clotting issues, a predictor of poor outcomes.

### Example Usage:
#### Input:
Assume we have a patient with the following feature values:
```python
test_patient = {
    "AGE": 60,
    "SEX": 2,  # Male
    "STEROID": 1,  # Yes
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,  # No
    "FATIGUE": 1,  # Yes
    "MALAISE": 1,  # Yes
    "ANOREXIA": 0,  # No
    "LIVER BIG": 0,  # No
    "LIVER FIRM": 1,  # Yes
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,  # No
    "SPIDERS": 1,  # Yes
    "ASCITES": 1,  # Yes
    "VARICES": 1,  # Yes
    "BILIRUBIN": 4.2,  # Elevated
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 120,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.1,  # Normal
    "PROTIME": 10.2,  # Normal
    "HISTOLOGY": 0  # No
}
```

#### Call:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(test_patient)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (dies), or 1 (survives)
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: e.g., [False, True, None]
```

#### Output:
For this patient:
- `nodes[0] = False` because `BILIRUBIN > 3.0`.
- `nodes[1] = False` because `AGE > 50`.
- Final `prediction = 0` (dies).
