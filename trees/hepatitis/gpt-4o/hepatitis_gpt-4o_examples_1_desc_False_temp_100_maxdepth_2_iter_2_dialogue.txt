def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root Node: Decision based on PROTIME (Prothrombin time in seconds)
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 14.0
    # Left Subtree: Decision based on ALBUMIN level (g/dL)
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 3.0
    # Right Subtree: Decision based on BILIRUBIN (mg/dL)
    nodes[2] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
    else:
        if nodes[2]:

        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Input**: The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (e.g., "PROTIME", "ALBUMIN", "BILIRUBIN"), and the values are the corresponding values for a given patient.
   
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes of the decision tree. There are two decision nodes in this tree, so the list has a length of 2.
   
3. **Root Node**: The first decision is based on the patient's **prothrombin time** (`PROTIME`). If it is less than or equal to 14.0 seconds (`nodes[0]`), the function proceeds to the left subtree, otherwise, it proceeds to the right subtree.
   
4. **Left Subtree**: If the patient's **prothrombin time** is normal (â‰¤ 14.0 seconds), the next decision is based on the **albumin level** (`ALBUMIN`).
   - If the albumin level is greater than 3.0 g/dL (`nodes[1]`), the patient is predicted to **survive** (`prediction = 1`).
   - If the albumin level is less than or equal to 3.0 g/dL, the patient is predicted to **die** (`prediction = 0`).

5. **Right Subtree**: If the patient's **prothrombin time** is prolonged (> 14.0 seconds), the next decision is based on the **bilirubin level** (`BILIRUBIN`).
   - If the bilirubin level is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (`nodes[1]`), the patient is predicted to **survive** (`prediction = 1`).
   - If the bilirubin level is greater than 2.0 mg/dL, the patient is predicted to **die** (`prediction = 0`).

6. **Output**: The function returns:
   - The predicted class (`0` for "dies", `1` for "survives").
   - A list `nodes` containing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

### Example usage:
```python
X = {
    "AGE": 55,
    "SEX": 1,  # Female
    "STEROID": 0,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 1,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.8,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 300,
    "SGOT": 50,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.5,
    "PROTIME": 13.5,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the patient's **prothrombin time** is normal (13.5 seconds), and their **albumin level** is above 3.0 g/dL, leading to the prediction that the patient **survives** (`prediction = 1`). The decision path in the tree is reflected in the `nodes` list as `[True, True]`.
