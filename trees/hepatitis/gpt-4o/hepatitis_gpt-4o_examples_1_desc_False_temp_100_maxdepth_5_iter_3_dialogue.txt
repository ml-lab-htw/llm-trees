Here is the Python function based on the decision tree provided, formatted with the correct feature keys and target variable encoding. This function evaluates whether a patient survives (1) or dies (0) using a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Root node (bilirubin level)
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Albumin level <= 3.5
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Fatigue
            nodes[2] = X["FATIGUE"] == 0
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Predict survives
                prediction = 1  # Survives
            else:
                # Node 4: Predict dies
                prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            # Node 3: Age <= 50
            nodes[3] = X["AGE"] <= 50
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 4: Predict survives
                prediction = 1  # Survives
            else:
                # Node 4: Predict dies
                prediction = 0  # Dies
    else:
        # Node 1: Prothrombin time <= 15.0
        nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15.0
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Ascites
            nodes[2] = X["ASCITES"] == 0
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Predict survives
                prediction = 1  # Survives
            else:
                # Node 4: Predict dies
                prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            # Node 3: Liver big
            nodes[3] = X["LIVER BIG"] == 1
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 4: Predict dies
                prediction = 0  # Dies
            else:
                # Node 4: Predict survives
                prediction = 1  # Survives

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary, `X`, where keys are feature names (exactly as spelled in the feature list), and values are their respective values for a patient.

2. **Nodes**: A list `nodes` stores the truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for each inner node of the decision tree. The tree has 5 nodes, corresponding to its maximum depth.

3. **Conditions**: Each condition corresponds to an inner decision node of the tree. They are based on thresholds or categorical feature values.

4. **Output**: 
   - `prediction`: The final classification result (0 = dies, 1 = survives).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes that were evaluated during the prediction.

### Example Input and Output:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 1,
    "STEROID": 1,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 0,
    "ANOREXIA": 1,
    "LIVER BIG": 0,
    "LIVER FIRM": 1,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.8,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 300,
    "SGOT": 40,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.2,
    "PROTIME": 14,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

# Example output
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (dies)
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: Nodes: [1, 1, 0, None, None]
```

In the above example:
- **Node 0 (BILIRUBIN <= 2.0)**: True (1), so we move to the next level.
- **Node 1 (ALBUMIN <= 3.5)**: True (1), so we evaluate fatigue.
- **Node 2 (FATIGUE == 0)**: False (0), so the patient is predicted to die (0).
- Remaining nodes are not evaluated as the prediction is decided before reaching them.

This structure provides the prediction and clear reasoning for how it was reached.
