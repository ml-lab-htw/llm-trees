Sure, based on the given features and the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, here is the Python function to predict the survival of a patient. This function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["AGE"] <= 50
    nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.5 if nodes[0] else X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survive
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Die
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survive
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Die
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a patient.
2. The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each decision node.
3. `nodes[0]` evaluates the condition of the first decision node: whether the patient's age is <= 50.
4. `nodes[1]` evaluates the condition of the second decision node. If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., age <= 50), it checks if the bilirubin level is <= 1.5. Otherwise, it checks if the bilirubin level is <= 2.0.
5. Based on the truth values of these nodes, the function makes a prediction:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` and `nodes[1]` is `True`: the patient is predicted to survive.
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` and `nodes[1]` is `False`: the patient is predicted to die.
   - If `nodes[0]` is `False` and `nodes[1]` is `True`: the patient is predicted to survive.
   - If `nodes[0]` is `False` and `nodes[1]` is `False`: the patient is predicted to die.
6. Finally, the function returns the prediction and the `nodes` list.

**Example Usage:**
```python
X = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 0,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 0,
    "MALAISE": 0,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 0,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.2,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 20,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.5,
    "PROTIME": 12,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Survive' if prediction == 1 else 'Die'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This example should output:
```
Prediction: Survive, Nodes: [True, True]
```
