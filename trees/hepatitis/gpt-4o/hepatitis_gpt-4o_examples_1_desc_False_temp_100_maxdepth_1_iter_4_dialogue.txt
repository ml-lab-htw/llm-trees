Here is the Python function based on the decision tree using the feature `BILIRUBIN` as the most important feature to classify whether a patient survives or dies. The function adheres to the exact requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict if a patient survives (1) or dies (0) based on the decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary representing the feature values of the patient.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # There is 1 inner node in this decision tree.
    
    # The decision condition for the tree
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0  # Check if bilirubin is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL.
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the condition at the root node is satisfied.
        prediction = 1  # Patient survives (live: 1)
    else:  # If the condition at the root node is not satisfied.
        prediction = 0  # Patient dies (die: 0)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example usage of the function:

```python
# Example input: a patient with bilirubin level of 1.8 mg/dL
patient_data = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 1,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 1,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 1,
    "VARICES": 1,
    "BILIRUBIN": 1.8,  # Important feature for the decision tree
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 55,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.4,
    "PROTIME": 12.5,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print("Prediction (1 = live, 0 = die):", prediction)
print("Inner nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output
For the input above, the output will be:
```
Prediction (1 = live, 0 = die): 1
Inner nodes truth values: [True]
``` 

---

If the bilirubin value were to increase (e.g., `BILIRUBIN = 3.0`), the output would be:
```
Prediction (1 = live, 0 = die): 0
Inner nodes truth values: [False]
``` 

### Explanation
1. `nodes[0]` evaluates the truth value of the condition at the inner node (`BILIRUBIN <= 2.0`).
2. The prediction is made based on whether the condition is satisfied or not.
3. The function returns both the **prediction** (`1` or `0`) and the **list of node conditions** (`[True]` or `[False]`).
