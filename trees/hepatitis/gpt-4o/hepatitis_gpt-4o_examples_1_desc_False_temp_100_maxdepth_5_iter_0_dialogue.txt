Here is the Python function implementation for your decision tree, modeled after your requirements. This function predicts whether a patient survives (`1`) or dies (`0`) based on the provided features and returns the corresponding decision tree path as a list of truth values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient survives or dies based on input features. 

    Args:
        X: dict, input features with key-value pairs.

    Returns:
        prediction: int, 0 for dies, 1 for survives.
        nodes: List of int, truth values (1 or 0) of intermediate decisions made in the tree.
    """

    nodes = 5 * [None]  # To store truth values of the tree's inner nodes

    # Decision Tree Logic
    # Node 0: Check bilirubin <= 2.0
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check albumin level <= 3.5
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.5

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check fatigue == 0 (no fatigue)
            nodes[2] = X["FATIGUE"] == 0

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Survives (no fatigue, low bilirubin, and low albumin)
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Survives (low bilirubin and high albumin)
    else:
        # Node 3: Check prothrombin time <= 15
        nodes[3] = X["PROTIME"] <= 15

        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Check ascites == 0 (no ascites)
            nodes[4] = X["ASCITES"] == 0

            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies (high bilirubin and high prothrombin time)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Tree Structure**:
   - The decision tree structure closely follows the one provided earlier while conforming to the exact feature spelling and ranges given in your description.
   - The condition checks involve features such as `BILIRUBIN`, `ALBUMIN`, `FATIGUE`, `PROTIME`, and `ASCITES`.

2. **Nodes List**:
   - `nodes` is a list of 5 entries (for the depth-5 decision tree), where each position corresponds to the truth value of an inner node condition.
   - A value of `1` indicates that the condition of the respective node was satisfied, and `0` means otherwise.

3. **Input Feature Dictionary (`X`)**:
   - The function expects a dictionary (`X`) as input where keys match the exact feature names (e.g., `BILIRUBIN`, `ALBUMIN`, etc.) and values correspond to the respective feature values.

4. **Decision Flow**:
   - Node 0 checks if bilirubin is below or equal to 2.0, which is a critical threshold for liver function.
   - Node 1 checks if albumin level is low (≤ 3.5 g/dL), a key marker for survival.
   - Node 2 checks the presence of fatigue. If there's no fatigue, the patient survives; otherwise, there's a greater risk of dying.
   - Node 3 checks prothrombin time (≤ 15 seconds). High prothrombin times (> 15) indicate poor liver function and are strongly correlated with higher mortality.
   - Node 4 checks for ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen). The absence of ascites is a positive survival indicator.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Based on the intermediate conditions and their outcomes, the final prediction is determined (0 for `dies`, 1 for `survives`).

### Example Usage
```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    "AGE": 45,
    "SEX": 1,
    "STEROID": 1,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 1,
    "MALAISE": 1,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 1,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 1,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 3.2,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 102,
    "SGOT": 78,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.3,
    "PROTIME": 16,
    "HISTOLOGY": 0
}

# Get prediction and decision path
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", "Survives" if prediction == 1 else "Dies")
print("Decision Path:", nodes)
```

### Output for Example
With the example `patient_data` provided:
- `BILIRUBIN` is 3.2 (high), leading to the right branch of the tree.
- `PROTIME` is 16 (high), leading to `Dies`.

```
Prediction: Dies
Decision Path: [False, None, None, False, None]
```
