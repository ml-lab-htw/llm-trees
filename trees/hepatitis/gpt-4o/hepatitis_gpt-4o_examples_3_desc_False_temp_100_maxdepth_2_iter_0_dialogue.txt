Based on your request to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the specified features, I will draw upon the meaningful thresholds provided to create the function `predict` that will return a single prediction as well as a list of Boolean values indicating the truth of the inner nodes.

Let's assume the thresholds provided for the decision tree and build the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list for inner node truth values
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First condition: bilirubin level threshold
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second condition: age threshold for patients with low bilirubin
        nodes[1] = X["AGE"] <= 50
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        # Second condition: bilirubin level moderate threshold for patients with high bilirubin
        nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    "AGE": 60,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 1,
    "ANTIVIRALS": 0,
    "FATIGUE": 0,
    "MALAISE": 0,
    "ANOREXIA": 0,
    "LIVER BIG": 0,
    "LIVER FIRM": 0,
    "SPLEEN PALPABLE": 0,
    "SPIDERS": 0,
    "ASCITES": 0,
    "VARICES": 0,
    "BILIRUBIN": 2.0,
    "ALK PHOSPHATE": 85,
    "SGOT": 47,
    "ALBUMIN": 3.5,
    "PROTIME": 12,
    "HISTOLOGY": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {'survives' if prediction == 1 else 'dies'}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Condition (`nodes[0]`)**: Check if the `BILIRUBIN` level is less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.
    - If true, move to the second condition based on `AGE`.
    - If false, move to a different second condition based on `BILIRUBIN` again.

2. **Second Condition (`nodes[1]`)**:
    - **For `nodes[0]` true**: Check if the `AGE` is less than or equal to 50 years.
    - **For `nodes[0]` false**: Check if the `BILIRUBIN` is less than or equal to 3.5 mg/dL.

3. **Predictions**:
    - If both `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are true, or if only `nodes[0]` is false and `nodes[1]` is true, the patient "survives" (1).
    - Otherwise, the patient "dies" (0).

### Example Usage:
The example input dictates that the patient has a `BILIRUBIN` level of 2.0 mg/dL and is 60 years old. The conditions will be checked using this input to predict whether the patient survives or dies based on the decision tree logic provided above.
