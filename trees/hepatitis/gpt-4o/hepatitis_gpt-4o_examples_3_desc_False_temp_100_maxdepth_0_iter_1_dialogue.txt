Given the aforementioned features and target variables, we can create a Python function to implement the decision tree you requested. This function will evaluate the conditions specified in the decision tree and return both a prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Adjust the size according to the depth of your decision tree
    
    # Evaluate decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X['ASCITES'] == 1
    nodes[1] = not nodes[0] and X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 3.0
    nodes[2] = nodes[1] and X['AGE'] <= 50
    nodes[3] = nodes[1] and not nodes[2] and X['ALBUMIN'] <= 3.5

    # Make prediction based on decision nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # ASCITES == 1
        prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
            if nodes[2]:  # AGE <= 50
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.5
                    prediction = 0  # dies
                else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.5
                    prediction = 1  # survives
        else:  # BILIRUBIN > 3.0
            prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Define a sample feature set
sample_patient = {
    'AGE': 60,
    'SEX': 2,
    'STEROID': 0,
    'ANTIVIRALS': 0,
    'FATIGUE': 1,
    'MALAISE': 0,
    'ANOREXIA': 0,
    'LIVER BIG': 0,
    'LIVER FIRM': 0,
    'SPLEEN PALPABLE': 0,
    'SPIDERS': 0,
    'ASCITES': 0,
    'VARICES': 0,
    'BILIRUBIN': 2.0,
    'ALK PHOSPHATE': 85,
    'SGOT': 50,
    'ALBUMIN': 4.0,
    'PROTIME': 11.0,
    'HISTOLOGY': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_patient)
print("Prediction (0: dies, 1: survives):", prediction)
print("Node conditions:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
- `nodes[0]` checks whether ascites is present (`ASCITES == 1`).
- `nodes[1]` checks if bilirubin level is less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL and ascites is not present.
- `nodes[2]` checks if the patient's age is less than or equal to 50 years, given conditions from `nodes[1]` are satisfied.
- `nodes[3]` checks if albumin level is less than or equal to 3.5 g/dL for patients older than 50 years, given conditions from `nodes[1]` are satisfied.

The function finally evaluates these conditions and makes a prediction based on the decision nodes, returning both the prediction and the list of evaluated conditions.
