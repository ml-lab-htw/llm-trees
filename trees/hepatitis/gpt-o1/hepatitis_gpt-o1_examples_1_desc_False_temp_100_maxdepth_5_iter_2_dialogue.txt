The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, returns the prediction (0 for "Died", 1 for "Survived"), and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # List to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: PROTIME <= 42.5
    nodes[0] = int(X['PROTIME'] <= 42.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: ALBUMIN <= 3.05
        nodes[1] = int(X['ALBUMIN'] <= 3.05)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: ASCITES == 0 (No)
            nodes[2] = int(X['ASCITES'] == 0)
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: BILIRUBIN <= 2.85
                nodes[3] = int(X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 2.85)
                if nodes[3]:
                    # Node 4: AGE <= 50
                    nodes[4] = int(X['AGE'] <= 50)
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Survived
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Died
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Died
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Died
        else:
            # Node 2: FATIGUE == 0 (No)
            nodes[2] = int(X['FATIGUE'] == 0)
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Survived
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Died
            # Nodes 3 and 4 are not used in this path
            nodes[3] = None
            nodes[4] = None
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Died
        # Nodes 1 to 4 are not used in this path
        nodes[1] = None
        nodes[2] = None
        nodes[3] = None
        nodes[4] = None

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **nodes[0]**: Checks if `PROTIME` (Prothrombin time) is less than or equal to 42.5 seconds.
- **nodes[1]**: If `nodes[0]` is `True` (1), checks if `ALBUMIN` level is less than or equal to 3.05 g/dL.
- **nodes[2]**: Depending on the path:
  - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, checks if `ASCITES` is `0` (No).
  - If `nodes[1]` is `False`, checks if `FATIGUE` is `0` (No).
- **nodes[3]**: If following the `ASCITES` path, checks if `BILIRUBIN` level is less than or equal to 2.85 mg/dL.
- **nodes[4]**: If following the `BILIRUBIN` path, checks if `AGE` is less than or equal to 50 years.
- **Prediction**: Based on the path taken and the values of the nodes, the function assigns a prediction:
  - `0` for "Died"
  - `1` for "Survived"

**Note on Feature Encoding:**

- **ASCITES**: Encoded as `0` for "No" and `1` for "Yes".
- **FATIGUE**: Encoded as `0` for "No" and `1` for "Yes".
- All feature names must match exactly as provided, including uppercase letters and spaces.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'AGE': 45,
    'SEX': 2,  # 2 = Male
    'STEROID': 1,
    'ANTIVIRALS': 0,
    'FATIGUE': 0,  # No
    'MALAISE': 0,
    'ANOREXIA': 0,
    'LIVER BIG': 1,
    'LIVER FIRM': 1,
    'SPLEEN PALPABLE': 0,
    'SPIDERS': 0,
    'ASCITES': 0,  # No
    'VARICES': 0,
    'BILIRUBIN': 1.5,
    'ALK PHOSPHATE': 85,
    'SGOT': 70,
    'ALBUMIN': 3.2,
    'PROTIME': 35.0,
    'HISTOLOGY': 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Survived' if prediction == 1 else 'Died'}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Survived
Nodes truth values: [1, 0, 1, None, None]
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- **nodes[0]**: `1` because `PROTIME` (35.0) <= 42.5
- **nodes[1]**: `0` because `ALBUMIN` (3.2) > 3.05
- **nodes[2]**: `1` because `FATIGUE` is `0` (No)
- **nodes[3]** and **nodes[4]**: `None` because they are not used in this path
- **Prediction**: `1` (Survived) because the patient does not have fatigue

**Key Points to Remember:**

- Ensure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` match exactly with the feature names provided.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic up to a maximum depth of 5.
- The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values for further analysis if needed.
- The node truth values represent whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`), with `None` indicating that the node was not evaluated in that path.

**Summary of Nodes and Conditions:**

- **Node 0**: `PROTIME <= 42.5`
- **Node 1**: `ALBUMIN <= 3.05`
- **Node 2**:
  - If `Node 1` is `True`: `ASCITES == 0` (No)
  - If `Node 1` is `False`: `FATIGUE == 0` (No)
- **Node 3**: If following `ASCITES` path: `BILIRUBIN <= 2.85`
- **Node 4**: If following `BILIRUBIN` path: `AGE <= 50`

Feel free to use this function with your data to make predictions based on the decision tree classifier.
