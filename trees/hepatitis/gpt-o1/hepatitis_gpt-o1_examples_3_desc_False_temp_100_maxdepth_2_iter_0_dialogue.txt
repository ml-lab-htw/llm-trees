Here's the Python function representing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, based on the provided features and following the specified format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 1.5)
    nodes[1] = int(X["PROTIME"] <= 40)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Survived (live = 1)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Died (die = 0)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Survived (live = 1)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys and Spelling:**
  - `"BILIRUBIN"` corresponds to bilirubin levels in mg/dL.
  - `"PROTIME"` corresponds to prothrombin time in seconds.
  - The feature keys are used exactly as specified, paying close attention to their spelling and capitalization.

- **Thresholds:**
  - **BILIRUBIN ≤ 1.5 mg/dL:** This threshold is meaningful as bilirubin levels up to 1.5 mg/dL are generally considered within normal limits.
  - **PROTIME ≤ 40 seconds:** A prothrombin time greater than the upper limit of normal (usually around 35 seconds) indicates impaired liver function. The threshold of 40 seconds is used here to make a decisive split.

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` represents the truth value of the condition `BILIRUBIN ≤ 1.5`.
  - `nodes[1]` represents the truth value of the condition `PROTIME ≤ 40`.
  - Each entry in `nodes` is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (bilirubin level is ≤ 1.5 mg/dL), the patient is predicted to **Survive** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (bilirubin level is > 1.5 mg/dL), we check `nodes[1]`:
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1` (prothrombin time is ≤ 40 seconds), the patient is predicted to **Die** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If `nodes[1]` is `0` (prothrombin time is > 40 seconds), the patient is predicted to **Survive** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature vector
X_example = {
    'AGE': 50,
    'SEX': 2,  # Male
    'STEROID': 1,
    'ANTIVIRALS': 0,
    'FATIGUE': 1,
    'MALAISE': 0,
    'ANOREXIA': 0,
    'LIVER BIG': 1,
    'LIVER FIRM': 1,
    'SPLEEN PALPABLE': 0,
    'SPIDERS': 0,
    'ASCITES': 0,
    'VARICES': 0,
    'BILIRUBIN': 2.0,  # mg/dL
    'ALK PHOSPHATE': 85,
    'SGOT': 48,
    'ALBUMIN': 3.5,
    'PROTIME': 42,  # seconds
    'HISTOLOGY': 1
}

# Get prediction and node values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Survived" if prediction == 1 else "Died")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Survived
Nodes: [0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] = 0` because `BILIRUBIN` (2.0) > 1.5.
- `nodes[1] = 0` because `PROTIME` (42) > 40.
- Since both conditions are not satisfied, the final prediction is **Survived** (`prediction = 1`).
