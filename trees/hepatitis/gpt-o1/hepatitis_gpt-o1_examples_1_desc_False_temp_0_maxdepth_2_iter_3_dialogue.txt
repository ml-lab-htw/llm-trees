```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] > 12  # Prothrombin time > 12 seconds
    nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] > 2  # Bilirubin > 2 mg/dL

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Survives

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Meaningful Thresholds:**  I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with 12 seconds for `PROTIME` and 2 mg/dL for `BILIRUBIN`. These are still illustrative but closer to potentially meaningful clinical values.  In a real application, these thresholds should be learned from the data.
2. **Feature Names:**  The code now uses the correct feature names from the provided list (e.g., "PROTIME," "BILIRUBIN").  Case sensitivity is crucial.
3. **Target Encoding:** The function returns 0 for "dies" and 1 for "survives," consistent with the provided encoding.
4. **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.
5. **Node List:** The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values of the decision nodes.  If a condition is true, the corresponding element in `nodes` is 1; otherwise, it's 0.


**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    "AGE": 50,
    "SEX": 2,
    "STEROID": 1,
    # ... other features ...
    "BILIRUBIN": 3,
    "PROTIME": 15,
    "HISTOLOGY": 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0=dies, 1=survives)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, because `PROTIME` is > 12 and `BILIRUBIN` is > 2, the prediction will be 0 (dies), and `nodes` will be `[1, 1]`.


**How to use with scikit-learn:**

While the above function demonstrates the logic, to build a robust decision tree from data, use scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # For proper evaluation

# ... (Load your data into X (features) and y (target)) ...

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  # 80% train, 20% test

# Create and train the decision tree
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)  # Set max_depth
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
# ...
```

This approach determines the most important features and their thresholds automatically from the training data and provides tools for evaluating the model's performance. Remember to handle missing data and potentially explore different `max_depth` values to find the best balance between model complexity and performance.
