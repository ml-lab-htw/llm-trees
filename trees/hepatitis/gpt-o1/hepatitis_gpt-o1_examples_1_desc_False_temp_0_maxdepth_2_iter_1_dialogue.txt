**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **PROTIME (Prothrombin Time):**  A normal prothrombin time is typically around 11-13.5 seconds.  We've chosen 12 seconds as the threshold. A longer prothrombin time suggests issues with blood clotting, which can be a serious complication in liver disease and could lead to a higher risk of death.

* **BILIRUBIN:**  Elevated bilirubin levels indicate liver dysfunction.  A bilirubin level above 1.5 mg/dL is often considered abnormal. We've used 1.5 mg/dL as the threshold here. High bilirubin can be a sign of severe liver disease and is associated with poorer outcomes.

**Logic of the Tree (as represented in the function):**

1. **Node 0 (PROTIME):** Checks if the prothrombin time is less than or equal to 12 seconds.
2. **Node 1 (BILIRUBIN):** If the prothrombin time is within the normal range (<= 12), this node checks if bilirubin is also within a normal range (<= 1.5).  If both are normal, the patient is predicted to survive.  If bilirubin is high, even with a normal prothrombin time, the patient is predicted to die.
3. **High PROTIME:** If the prothrombin time is elevated (> 12), regardless of the bilirubin level, the patient is predicted to die. This reflects the assumption that a significantly prolonged prothrombin time is a strong indicator of a poor prognosis.

**Important Note:** These thresholds are chosen for illustrative purposes and are not based on a specific dataset analysis.  In a real-world application, a machine learning model would be trained on data to determine the optimal thresholds for these features, resulting in more accurate and reliable predictions.  It's also crucial to remember that this simplified model may not capture the full complexity of predicting patient survival.  More sophisticated models and more features would likely be needed for clinical decision-making.
