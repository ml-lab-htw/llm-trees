Based on my previous decision tree using prothrombin time as the key predictor, here's the Python function that implements the classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # patient survives
    else:
        prediction = 0  # patient dies
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features
2. Creates a list `nodes` with one element (since the tree has depth 1)
3. Sets the node value based on whether prothrombin time is <= 11.0 seconds
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 (live) if prothrombin time <= 11.0, 0 (die) otherwise
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition (PROTIME <= 11.0)

The threshold of 11.0 seconds is chosen based on clinical significance, as prothrombin times above this level often indicate significant liver dysfunction and higher mortality risk.
