Based on the provided decision tree and feature specifications, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] > 12.5
    nodes[2] = X["ASCITES"] == 1  # 1 = yes
    nodes[3] = X["BILIRUBIN"] > 3.5
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # albumin <= 2.8
        if nodes[1]:  # protime > 12.5
            prediction = 0  # DIE
        else:  # protime <= 12.5
            if nodes[2]:  # ascites = yes
                prediction = 0  # DIE
            else:  # ascites = no
                prediction = 1  # LIVE
    else:  # albumin > 2.8
        if nodes[3]:  # bilirubin > 3.5
            if X["AGE"] > 50:
                prediction = 0  # DIE
            else:
                prediction = 1  # LIVE
        else:  # bilirubin <= 3.5
            prediction = 1  # LIVE
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions at each node
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Albumin: 2.8 g/dL (critical level for liver function)
- Prothrombin time: 12.5 seconds (above normal range)
- Bilirubin: 3.5 mg/dL (significantly elevated)
- Age: 50 years (increased risk threshold)

The decision nodes focus on key clinical indicators that are strong predictors of survival in liver disease.
