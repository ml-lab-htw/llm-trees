Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses BILIRUBIN, ALBUMIN, and PROTIME as the main predictors, with thresholds based on typical medical values. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second decision node: ALBUMIN <= 2.8 or PROTIME <= 12.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5

    # Make prediction (0 = die, 1 = live)
    if nodes[0]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # ALBUMIN <= 2.8
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:  # ALBUMIN > 2.8
            prediction = 1  # live
    else:  # BILIRUBIN > 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # PROTIME <= 12.5
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # PROTIME > 12.5
            prediction = 0  # die

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses BILIRUBIN as the primary split (threshold 3.0 mg/dL, which is significantly above normal)
2. For patients with lower BILIRUBIN, uses ALBUMIN as the secondary split (threshold 2.8 g/dL, where lower values indicate poor liver function)
3. For patients with higher BILIRUBIN, uses PROTIME as the secondary split (threshold 12.5 seconds, where higher values indicate coagulation problems)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the list of boolean values for the decision nodes

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical significance:
- BILIRUBIN > 3
