Based on the provided feature names and encoding, I'll convert the previously discussed decision tree into a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8 if nodes[0] else X["PROTIME"] <= 18.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # bilirubin <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # albumin <= 2.8
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:  # albumin > 2.8
            prediction = 1  # live
    else:  # bilirubin > 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # protime <= 18.0
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # protime > 18.0
            prediction = 0  # die

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with feature names as keys
- Uses the same thresholds as in the previous decision tree
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction (0 for die, 1 for live)
  - list of boolean values for the two decision nodes
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Implements the same logic as the previously discussed tree
- Maintains clinically relevant threshold values
