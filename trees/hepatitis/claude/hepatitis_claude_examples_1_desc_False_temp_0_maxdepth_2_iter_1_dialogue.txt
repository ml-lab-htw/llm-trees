Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using PROTIME, BILIRUBIN, and ALBUMIN as the key predictors. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: PROTIME <= 11.0
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    
    # Second decision node: BILIRUBIN <= 2.0 or ALBUMIN <= 3.0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    # Make prediction (1 = live, 0 = die)
    if nodes[0]:  # PROTIME <= 11.0
        if nodes[1]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 2.0
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # BILIRUBIN > 2.0
            prediction = 0  # die
    else:  # PROTIME > 11.0
        if nodes[1]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.0
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.0
            prediction = 1  # live
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature names as provided in the keys
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = die, 1 = live)
3. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
4. Uses clinically relevant threshold values:
   - PROTIME: 11.0 seconds (normal range is typically 10-13 seconds)
   - BILIRUBIN: 2.0 mg/dL (normal range is typically 0.3-1.2 mg/dL)
   - ALBUMIN: 3.0 g/dL (normal range is typically 3.4-5.4 g/dL)

The decision tree first checks prothrombin time
