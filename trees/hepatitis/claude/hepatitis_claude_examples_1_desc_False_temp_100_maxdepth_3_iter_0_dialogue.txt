I'll create a Python function based on the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts survival (1) or death (0) based on liver disease features.
    Returns prediction and list of boolean values for each decision node.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check albumin level
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second node: Check prothrombin time
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5
    
    # Third node: Check ascites
    nodes[2] = X["ASCITES"] == 1  # 1 = yes, 0 = no
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # PROTIME <= 12.5
            prediction = 1  # survive
        else:  # PROTIME > 12.5
            prediction = 0  # die
    else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.0
        if nodes[2]:  # ASCITES = yes
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:  # ASCITES = no
            prediction = 1  # survive
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided in the dataset
2. Follows the correct encoding for the target variable (0 = die, 1 = live)
3. Uses clinically meaningful thresholds:
   - Albumin <= 3.0 g/dL indicates poor liver function
   - Prothrombin time > 12.5 seconds indicates coagulation problems
   - Ascites is binary (1 = yes, 0 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction and the node decisions as required

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for death, 1 for survival)
2. A list of three boolean values representing the decisions at each node
