Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and target encoding you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['AGE'] <= 50
    nodes[1] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X['ASCITES'] == 0
    nodes[3] = X['ALBUMIN'] <= 3.0
    nodes[4] = X['PROTIME'] <= 12
    nodes[5] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 2.0
    nodes[6] = X['VARICES'] == 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # dies
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # survives
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 1  # survives
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # dies
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # dies
            else:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 1  # survives
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the prediction (1 for survival, 0 for death), and the second element is a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The thresholds and conditions used in this function are based on typical medical values and the encoding provided in your feature descriptions. For example:

- Age threshold of 50 years
- Bilirubin thresholds of 1.5 and 2.0 mg/dL
- Albumin threshol
