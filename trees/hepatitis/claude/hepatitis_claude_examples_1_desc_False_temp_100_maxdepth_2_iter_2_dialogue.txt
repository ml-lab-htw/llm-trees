Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and expected format, I'll convert my decision tree into a Python function. I'll use ALBUMIN and PROTIME as the key features with medically relevant thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5

    if nodes[0]:  # if albumin is low (<=3.0)
        if nodes[1]:  # if protime is normal (<=12.5)
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # if protime is high (>12.5)
            prediction = 0  # die
    else:  # if albumin is normal (>3.0)
        prediction = 1  # live

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing patient features
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes for the two decision points
3. First checks if ALBUMIN is ≤ 3.0 g/dL (node 0)
4. For patients with low albumin, checks if PROTIME is ≤ 12.5 seconds (node 1)
5. Returns a tuple containing:
   - prediction (0 = die, 1 = live)
   - list of boolean values for the decision nodes

The thresholds (3.0 for albumin and 12.5 for prothrombin time) are based on typical clinical reference ranges for liver disease patients.
