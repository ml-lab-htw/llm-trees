Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["AGE"] <= 60
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 2.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree).

2. The first decision is based on the BILIRUBIN level (≤ 3.0 mg/dL).

3. The second decision is based on AGE (≤ 60 years).

4. The third decision is based on ALBUMIN level (> 2.5 g/dL).

5. The function then uses these conditions to determine the prediction:
   - If BILIRUBIN ≤ 3.0 and AGE ≤ 60, the patient survives (1).
   - If BILIRUBIN ≤ 3.0 and AGE > 60, the patient dies (0).
   - If BILIRUBIN > 3.0 and ALBUMIN > 2.5, the patient survives (1).
   - If BILIRUBIN > 3.0 and ALBUMIN ≤ 2.5, the patient dies (0).

6. The function returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the list of node conditions.

This implementation adheres to the specified format and uses the correct feature names and target encoding as provided in the instructions.
