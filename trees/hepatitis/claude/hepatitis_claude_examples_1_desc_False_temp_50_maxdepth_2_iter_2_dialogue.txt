Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using BILIRUBIN, ALBUMIN, and PROTIME as the main features, similar to my previous tree structure but with the correct feature names and appropriate thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on BILIRUBIN
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second level splits
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8 if nodes[0] else X["PROTIME"] <= 16.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # ALBUMIN <= 2.8
            prediction = 0  # Die
        else:  # ALBUMIN > 2.8
            prediction = 1  # Live
    else:  # BILIRUBIN > 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # PROTIME <= 16.0
            prediction = 1  # Live
        else:  # PROTIME > 16.0
            prediction = 0  # Die
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two internal nodes
3. First splits on BILIRUBIN at 3.0 mg/dL (a clinically relevant threshold)
4. For patients with low BILIRUBIN, splits on ALBUMIN at 2.8 g/dL
5. For patients with high BILIRUBIN, splits on PROTIME at 16.0 seconds
6. Returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the node values

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- BILIRUBIN > 3.0 mg/dL indicates significant liver dysfunction
- ALBUMIN â‰¤ 2.8 g/dL indicates poor synthetic liver function
- PROTIME > 16.0 seconds indicates significant coagulopathy
