Based on the provided feature names and their encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the same structure as before but with the correct feature names and medically reasonable threshold values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8 if nodes[0] else X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # ALBUMIN <= 2.8
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:  # ALBUMIN > 2.8
            prediction = 1  # live
    else:  # BILIRUBIN > 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # PROTIME <= 12.5
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # PROTIME > 12.5
            prediction = 0  # die
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature names from the provided list
2. Uses clinically relevant threshold values:
   - Bilirubin: 3.0 mg/dL (elevated levels indicate liver dysfunction)
   - Albumin: 2.8 g/dL (low levels indicate poor liver synthetic function)
   - Protime: 12.5 seconds (prolonged times indicate coagulation problems)
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the list of node conditions
4. Follows the same structure as your example function
