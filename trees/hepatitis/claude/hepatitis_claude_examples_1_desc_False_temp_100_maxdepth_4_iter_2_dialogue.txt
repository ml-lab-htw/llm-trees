Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, but now with proper feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check prothrombin time
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    
    # Second level: Split on albumin and ascites
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] > 3.5
    nodes[2] = X["ASCITES"] == 1  # 1 = yes
    
    # Third level: Check age and bilirubin
    nodes[3] = X["AGE"] <= 50
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # PROTIME <= 11.0
        if nodes[1]:  # ALBUMIN > 3.5
            prediction = 1  # SURVIVES
        else:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.5
            if X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0:
                prediction = 1  # SURVIVES
            else:
                prediction = 0  # DIES
    else:  # PROTIME > 11.0
        if nodes[2]:  # ASCITES = yes
            prediction = 0  # DIES
        else:  # ASCITES = no
            if nodes[3]:  # AGE <= 50
                prediction = 1  # SURVIVES
            else:  # AGE > 50
                prediction = 0  # DIES
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the internal nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions at each node
4. Returns both the final prediction (0 = die, 1 = live) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on clinical knowledge:
- PROTIME: 11.0 seconds (normal range is typically 10-13 seconds)
- ALBUMIN: 3.5 g/dL (lower limit of normal)
