Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that focuses on the most important clinical predictors for liver disease survival:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing binary decisions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (store the binary decision results)
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["ASCITES"] == 1  # 1 = yes
    nodes[2] = X["BILIRUBIN"] > 4.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # ASCITES = yes
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:  # ASCITES = no
            if nodes[2]:  # BILIRUBIN > 4.0
                prediction = 0  # die
            else:
                prediction = 1  # live
    else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.0
        prediction = 1  # live
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = die, 1 = live)
3. Uses clinically meaningful thresholds:
   - Albumin <= 3.0 g/dL (indicating poor liver function)
   - Presence of ascites (binary: 0 = no, 1 = yes)
   - Bilirubin > 4.0 mg/dL (indicating significant liver dysfunction)
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node decisions

The tree primarily focuses on three strong predictors of liver disease mortality:
- Albumin level (key indicator of liver synthetic function)
- Presence of ascites (indicator of advanced liver disease)
- Bilirubin level (marker of liver function)

These thresholds are based on clinical significance in liver disease prognosis.
