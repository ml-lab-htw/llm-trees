Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll convert the decision tree into a Python function. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on medical knowledge:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # We have 7 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # First level
    nodes[0] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 3.0
    
    # Second level
    nodes[1] = X['AGE'] <= 50.0  # For left branch
    nodes[2] = X['PROTIME'] <= 12.0  # For right branch
    
    # Third level
    nodes[3] = X['ALBUMIN'] > 3.5  # For left-left branch
    nodes[4] = X['ASCITES'] == 0  # For left-right branch
    nodes[5] = X['VARICES'] == 0  # For right-right branch
    
    # Making predictions (1 = live, 0 = die)
    if nodes[0]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # AGE <= 50.0
            if nodes[3]:  # ALBUMIN > 3.5
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies
        else:  # AGE > 50.0
            if nodes[4]:  # No ASCITES
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies
    else:  # BILIRUBIN > 3.0
        if nodes[2]:  # PROTIME <= 12.0
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:  # PROTIME > 12.0
            if nodes[5]:  # No VARICES
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies
    
    return prediction, nodes[:6]  # Return prediction and node conditions
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature names as provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = die, 1 = live
