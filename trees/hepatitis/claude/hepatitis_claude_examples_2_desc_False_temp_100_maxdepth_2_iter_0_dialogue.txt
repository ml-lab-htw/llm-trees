Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and target encoding you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X['ALBUMIN'] > 3.5
    nodes[2] = X['ASCITES'] == 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. We create a list `nodes` to store the boolean results of each condition in the decision tree.
3. The first condition checks if bilirubin is <= 2.0 mg/dL.
4. The second condition checks if albumin is > 3.5 g/dL.
5. The third condition checks if ascites is absent (0 = no, 1 = yes).
6. The prediction is made based on these conditions:
   - If bilirubin <= 2.0 and albumin > 3.5, the patient survives (1).
   - If bilirubin <= 2.0 and albumin <= 3.5, the patient dies (0).
   - If bilirubin > 2.0 and no ascites, the patient survives (1).
   - If bilirubin > 2.0 and ascites present, the patient dies (0).
7. The function returns the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the list of node conditions.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the correct feature keys and target encoding as specified in your instructions.
