Based on the provided decision tree and feature descriptions, I'll create a Python function that implements the tree and returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5
    nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # PROTIME <= 12.5
        if nodes[1]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 2.0
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:  # BILIRUBIN > 2.0
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:  # PROTIME > 12.5
        if nodes[2]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.0
            prediction = 0  # dies
        else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.0
            if X["ASCITES"] == 1:  # has ascites
                prediction = 0  # dies
            else:  # no ascites
                prediction = 1  # survives
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the node conditions
3. Evaluates the three main numerical thresholds:
   - PROTIME ≤ 12.5 seconds
   - BILIRUBIN ≤ 2.0 mg/dL
   - ALBUMIN ≤ 3.0 g/dL
4. Uses these conditions along with ASCITES (0 = no, 1 = yes) to determine the prediction
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = die, 1 = live) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are chosen based on typical clinical values:
- PROTIME: 12.5 seconds is slightly above normal range
- BILIRUBIN: 2.0 mg/dL is
