Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and target encoding, here's the Python function that predicts whether a patient survives or dies:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["AGE"] <= 50
    nodes[2] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # dies
        else:
            prediction = 1  # survives
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
2. It evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Is bilirubin <= 2.0 mg/dL?
   - Node 1: Is age <= 50 years?
   - Node 2: Is albumin level <= 3.0 g/dL?
3. Based on these conditions, it predicts whether the patient survives (1) or dies (0).
4. It returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used (2.0 for bilirubin, 50 for age, and 3.0 for albumin) are based on common medical knowledge and the ranges typically seen in liver disease patients. However, these values should ideally be determined through statistical analysis of a specific dataset for optimal accuracy.

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, as requested, and uses what are likely to be the most important features for predicting survival in patients with liver disease.
