Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and target encoding you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['AGE'] <= 50
    nodes[1] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X['ASCITES'] == 0
    nodes[3] = X['ALBUMIN'] <= 3.0
    nodes[4] = X['PROTIME'] <= 12
    nodes[5] = X['VARICES'] == 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # dies
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # survives
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 1 for survival, 0 for death
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the following thresholds and conditions:
- Age threshold: 50 years
- Bilirubin threshold: 1.5 mg/dL
- Albumin threshold: 3.0 g/dL
- Prothrombin time threshold: 12 seconds
- ASCITES and VARICES are considered as binary features (0 for no, 1 for yes)

Please note that this decision tree is a simplified model based on the hypothetical importance of features. In a real-world scenario, the tree structure and thresholds would be determined through rigorous statistical analysis of a large dataset.
