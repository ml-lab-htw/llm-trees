Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and medical knowledge, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree that uses PROTIME and ALBUMIN as the main decision nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:
            prediction = 1  # live
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # die
        else:
            prediction = 1  # live
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Uses PROTIME (prothrombin time) with a threshold of 11.0 seconds as the first decision node
2. Uses ALBUMIN (albumin level) with a threshold of 3.0 g/dL as the second decision node
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
4. The thresholds are based on typical clinical values where:
   - Normal prothrombin time is typically 10-12 seconds
   - Normal albumin levels are typically 3.5-5.0 g/dL
5. Follows the provided encoding where 0 = die and 1 = live
