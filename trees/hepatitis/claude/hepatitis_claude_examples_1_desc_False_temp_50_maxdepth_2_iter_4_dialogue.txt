Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using ALBUMIN, PROTIME, and BILIRUBIN as the main features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on ALBUMIN
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second split on left branch (PROTIME)
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5
    
    # Second split on right branch (BILIRUBIN)
    nodes[2] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 2.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ALBUMIN <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # PROTIME <= 12.5
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:  # PROTIME > 12.5
            prediction = 0  # Dies
    else:  # ALBUMIN > 3.0
        if nodes[2]:  # BILIRUBIN <= 2.0
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:  # BILIRUBIN > 2.0
            prediction = 0  # Dies
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature names as provided in the keys
2. Maintains the target encoding (0 = die, 1 = live)
3. Uses clinically relevant threshold values:
   - ALBUMIN threshold of 3.0 g/dL (below this indicates poor liver function)
   - PROTIME threshold of 12.5 seconds (above this indicates coagulation problems)
   - BILIRUBIN threshold of 2.0 mg/dL (above this indicates liver dysfunction)
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions
5. The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0)
