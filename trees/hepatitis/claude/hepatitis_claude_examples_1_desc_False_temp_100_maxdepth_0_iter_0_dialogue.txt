Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and value ranges, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [
        X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5,
        X["ASCITES"] == 0,
        X["ALBUMIN"] > 2.8
    ]

    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives
    elif not nodes[0] and nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Dies

    return prediction, nodes


```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses the exact feature names provided
3. Uses realistic threshold values based on medical knowledge:
   - ALBUMIN threshold of 2.8 g/dL (low albumin is critical)
   - PROTIME threshold of 12.5 seconds (elevated is concerning)
   - AGE threshold of 70 years (increased risk
