Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes based on the tree structure
    nodes[0] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 2.8
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] > 12.5
    nodes[2] = X["ASCITES"] == 1  # yes = 1
    nodes[3] = X["BILIRUBIN"] > 3.5
    nodes[4] = X["AGE"] > 50

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # albumin <= 2.8
        if nodes[1]:  # protime > 12.5
            prediction = 0  # DIE
        else:  # protime <= 12.5
            if nodes[2]:  # ascites = yes
                prediction = 0  # DIE
            else:  # ascites = no
                prediction = 1  # LIVE
    else:  # albumin > 2.8
        if nodes[3]:  # bilirubin > 3.5
            if nodes[4]:  # age > 50
                prediction = 0  # DIE
            else:  # age <= 50
                prediction = 1  # LIVE
        else:  # bilirubin <= 3.5
            prediction = 1  # LIVE

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of each decision node
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result
4. Uses nested if-else statements to traverse the tree
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for die, 1 for live) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are clinically relevant:
- Albumin <= 2.8 g/dL indicates severe liver dysfunction
- Prothrombin time > 12.5 seconds suggests coagulation problems
- Ascites presence is a serious complication
- Bilirubin > 3.5
