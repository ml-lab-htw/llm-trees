Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses PROTIME, ALBUMIN, and BILIRUBIN as the main predictors, with clinically relevant thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: PROTIME <= 11.0
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    
    # Second decision node: ALBUMIN <= 3.0 or BILIRUBIN <= 3.0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ALBUMIN"] <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Dies
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = die, 1 = live)
- Returns a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
- Uses clinically relevant thresholds:
  - PROTIME: 11.0 seconds (normal range is typically 10-13 seconds)
  - ALBUMIN: 3.0 g/dL (normal range is typically 3.4-5.4 g/dL)
  - BILIRUBIN: 3.0 mg/dL (normal range is typically 0.3-1.2 mg/dL)

The tree first checks if prothrombin time is normal or near-normal (â‰¤11.0 seconds). For patients with normal prothrombin time, it then checks albumin levels. For patients with elevated prothrombin time, it checks bilirubin levels to make the final prediction.
