Based on the provided information and the decision tree I created earlier, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X['AGE'] <= 50
    nodes[2] = X['ALBUMIN'] > 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # survives
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. The first condition checks if BILIRUBIN is <= 3.0 mg/dL.
4. If BILIRUBIN is <= 3.0, we then check if AGE is <= 50 years.
5. If BILIRUBIN is > 3.0, we check if ALBUMIN is > 3.0 g/dL.
6. The prediction is 1 (survives) if:
   - BILIRUBIN <= 3.0 and AGE <= 50, or
   - BILIRUBIN > 3.0 and ALBUMIN > 3.0
7. Otherwise, the prediction is 0 (dies).
8. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names provided and the correct target encoding (0 for die, 1 for live). The thresholds for BILIRUBIN, AGE, and ALBUMIN are set to meaningful values based on medical knowledge and typical ranges for these measurements in liver disease patients.
