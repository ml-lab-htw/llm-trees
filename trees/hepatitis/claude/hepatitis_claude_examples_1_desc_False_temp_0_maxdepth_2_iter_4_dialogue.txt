Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses BILIRUBIN and PROTIME as the main predictors, with appropriate thresholds based on medical knowledge. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # bilirubin <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # protime <= 11.0
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # protime > 11.0
            prediction = 0  # die
    else:  # bilirubin > 3.5
        prediction = 0  # die

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
2. First node checks if BILIRUBIN is <= 3.5 mg/dL (normal to moderately elevated)
3. Second node checks if PROTIME is <= 11.0 seconds (normal range)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 (live) if BILIRUBIN is low and PROTIME is normal
   - prediction: 0 (die) if either BILIRUBIN is high or PROTIME is elevated
   - nodes: list containing the boolean results of each condition

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical significance:
- BILIRUBIN: 3.5 mg/dL is a clinically relevant threshold indicating significant liver dysfunction
- PROTIME: 11.0 seconds represents the upper limit of normal prothrombin time
