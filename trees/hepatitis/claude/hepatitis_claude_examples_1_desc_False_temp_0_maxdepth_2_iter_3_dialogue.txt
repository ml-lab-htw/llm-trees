Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using BILIRUBIN and PROTIME as the main features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BILIRUBIN"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["PROTIME"] <= 11.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # bilirubin <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # protime <= 11.0
            prediction = 1  # live
        else:  # protime > 11.0
            prediction = 0  # die
    else:  # bilirubin > 3.5
        prediction = 0  # die

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
2. First node checks if BILIRUBIN is <= 3.5 mg/dL
3. Second node checks if PROTIME is <= 11.0 seconds
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 (live) if BILIRUBIN <= 3.5 and PROTIME <= 11.0
   - prediction: 0 (die) in all other cases
   - nodes: list containing the boolean values of both conditions

The thresholds (3.5 for BILIRUBIN and 11.0 for PROTIME) are clinically relevant values:
- BILIRUBIN > 3.5 mg/dL indicates significant liver dysfunction
- PROTIME > 11.0 seconds suggests impaired blood clotting ability, which is often associated with poor liver function
