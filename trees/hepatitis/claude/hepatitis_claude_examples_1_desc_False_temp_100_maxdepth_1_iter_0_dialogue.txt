Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function using PROTIME (prothrombin time) as the splitting feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["PROTIME"] <= 12.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # patient lives (PROTIME <= 12.5)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # patient dies (PROTIME > 12.5)
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing patient features
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (since depth=1)
3. Evaluates if PROTIME <= 12.5 seconds and stores this boolean result in nodes[0]
4. Predicts:
   - 1 (live) if PROTIME <= 12.5 seconds
   - 0 (die) if PROTIME > 12.5 seconds
5. Returns both the prediction and the nodes list

The threshold of 12.5 seconds is clinically meaningful because:
- Normal prothrombin time is typically 11-13.5 seconds
- Values above 12.5 seconds suggest impaired liver function and coagulation
- Higher values are associated with increased mortality risk
