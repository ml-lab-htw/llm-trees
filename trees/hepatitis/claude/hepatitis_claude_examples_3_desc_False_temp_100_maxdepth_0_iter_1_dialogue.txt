Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and encodings you've provided, I'll create a Python function that predicts whether a patient survives or dies and returns the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['BILIRUBIN'] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X['AGE'] <= 50
    nodes[2] = X['ALBUMIN'] > 3.5
    nodes[3] = X['PROTIME'] <= 12
    nodes[4] = X['ASCITES'] == 0
    nodes[5] = X['PROTIME'] <= 15
    nodes[6] = X['ALBUMIN'] > 3.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # survives
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # dies
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1  # survives
            else:
                prediction = 0  # dies
        else:
            prediction = 0  # dies

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features as input. It returns two things:
1. The prediction: 1 for survival, 0 for death
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the following features:
- BILIRUBIN: bilirubin level in mg/dL
- AGE: age in years
- ALBUMIN: albumin level in g/dL
- PROTIME: prothrombin time in seconds
- ASCITES: presence of ascites (0 = no, 1 = yes)

These thresholds are based on medical knowledge and the ranges provided in your description. However
