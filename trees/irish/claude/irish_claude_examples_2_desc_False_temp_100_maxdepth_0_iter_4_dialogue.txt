Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you provided, here's the Python function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 10
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 0  # female

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for "school leaving certificate not taken" or 1 for "school leaving certificate taken"
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the following thresholds and conditions:

1. Educational level: ≤ 5 (Junior cycle terminal leaver-secondary school or lower)
2. Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test (DVRT) score: ≤ 85
3. Type of school: 2 (vocational)
4. Prestige score for father's occupation: ≤ 10
5. Sex: 0 (female)

These thresholds are based on the information provided and reasonable assumptions about the data. The function follows the structure of the decision tree I created earlier, adapting it to the specific feature encodings you provided.
