Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using Educational_level as the splitting criterion, as it's likely the most predictive feature for whether a student takes the school leaving certificate.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Educational level <= 4 represents students who haven't completed or are in early stages 
    # of junior cycle (values 0-4 in the encoding)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Students with lower educational levels are less likely to take 
        # the school leaving certificate
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Students with higher educational levels are more likely to take 
        # the school leaving certificate
        prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary splitting feature with a threshold of 4
2. If Educational_level <= 4 (up to Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school), predicts 0 (certificate not taken)
3. If Educational_level > 4, predicts 1 (certificate taken)
4. Returns both the prediction and a list containing the truth value of the splitting condition

The threshold of 4 was chosen because:
- Values 0-4 represent lower educational levels (third level and incomplete junior cycle)
- Values 5-10 represent higher educational levels (completed junior cycle and beyond)
- This split should effectively separate students who are likely to take the leaving certificate from those who aren't
