Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # 1 represents secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree with a depth of 2, using the most important features:

1. The root node checks if the Educational_level is less than or equal to 5.
2. For Educational_level <= 5, it checks if the Type_school is secondary (encoded as 1).
3. For Educational_level > 5, it checks if the DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score is less than or equal to 70.

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for certificate not taken, 1 for certificate taken)
2. A list of three boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This implementation adheres to the feature keys and encodings provided, and uses meaningful thresholds based on the given information.
