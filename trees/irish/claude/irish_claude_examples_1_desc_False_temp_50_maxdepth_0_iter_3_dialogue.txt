Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes their school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second split on DVRT score
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third split on Type_school
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Educational_level <= 4 (Junior cycle incomplete or lower)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If Educational_level > 4
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT <= 85
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Type_school is vocational
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # If Type_school is secondary or primary
                prediction = 1
        else:
            # If DVRT > 85
            prediction = 1
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in our tree
2. First checks if the educational level is lower than or equal to 4 (Junior cycle incomplete or lower)
3. Then checks if the DVRT score is less than or equal to 85
4. Finally checks if the school type is vocational (2)

The prediction logic follows that:
- Students with low educational levels (≤4) won't take the certificate (0)
- Students with higher educational levels but low DVRT scores (≤85) and in vocational schools won't take the certificate (0)
- Students with higher educational levels and either high DVRT scores (>85) or in secondary schools will take the certificate (1)

The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node in the tree.
