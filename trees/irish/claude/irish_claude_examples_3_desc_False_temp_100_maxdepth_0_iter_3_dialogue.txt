Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and encodings you provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 0  # female

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for "not taken" or 1 for "taken")
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree uses the following thresholds and conditions:

1. Educational level <= 5 (corresponding to Junior cycle terminal leaver or lower)
2. DVRT score <= 70
3. Type of school == 2 (vocational)
4. Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
5. Sex == 0 (female)

These thresholds and conditions are based on the feature descriptions and encodings you provided. The tree structure follows the logic of the decision tree I described earlier, adapted to the specific feature encodings and target variable encoding you specified.
