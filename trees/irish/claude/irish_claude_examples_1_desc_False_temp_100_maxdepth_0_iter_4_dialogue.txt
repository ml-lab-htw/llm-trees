Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary terminal leaver and below
    
    # Second split on DVRT (Drumcondra Test Score)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third split on Type_school
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational school
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

The logic of this decision tree is:
1. First checks if the educational level is low (â‰¤ 7, which includes primary terminal leavers and below)
2. For higher educational levels, it checks the Drumcondra Test Score (threshold at 85)
3. For moderate test scores, it considers the type of school (vocational vs. others)

The thresholds were chosen based on these considerations:
- Educational_level threshold of 7 separates primary terminal leavers and below from secondary and vocational school students
- DVRT score of 85 represents a moderately high score that might indicate academic capability
- Type_school check specifically identifies vocational school students (coded as 2)

This tree predicts:
- 0 (no certificate) for students with low educational levels
- 0 (no certificate) for students in vocational schools with moderate test scores
- 1 (certificate) for students with high test scores or those in secondary schools with moderate scores
- 1 (certificate) for students with high educational levels and high test scores
