Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the information you've provided, here's the Python function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (since our tree has a depth of 2) to store the boolean results of each decision node.

3. The first decision is based on the "Educational_level". We use 5 as the threshold, which corresponds to "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school" in the provided encoding.

4. The second decision is based on the "DVRT" (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score. We use 85 as a threshold, which is a reasonable score to differentiate between lower and higher performers.

5. The prediction is made based on these two features:
   - If Educational_level is <= 5 and DVRT score is <= 85, predict 0 (certificate not taken)
   - If Educational_level is <= 5 but DVRT score is > 85, predict 1 (certificate taken)
   - If Educational_level is > 5, predict 1 (certificate taken) regardless of DVRT score

6. The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node results.

This function aligns with the decision tree structure I proposed earlier and uses the exact feature names you provided. It also adheres to the target variable encoding where 0 means the certificate is not taken, and 1 means it is taken.
