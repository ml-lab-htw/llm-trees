I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: Educational level check
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second level: DVRT score check
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third level: School type check
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    # Fourth level: Prestige score check
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 12
    
    # Fifth level: Sex check
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 0  # 0 = female

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Evaluates each node condition using the proper feature names and encodings
4. Returns both the final prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds and conditions are based on meaningful values:
- Educational_level <= 4 (separates early leavers from those who completed more education)
- DVRT <= 85 (represents a below-average test score)
- Type_school == 2 (checks if the school is vocational)
- Prestige_score <= 12 (represents a lower-middle prestige occupation)
- Sex == 0
