Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85 if nodes[0] else X["Type_school"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the educational level is less than or equal to 5 (which corresponds to "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school" or lower).

4. The second node depends on the result of the first node:
   - If educational level <= 5, we check if the DVRT score is <= 85
   - If educational level > 5, we check if the school type is secondary (encoded as 1)

5. Based on these conditions, we make the prediction:
   - 0 means the school leaving certificate is not taken
   - 1 means the school leaving certificate is taken

6. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation maintains a maximum depth of 2 and uses the most important features as determined in the original decision tree. It also adheres to the specific feature keys and encodings provided.
