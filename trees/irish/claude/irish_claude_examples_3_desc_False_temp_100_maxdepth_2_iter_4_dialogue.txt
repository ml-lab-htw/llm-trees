Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as we have 2 inner nodes in our depth-2 tree).
3. The first node checks if the Educational_level is <= 5.
4. The second node checks if the DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score is <= 85.
5. Based on these conditions, we make the prediction:
   - If Educational_level <= 5, predict 0 (certificate not taken)
   - If Educational_level > 5 and DVRT <= 85, predict 0 (certificate not taken)
   - If Educational_level > 5 and DVRT > 85, predict 1 (certificate taken)
6. The function returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values.

This function uses the feature names exactly as provided in the keys list, and the target variable is encoded as 0 for "not taken" and 1 for "taken", as specified. The thresholds (5 for Educational_level and 85 for DVRT) are based on meaningful values that could separate the classes effectively.
