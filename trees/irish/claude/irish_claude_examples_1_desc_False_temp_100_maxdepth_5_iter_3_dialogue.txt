Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational school
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary school

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Certificate
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Certificate
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Follows the proper encoding for both features and target variable
3. Includes meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the most important features: Educational_level, DVRT (test score), Type_school, and Prestige_score
6. Maintains a maximum depth of 5

The thresholds chosen are based on:
- Educational_level <= 4 (separating lower educational levels)
- DVRT <= 85 (middle range for test scores)
- Type_school checks for vocational (2) and secondary (1) schools
-
