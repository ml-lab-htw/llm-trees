Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 represents vocational school
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in our tree
2. Uses the actual feature encodings provided:
   - Educational_level <= 4 checks if the student is at Junior cycle incomplete or lower
   - DVRT <= 85 represents a threshold for the verbal reasoning test
   - Type_school == 2 checks if the student is in vocational school
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for no certificate, 1 for certificate) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree makes predictions based on:
- Educational level as the primary split
- DVRT score as the secondary split for those with higher educational levels
- School type as the final split for those with lower DVRT scores

Each node in the returned list will be True (1) or False (0) depending on whether the corresponding condition was met for the input features.
