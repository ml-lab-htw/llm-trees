Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 80
    nodes[3] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[4] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 14
    nodes[5] = X["Sex"] == 1  # male

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No certificate
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for "not taken" or 1 for "taken")
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree uses the following features and thresholds:

1. Educational level (≤ 5 or > 5)
2. Type of school (primary terminal leaver, secondary terminal leaver, or vocational)
3. Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (≤ 80 or > 80)
4. Prestige score for father's occupation (≤ 14 or > 14)
5. Sex (male or female)

The function follows the structure of the decision tree, checking conditions at each node and making a prediction based on the path taken through the tree.
