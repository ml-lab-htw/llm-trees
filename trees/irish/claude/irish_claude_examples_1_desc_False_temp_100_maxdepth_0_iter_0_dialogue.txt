Based on the provided features and their encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes their school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Educational level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second decision node: DVRT (Drumcondra Test Score)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third decision node: Type of school
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Educational_level <= 4 (Junior cycle incomplete or lower)
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        # If Educational_level > 4
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT <= 85
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Type_school is vocational
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                # If Type_school is secondary or primary
                prediction = 1  # Take Certificate
        else:
            # If DVRT > 85
            prediction = 1  # Take Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the educational level is less than or equal to 4 (Junior cycle incomplete or lower)
2. For students with higher educational levels, it checks their Drumcondra Test Score
3. For students with lower test scores, it considers the type of school they attend

The thresholds chosen are:
- Educational_level: 4 (splitting between Junior cycle incomplete and higher levels)
- DVRT: 85 (representing a moderately high test score)
- Type_school: checks specifically for vocational schools (encoded as 2)

The function returns both:
1. The prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
2. A list of three boolean values representing whether each condition in the decision nodes was met
