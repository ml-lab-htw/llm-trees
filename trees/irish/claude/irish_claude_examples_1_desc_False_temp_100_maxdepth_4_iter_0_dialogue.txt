Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 internal nodes in our tree
    
    # First split on Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary terminal leaver or lower
    
    # Second split on DVRT (Drumcondra Test Score)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third split on Type_school
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational school
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
3. Makes decisions based on:
   - Educational level (threshold at Primary terminal leaver)
   - DVRT score (threshold at 85)
   - Type of school (specifically checking for vocational school)
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on:
- Educational_level: 7 corresponds to Primary_terminal_leaver
- DVRT: 85 represents a moderate test score
- Type_school: 2 represents vocational school according to the provided encoding

The function follows the same logic as the decision tree diagram provided earlier, but now with specific threshold values and proper feature encodings.
