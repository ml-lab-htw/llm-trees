Based on the information provided and the decision tree structure I proposed earlier, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 10
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 0  # female

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for certificate not taken, 1 for certificate taken)
2. A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 if not, None if not evaluated)

The decision tree is based on the following logic:
1. First, it checks if the educational level is 5 or lower.
2. If the educational level is higher than 5, it checks the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score.
3. For lower test scores, it considers the type of school.
4. For higher test scores, it looks at the father's occupation prestige score.
5. In some cases, it also considers the student's sex.

Note that I've used meaningful thresholds based on the provided information and made some assumptions where specific values weren't given. You may need to adjust these thresholds based on your actual data
