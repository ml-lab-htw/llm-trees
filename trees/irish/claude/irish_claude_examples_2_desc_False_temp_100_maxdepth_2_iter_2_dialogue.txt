Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier and the additional information you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 80

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["Type_school"] == 1:  # secondary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as our tree has a depth of 2) to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the Educational_level is less than or equal to 5. This corresponds to Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school or lower in the educational level encoding.

4. The second node checks if the DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score is less than or equal to 80. This threshold is chosen as a reasonable middle value, assuming the test scores range from 0 to 100.

5. If the Educational_level is <= 5, we then check the Type_school. If it's secondary (encoded as 1), we predict the certificate is taken (1). Otherwise, we predict it's not taken (0).

6. If the Educational_level is > 5, we then look at the DVRT score. If it's <= 80, we predict the certificate is not taken (0). If it's > 80, we predict it is taken (1).

7. The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys you provided and adhering to the target value encoding (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
