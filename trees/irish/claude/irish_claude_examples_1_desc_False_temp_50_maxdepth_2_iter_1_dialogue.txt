Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using Educational_level and DVRT as the main features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Educational level
    # Split between Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school (4) and 
    # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school (5)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second decision node: DVRT score
    # Using 85 as a threshold for the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Educational_level is <= 4 (up to Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school)
        prediction = 0  # Not taking certificate
    else:
        # For higher educational levels
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is low
            prediction = 0  # Not taking certificate
        else:
            # If DVRT score is high
            prediction = 1  # Taking certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary split with a threshold of 4 (splitting between Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school and Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school)
2. Uses DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score) as the secondary split with a threshold of 85
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node conditions
4. The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True = 1, False = 0)

The decision logic predicts that a student will take the school leaving certificate (1) only if they have both:
- An Educational_level > 4 (higher educational level)
- A DVRT score > 85 (higher verbal reasoning ability)

In all other cases, it predicts the student will not take the certificate (0).
