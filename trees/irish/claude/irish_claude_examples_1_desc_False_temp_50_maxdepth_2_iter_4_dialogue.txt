I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Educational level
    # We use 7 as threshold (above Primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7
    
    # Second decision node: DVRT score
    # Using 65 as a reasonable threshold for the verbal reasoning test
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 65
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is low (≤ 7)
        prediction = 0  # No certificate
    else:
        # If educational level is higher (> 7)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is low (≤ 65)
            prediction = 0  # No certificate
        else:
            # If DVRT score is high (> 65)
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of each decision node
3. Uses Educational_level as the primary split (threshold 7, separating Primary_terminal_leaver and below from higher levels)
4. Uses DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score) as the secondary split (threshold 65)
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node results

The thresholds were chosen based on the feature descriptions:
- Educational_level threshold of 7 separates Primary_terminal_leaver from higher education levels
- DVRT threshold of 65 represents a moderate-to-high score on the verbal reasoning test
