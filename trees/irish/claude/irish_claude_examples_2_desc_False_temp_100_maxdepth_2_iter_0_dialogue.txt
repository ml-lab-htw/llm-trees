Thank you for providing the detailed information and examples. Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've provided, I'll create a Python function that predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70 if nodes[0] else X["Type_school"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. The first node checks if the Educational_level is <= 5.
4. The second node depends on the result of the first node:
   - If Educational_level <= 5, it checks if DVRT <= 70
   - If Educational_level > 5, it checks if Type_school is secondary (encoded as 1)
5. Based on these conditions, the function predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not taken (0).
6. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This function maintains the structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the most relevant features while keeping a maximum depth of 2. It also adheres to the specific feature keys and encodings you provided.
