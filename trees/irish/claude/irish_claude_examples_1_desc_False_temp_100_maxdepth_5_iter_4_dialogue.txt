Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0), along with the node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the feature encoding provided
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4  # Split on educational level
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Split on Drumcondra test score
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # Is vocational school
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 10  # Split on father's occupation prestige
    nodes[4] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Is secondary school

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Certificate
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Certificate
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the educational level is <= 4 (up to Junior cycle incomplete)
2. Then considers the Drumcondra test score with a threshold of 85
3. Checks the type of school (vocational vs. secondary)
4. Considers father's occupation prestige score
5. Makes final decisions based on school type

The thresholds were chosen based on reasonable assumptions:
- Educational level 4 represents a key transition point
- DVRT score of 85 represents an above-average performance
- Prestige score of 10 represents a middle range in the 0-28
