I'll create a Python function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Three decision nodes in the tree
    
    # Convert the conditions into boolean expressions
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys you provided
2. Creates appropriate thresholds based on the feature descriptions
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and the list of boolean values for each node
4. Uses the correct encoding for Type_school (2 = vocational)
5. Uses Educational_level threshold of 6 (corresponding to "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school")
6. Uses a reasonable DVRT score threshold of 85

The tree makes decisions based on:
- Educational level (≤6 vs >6)
- DVRT score (≤85 vs >85)
- Type of school (vocational vs others)

The nodes list will contain three boolean values corresponding to:
1. Whether Educational_level ≤ 6
2. Whether DVRT ≤ 85
3. Whether Type_school is vocational (2)
