Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # 1 represents secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 75

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (for a depth-2 tree, we need 3 nodes: 1 root and 2 internal nodes).

3. The first node checks if the educational level is <= 5 (which includes Junior cycle and below).

4. The second node checks if the school type is secondary (encoded as 1).

5. The third node checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is <= 75.

6. The prediction logic follows the decision tree structure:
   - If educational level is <= 5:
     - If it's a secondary school, predict certificate taken (1)
     - Otherwise, predict certificate not taken (0)
   - If educational level is > 5:
     - If DVRT score is <= 75, predict certificate not taken (0)
     - Otherwise, predict certificate taken (1)

7. The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node conditions (True/False).

This implementation respects the feature encodings and target variable encoding provided, and follows the structure of the decision tree classifier I proposed earlier.
