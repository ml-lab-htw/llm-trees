Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First level decision
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    
    # Second level decisions
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 90
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # 1 represents secondary_terminal_leaver
    
    # Make prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree with the following structure:

1. The first decision is based on the Educational_level. If it's 5 or less (which includes Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school and lower levels), it goes to the left branch. Otherwise, it goes to the right branch.

2. For the left branch (Educational_level <= 5):
   - It then checks the DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score.
   - If DVRT <= 90, it predicts the certificate is not taken (0).
   - If DVRT > 90, it predicts the certificate is taken (1).

3. For the right branch (Educational_level > 5):
   - It checks the Type_school.
   - If Type_school is secondary_terminal_leaver (encoded as 1), it predicts the certificate is taken (1).
   - Otherwise, it predicts the certificate is not taken (0).

The function returns both the prediction (0 for not taken, 1 for taken) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note: The thresholds (5 for Educational_level and 90 for DVRT
