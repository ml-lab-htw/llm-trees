Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that classifies whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We need 3 nodes for our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4  # Split between Junior cycle incomplete and terminal leaver
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Threshold for Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # Check if school type is vocational
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the educational level is lower than or equal to 4 (Junior cycle incomplete)
2. For higher educational levels, it checks the DVRT score
3. For lower DVRT scores, it checks the school type
4. Makes predictions based on these conditions:
   - Students with low educational levels (â‰¤4) don't take the certificate
   - Students with higher educational levels and high DVRT scores (>85) take the certificate
   - Students with higher educational levels but lower DVRT scores take the certificate only if they're not in vocational school

The thresholds were chosen based on the feature descriptions and typical educational patterns:
- Educational_level threshold of 4 separates early school leavers from those who continue
- DVRT score of 85 represents a reasonable academic performance threshold
- Type_school check specifically looks for vocational schools (coded as 2)
