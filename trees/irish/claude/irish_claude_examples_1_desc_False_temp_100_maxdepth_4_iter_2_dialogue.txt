Based on the provided features and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and returns the node conditions. I'll adjust the thresholds to meaningful values based on the feature descriptions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing conditions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6  # Split between Junior cycle terminal leaver and higher
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Threshold for Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # Check if school type is vocational
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15  # Middle range of father's occupation prestige
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # DVRT <= 85
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:  # DVRT > 85
            if nodes[2]:  # Type_school is vocational
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:  # Type_school is not vocational
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
    else:  # Educational_level > 6
        if nodes[2]:  # Type_school is vocational
            if nodes[3]:  # Prestige_score <= 15
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:  # Prestige_score > 15
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:  # Type_school is not vocational
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the educational level (â‰¤6 vs >6)
2. For lower educational levels, considers the DVRT score and school type
3. For higher educational levels, considers the school type and father's prestige score
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and the truth values
