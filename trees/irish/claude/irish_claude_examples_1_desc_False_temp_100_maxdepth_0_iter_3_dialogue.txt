Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 4  # Split between early leavers and those who continued
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 85  # Split on verbal reasoning test score
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Check if student is in secondary school
    
    # Tree traversal
    if not nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 4
        prediction = 0  # No certificate
    else:  # Educational_level > 4
        if not nodes[1]:  # DVRT <= 85
            if nodes[2]:  # Type_school == secondary
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
            else:  # Type_school == vocational or primary
                prediction = 0  # No certificate
        else:  # DVRT > 85
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a list for 3 decision nodes

2. The decision nodes check:
   - If Educational_level is > 4 (distinguishing between early school leavers and those who continued)
   - If DVRT score is > 85 (splitting on academic ability)
   - If the school type is secondary (1)

3. Makes predictions based on these conditions:
   - Predicts 0 (no certificate) for students with low educational levels
   - For higher educational levels:
     - With lower DVRT scores, only secondary school students get certificates
     - With higher DVRT scores, predicts certificate completion

4. Returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node conditions (True/False)

This tree focuses on the most important features for predicting certificate completion: educational level, academic ability (DVRT), and school type, which are likely to be the strongest predictors of certificate completion
