Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier function that uses Educational_level as the splitting criterion, since it's likely the most important predictor for whether a student takes the school leaving certificate.

The threshold value would logically be around 7, as this separates primary terminal leavers and below from those who continued to senior cycle education.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
    else:
        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate taken
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (since we have a depth-1 tree)
3. Checks if Educational_level is <= 7 (threshold separating primary terminal leavers and below from senior cycle students)
4. Returns 0 (certificate not taken) if Educational_level <= 7, and 1 (certificate taken) otherwise
5. Also returns the list of node truth values

The logic behind this threshold is:
- Educational levels 0-7 (primary terminal leaver and below) are less likely to have taken the leaving certificate
- Educational levels 8-10 (senior cycle and above) are more likely to have taken the leaving certificate
