Based on the provided features and their encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and returns the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the 3 conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary terminal leaver and below
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Threshold for Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Check if secondary school
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. First checks if the educational level is at or below primary terminal leaver (â‰¤ 7)
2. Then checks if the DVRT score is below or equal to 85
3. Finally checks if the student is in a secondary school (Type_school == 1)

The thresholds are chosen based on the feature descriptions and reasonable assumptions:
- Educational_level threshold of 7 separates primary terminal leavers and below from higher levels
- DVRT score of 85 represents a reasonable threshold for academic performance
- Type_school == 1 specifically identifies secondary school students

The function returns both:
1. The prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
2. A list of three boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

This matches the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier while using the correct feature names and encodings from your specifications.
