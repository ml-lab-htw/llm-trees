Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses Educational_level and DVRT as the main predictors, with appropriate thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Educational level
    # Split between Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school (4) and 
    # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school (5)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second decision node: DVRT score (typical standardized test threshold)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is low (â‰¤ 4)
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    else:
        # If educational level is higher (> 4)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is low
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            # If DVRT score is high
            prediction = 1  # Taken
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary split with a threshold of 4 (between Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school and Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school)
2. Uses DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score) as the secondary split with a threshold of 85
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node decisions
4. The nodes list contains boolean values (converted to 0/1) indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds were chosen based on:
- Educational_level: The split at 4 separates lower secondary education from upper secondary education
- DVRT: 85 represents a moderately high score on a standardized test (assuming a typical standardized test scale)
