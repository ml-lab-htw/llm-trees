I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary_terminal_leaver or lower
    
    # Second split on DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower educational level
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    else:  # Higher educational level
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower DVRT score
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # Higher DVRT score
            prediction = 1  # Taken
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary split with a threshold of 7 (Primary_terminal_leaver or lower)
2. Uses DVRT as the secondary split with a threshold of 85
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node conditions
4. The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True = 1, False = 0)

The thresholds were chosen based on the feature descriptions:
- Educational_level threshold of 7 separates Primary_terminal_leaver and lower levels from higher levels
- DVRT threshold of 85 represents a moderate score on the verbal reasoning test

The decision rules are:
- If Educational_level ≤ 7: predict "not taken" (0)
- If Educational_level > 7:
  - If DVRT ≤ 85: predict "not taken" (0)
  - If DVRT > 85: predict "taken" (1)
