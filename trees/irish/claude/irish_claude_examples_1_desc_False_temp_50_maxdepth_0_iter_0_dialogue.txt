Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4  # Split between Junior cycle incomplete and terminal leaver
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Threshold for Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Check if school type is secondary
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is low (≤ 4)
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        # If educational level is higher (> 4)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is low (≤ 85)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If secondary school
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
            else:
                # If not secondary school
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:
            # If DVRT score is high (> 85)
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses three key decision nodes based on Educational_level, DVRT score, and Type_school
2. First checks if the educational level is low (≤ 4, corresponding to Junior cycle incomplete or lower)
3. For higher educational levels, considers the DVRT score with a threshold of 85
4. For lower DVRT scores, considers the type of school (secondary vs. others)
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = no certificate, 1 = certificate) and the list of boolean values for each node condition

The thresholds were chosen based on the feature descriptions and logical assumptions about educational progression:
- Educational_level threshold of 4 separates Junior cycle incomplete from terminal leavers
- DVRT score of 85 represents a moderate achievement level
- Type_school check
