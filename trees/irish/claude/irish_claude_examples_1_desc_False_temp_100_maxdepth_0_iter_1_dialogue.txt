Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature specifications, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Take Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Take Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in the tree
3. Sets logical conditions for each node:
   - First split on Educational_level (≤4)
   - Second split on DVRT score (≤70)
   - Third split on Type_school (whether it's vocational or not)
4. Returns both:
   - The prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
   - The list of boolean values for each node condition

The thresholds were chosen based on the feature descriptions:
- Educational_level ≤ 4 captures students up to Junior cycle incomplete
- DVRT score of 70 represents a moderate achievement level
- Type_school == 2 identifies vocational school students

This implementation aligns with the original decision tree structure while using the exact feature names and encodings provided.
