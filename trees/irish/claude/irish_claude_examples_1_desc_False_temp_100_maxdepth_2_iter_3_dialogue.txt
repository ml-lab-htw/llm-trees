Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, adjusting the thresholds to match the actual value ranges:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # First node checks Educational_level (using 7 as threshold since values above are senior cycle levels)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7
    # Second node checks DVRT score (using 85 as a reasonable threshold for the verbal reasoning test)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of node conditions
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions:
  - Educational_level <= 7 separates primary/junior cycle from senior cycle levels
  - DVRT <= 85 represents a reasonable threshold for the verbal reasoning test score
- Follows the same structure as the example function provided
- Returns predictions matching the specified encoding (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
