Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature details, here's the Python function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, along with the list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1  # male
    nodes[5] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
            elif nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken (primary_terminal_leaver)
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values as input and returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for certificate not taken, 1 for certificate taken) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

The thresholds and conditions in the function are based on the decision tree structure I provided earlier, with some adjustments to match the given feature encodings:

1. Educational level threshold is set to 5, which corresponds to "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school".
2. DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score threshold is set to 70, which seems like a reasonable middle value for a test score.
3. Type of school is checked for secondary (1) and vocational (
