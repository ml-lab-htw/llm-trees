Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes their school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational school
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate for low educational level
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower test scores
            if nodes[2]:  # Vocational school
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:  # Secondary school
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:  # Higher test scores
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to our three decision points:
   - Educational level threshold
   - DVRT (Drumcondra Test) score threshold
   - School type check

2. Uses the actual feature encodings provided:
   - Educational_level: uses the 0-10 scale
   - Type_school: uses 2 for vocational school
   - DVRT: uses raw score with threshold at 85

3. Returns both:
   - The prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
   - The list of boolean values for each decision node

The thresholds were chosen based on logical splits in the data:
- Educational_level <= 4 captures students with incomplete junior cycle education
- DVRT score of 85 represents a reasonable academic performance threshold
- Type_school check specifically identifies vocational school students

This tree prioritizes educational level as the primary predictor, followed by test scores and school type, which aligns with likely real-world patterns in educational achievement.
