Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and returns the node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 internal nodes in our tree
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 7  # Split between lower and higher educational levels
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 45  # Split on Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Check if it's secondary school
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if not nodes[0]:
        # Educational_level <= 7 (Primary or junior cycle)
        prediction = 0  # No certificate
    else:
        # Educational_level > 7 (Senior cycle)
        if not nodes[1]:
            # Lower DVRT score
            if nodes[2]:
                # Secondary school
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
            else:
                # Vocational or primary
                prediction = 0  # No certificate
        else:
            # Higher DVRT score
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. First checks the educational level (most important split)
2. For higher educational levels, looks at the DVRT score
3. For lower DVRT scores, considers the school type

The thresholds are chosen based on meaningful values:
- Educational_level > 7 separates senior cycle students from others
- DVRT > 45 represents an above-average score
- Type_school == 1 identifies secondary school students

The prediction is binary (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken), and the function returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the condition states at each internal node.
