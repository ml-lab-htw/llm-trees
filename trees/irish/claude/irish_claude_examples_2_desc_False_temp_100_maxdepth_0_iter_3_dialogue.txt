Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1  # male

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 5 elements, corresponding to the conditions in the decision tree.

3. Each node is evaluated based on the feature values in `X`:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the educational level is 5 or lower.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is 70 or lower.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the school type is secondary (encoded as 1).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the father's occupation prestige score is 15 or lower.
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the student is male (encoded as 1).

4. The prediction is made by following the decision tree structure:
   - If the educational level is 5 or lower, predict no certificate (0).
