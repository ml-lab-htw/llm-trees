I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature keys and encodings provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary_terminal_leaver or lower
    
    # Second split on DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower educational level
        prediction = 0  # Not taking certificate
    else:  # Higher educational level
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower DVRT score
            prediction = 0  # Not taking certificate
        else:  # Higher DVRT score
            prediction = 1  # Taking certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary split with a threshold of 7 (Primary_terminal_leaver or lower vs. higher levels)
2. Uses DVRT as the secondary split with a threshold of 85
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the list of boolean values for the inner nodes
4. Uses the exact feature keys as provided
5. Follows the encoding where 0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken

The thresholds were chosen based on:
- Educational_level: 7 corresponds to Primary_terminal_leaver, which is a natural splitting point between lower and higher education levels
- DVRT: 85 represents a moderate score on the verbal reasoning test, serving as a reasonable threshold for academic performance
