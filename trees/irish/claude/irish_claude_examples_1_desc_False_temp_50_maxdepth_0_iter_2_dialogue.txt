Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes their school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4  # First split on educational level
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Second split on DVRT score
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # Check if school type is vocational (2)
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is low (<=4)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If educational level is higher (>4)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is low (<=85)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If school type is vocational
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # If school type is not vocational
                prediction = 1
        else:
            # If DVRT score is high (>85)
            prediction = 1
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in our tree
2. The first node checks if the educational level is <= 4
3. The second node checks if the DVRT score is <= 85
4. The third node checks if the school type is vocational (2)

The prediction logic follows that:
- Students with low educational levels (â‰¤4) don't take the certificate (0)
- Students with higher educational levels and high DVRT scores (>85) take the certificate (1)
- Students with higher educational levels but lower DVRT scores take the certificate (1) only if they're not in vocational school
- Students in vocational school with lower DVRT scores don't take the certificate (0)

The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of boolean values for each node condition.
