Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes their school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second split on DVRT score
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third split on school type
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational school
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is low (<=4)
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        # If educational level is higher (>4)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is low (<=85)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If vocational school
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                # If secondary school
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            # If DVRT score is high (>85)
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in our tree

2. The decision points are:
   - Educational_level <= 4 (distinguishing between lower and higher educational levels)
   - DVRT <= 85 (distinguishing between lower and higher test scores)
   - Type_school == 2 (checking if it's a vocational school)

3. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (certificate not taken) or 1 (certificate taken)
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The thresholds chosen are:
- Educational_level: 4 (splitting between Junior cycle incomplete and higher levels)
- DVRT: 85 (reasonable threshold for test performance)
- Type_school: checking specifically for vocational school (2)

This tree prioritizes educational level as the primary predictor, followed by test scores and school type, which are likely to be
