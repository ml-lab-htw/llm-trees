I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I described earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    
    # Second split on DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Third split on Type_school
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Educational_level is <= 4 (up to Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school)
        prediction = 0  # No certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT score is <= 85
            prediction = 0  # No certificate
        else:
            # If DVRT score is > 85
            if nodes[2]:
                # If secondary school
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
            else:
                # If primary or vocational
                prediction = 0  # No certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys you provided
2. Follows the correct encoding for the target variable (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
3. Uses meaningful thresholds:
   - Educational_level <= 4 captures students up to Junior cycle incomplete in vocational school
   - DVRT <= 85 represents a below-average verbal reasoning score
   - Type_school == 1 identifies secondary school students
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each node's condition
5. Maintains a maximum depth of 3

The function takes a dictionary X containing the feature values and returns a tuple containing:
- The prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
- A list of three boolean values representing whether each node's condition was satisfied
