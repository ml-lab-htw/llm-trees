Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1  # male

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else node for node in nodes]
```

This function implements the decision tree based on the structure we discussed earlier, with some adjustments to match the exact feature names and encodings provided. Here's a breakdown of the decision nodes:

1. First, it checks if the Educational_level is 5 or lower.
2. Then, it checks if the DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score is 85 or lower.
3. It checks if the Type_school is secondary_terminal_leaver (encoded as 1).
4. It checks if the Prestige_score is 15 or lower.
5. Finally, it checks if the Sex is male (encoded as 1).

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction: 1 for "Taken" and 0 for "Not Taken"
2. A list of 5 elements representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 if not, None if not evaluated)
