Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree we discussed earlier, adjusting the thresholds to match the actual feature scales:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on Educational_level (using 7 as threshold since it's between primary and secondary levels)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7
    
    # Second split on DVRT (using 85 as a reasonable threshold for the verbal reasoning test)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is lower (primary level or below)
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    else:
        # For higher educational levels, check DVRT score
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and the list of node conditions
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions:
  - Educational_level <= 7 separates primary terminal leavers from secondary/vocational students
  - DVRT <= 85 represents a reasonable threshold for the verbal reasoning test score
- Follows the same structure as the example provided
- Uses the correct target encoding (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
