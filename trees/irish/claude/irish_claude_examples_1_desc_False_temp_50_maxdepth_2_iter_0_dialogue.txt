Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using Educational_level and DVRT as the main features, with appropriate thresholds based on the feature descriptions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Educational_level <= 7 (Primary_terminal_leaver or lower)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7
    
    # Second node: DVRT <= 85
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If educational level is Primary_terminal_leaver or lower
        prediction = 0  # Not taking certificate
    else:
        # For higher educational levels
        if nodes[1]:
            # Lower DVRT scores
            prediction = 0  # Not taking certificate
        else:
            # Higher DVRT scores
            prediction = 1  # Taking certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary split with a threshold of 7 (Primary_terminal_leaver)
2. Uses DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score) as the secondary split with a threshold of 85
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken) and the node conditions
4. Follows the exact feature names provided
5. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions
6. Returns predictions aligned with the target encoding (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)

The thresholds were chosen based on:
- Educational_level: 7 represents Primary_terminal_leaver, which is a natural splitting point
- DVRT: 85 represents a moderate test score threshold
