Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that classifies whether a student takes their school leaving certificate (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary terminal leaver and below
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Threshold for verbal reasoning test
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Is secondary school
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No certificate if educational level is low
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No certificate if DVRT score is low
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate if secondary school
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No certificate otherwise
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the educational level is low (≤ 7, which includes primary terminal leavers and below)
2. Then checks if the DVRT score is low (≤ 85)
3. Finally checks if the student is in a secondary school (Type_school == 1)

The logic follows that:
- Students with low educational levels are unlikely to take the certificate
- For higher educational levels, if the DVRT score is low, they're still unlikely to take the certificate
- For those with higher DVRT scores, being in a secondary school is a positive indicator for taking the certificate

The thresholds were chosen based on reasonable assumptions about the data distributions and the encoding provided.
