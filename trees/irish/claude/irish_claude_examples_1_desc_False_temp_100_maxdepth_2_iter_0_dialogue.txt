Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student takes the school leaving certificate (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) using the DVRT score and Educational_level as main features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Split on DVRT score
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Split on Educational level (Primary_terminal_leaver as threshold)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If DVRT score is low (<=85)
        if nodes[1]:  # If Educational level is low (<=7)
            prediction = 0  # Not likely to take certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Likely to take certificate
    else:  # If DVRT score is high (>85)
        prediction = 1  # Likely to take certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the DVRT score is <= 85 (lower academic ability)
2. For students with lower DVRT scores, it then checks their educational level, using level 7 (Primary_terminal_leaver) as a threshold
3. Predicts that students will take the certificate (1) if they either:
   - Have a high DVRT score (>85)
   - Have a low DVRT score (<=85) but higher educational level (>7)
4. Predicts that students won't take the certificate (0) if they have both:
   - Low DVRT score (<=85)
   - Low educational level (<=7)

The function returns both the prediction and a list of the truth values for each internal node condition.
