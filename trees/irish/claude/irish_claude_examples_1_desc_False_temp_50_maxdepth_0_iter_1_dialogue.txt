Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a student will take the school leaving certificate (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check Educational level (using Senior cycle as threshold)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary terminal leaver or lower
    
    # Node 1: Check DVRT score
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    
    # Node 2: Check school type
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 7
        if nodes[1]:  # DVRT <= 85
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:  # DVRT > 85
            if nodes[2]:  # secondary school
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
            else:  # vocational or primary
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:  # Educational_level > 7
        prediction = 1  # Certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses Educational_level as the primary split (threshold at 7, separating primary terminal leavers and below from higher levels)
2. For lower educational levels, considers the DVRT score (threshold at 85)
3. For students with lower educational levels but higher DVRT scores, considers the school type
4. Predicts that students with higher educational levels (above primary terminal leaver) will take the certificate

The function returns:
- A prediction (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
- A list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds were chosen based on the feature descriptions and logical assumptions about the Irish educational system. The DVRT score threshold of 85 represents a moderately high score that might indicate academic capability.
