Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature details, here's the Python function that predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, along with the list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 60
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1  # male

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else node for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the feature values and returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for "not taken" or 1 for "taken") and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

The thresholds and conditions in the decision tree are based on the feature descriptions and encoding provided:

1. Educational_level <= 5 checks if the educational level is Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school or lower.
2. DVRT <= 60 is an arbitrary threshold for the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score, assuming scores range from 0 to 100.
3. Type_school == 1 checks if the school type is secondary_terminal_leaver.
4. Prestige_score <= 15 is a mid-range threshold for the father's occupation prestige score (0 to 28).
5. Sex == 1 checks if the sex is male.

The function evaluates these conditions
