Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in our tree
2. Uses the actual feature encodings provided:
   - Educational_level <= 4 (checking if education level is at Junior cycle incomplete or lower)
   - DVRT score threshold of 85
   - Type_school == 2 (checking if it's vocational school)
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for no certificate, 1 for certificate taken) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree makes predictions based on:
- First checking if the educational level is low (≤4)
- Then checking the DVRT score (≤85)
- Finally checking the school type (vocational vs others)

Each node in the returned list will be True (1) or False (0) depending on whether the corresponding condition was met for the input features.
