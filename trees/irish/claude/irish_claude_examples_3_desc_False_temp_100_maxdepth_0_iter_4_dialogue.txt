Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 0  # female

    if not nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No certificate taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names as specified in the provided list. The function returns two values:

1. `prediction`: 0 if the school leaving certificate is not taken, 1 if it is taken.
2. `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

The decision tree uses the following thresholds and conditions:

1. Educational level > 5 (Junior cycle terminal leaver or higher)
2. DVRT score <= 70
3. Type of school is vocational (2)
4. Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
5. Sex is female (0)

These thresholds and conditions are based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding. The tree structure follows the logic described in the earlier decision tree, with some adjustments to fit the exact feature encodings and target variable encoding provided.
