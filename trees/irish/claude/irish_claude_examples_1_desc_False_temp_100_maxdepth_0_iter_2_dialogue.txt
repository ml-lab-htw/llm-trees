I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing binary decisions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 65
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Uses exactly 3 decision nodes based on the most important features:
   - Educational_level (threshold at 4, which corresponds to "Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school")
   - DVRT (threshold at 65, which is a meaningful split point for the verbal reasoning test)
   - Type_school (checking if it's vocational school, encoded as 2)

2. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for "certificate not taken" and 1 for "certificate taken"
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition

3. Uses the exact feature keys as provided:
   - "Educational_level"
   - "DVRT"
   - "Type_school"

4. Follows the logic:
   - If Educational_level is low (≤ 4), predict no certificate
   - For higher Educational_level:
     - If DVRT score is low (≤ 65):
       - If it's a vocational school, predict no certificate
       - If it's not a vocational school, predict certificate
     - If DVRT score is high (> 65), predict certificate

The function can be called with a dictionary containing the relevant features and will return both the prediction and the list of node decisions.
