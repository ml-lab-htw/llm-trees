Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # 2 = vocational
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a list of 3 nodes corresponding to the three decision points in our tree:
   - Educational level check (≤4)
   - DVRT score check (≤85)
   - School type check (vocational or not)

2. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (certificate not taken) or 1 (certificate taken)
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The decision logic follows the tree structure:
- If Educational_level ≤ 4, predicts no certificate
- If Educational_level > 4:
  - If DVRT ≤ 85:
    - If Type_school is vocational (2), predicts no certificate
    - If Type_school is not vocational, predicts certificate
  - If DVRT > 85, predicts certificate

The thresholds (Educational_level ≤ 4 and DVRT ≤ 85) are chosen based on the educational level encoding provided and a reasonable assumption about test scores, where 85 represents a moderate achievement level.
