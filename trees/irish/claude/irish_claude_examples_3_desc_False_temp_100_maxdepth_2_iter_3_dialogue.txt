Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided feature information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - The first node checks if the educational level is 5 or lower.
   - The second node checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is 85 or lower.
4. Based on these conditions, it predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not taken (0).
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used (5 for Educational_level and 85 for DVRT) are based on reasonable assumptions, but they might need to be adjusted based on the specific distribution of your data.

Note that this decision tree doesn't use all the provided features. It focuses on Educational_level and DVRT as the most important predictors, which is consistent with the depth-2 tree structure we discussed earlier.
