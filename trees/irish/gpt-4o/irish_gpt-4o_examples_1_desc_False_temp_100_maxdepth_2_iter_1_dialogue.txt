### Explanation:

1. **Node 1**: The first decision is based on the `Educational_level` feature. If the student's educational level is greater than 5 (i.e., beyond Junior cycle terminal leaver), they are more likely to take the school leaving certificate.
   
2. **Node 2**: If the educational level is above 5, the decision is further refined based on the `Type_school`. If the student attended a secondary school (`Type_school == 1`), they are more likely to take the certificate. Otherwise, they are less likely to take it.

3. **Final Prediction**: If the educational level is greater than 5 and the student attended a secondary school, the prediction is that the school leaving certificate is taken (`1`). Otherwise, the prediction is that it is not taken (`0`).

The function returns both the prediction and a list `nodes`, where each entry in the list represents whether the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied (`True` or `False`).
