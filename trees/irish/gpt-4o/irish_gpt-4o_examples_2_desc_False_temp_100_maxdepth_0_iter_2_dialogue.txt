Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree you outlined. The function `predict` will take a dictionary of feature values as input and return a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7.5
    nodes[4] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
    nodes[5] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
            else:
                if nodes[5]:  # Type_school is secondary_terminal leaver
                    if nodes[3]:
                        if nodes[4]:
                            prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
                        else:
                            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate
                else:  # Type_school is vocational
                    prediction = 0  # Vocational certificate

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 18,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

- The `nodes` list is used to store the truth values of the inner nodes. This list is initialized to have six `None` elements, corresponding to the six conditions in our decision tree.
- Each element of the `nodes` list is filled with a boolean value representing whether a particular condition is met.
- The decision tree logic is then implemented using nested if-else statements based on the values in the `nodes` list.
- Finally, the function returns the prediction and the `nodes` list.

In the provided example usage, the function `predict` is called with a dictionary of feature values, and it returns the prediction and the nodes' truth values. The output will help you understand which conditions were satisfied (1) and which were not (0).
