Sure, let's construct a decision tree classifier in Python that classifies whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not, based on the provided features and the assumed decision rules.

Here's the function, structured similarly to the examples you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Apply the decision rules based on thresholds discussed.
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15

    # Decision tree logic for school leaving certificate
    if nodes[0]:  # DVRT <= 50
        if nodes[1]:  # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # no certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # possibly certificate
    else:  # DVRT > 50
        if nodes[2]:  # Educational_level <= 5
            prediction = 1  # possibly certificate
        else:  # Educational_level > 5
            if nodes[3]:  # Prestige_score <= 15
                prediction = 1  # possibly certificate
            else:  # Prestige_score > 15
                prediction = 1  # certificate
        
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 45,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 20,
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Internal Node States: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes Initialization:**
    - An array `nodes` with placeholders for truth values of internal nodes.

2. **Nodes Definitions:**
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (`DVRT`) is ≤ 50.
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the type of school is primary terminal leaver (`Type_school` == 0).
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the educational level attained (`Educational_level`) is ≤ 5.
    - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the prestige score for father's occupation (`Prestige_score`) is ≤ 15.

3. **Tree Logic:**
    - The decision logic follows what was discussed earlier, using truth values to determine the prediction. Based on the given thresholds, it maps out the decision path and concludes with a prediction.

4. **Return Values:**
    - `prediction`: The prediction whether the school leaving certificate is taken (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
    - `nodes`: The list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions at each node.

This Python function should now correctly classify the target variable based on the provided input features, and also give insights into the decision-making process via the list of truth values.
