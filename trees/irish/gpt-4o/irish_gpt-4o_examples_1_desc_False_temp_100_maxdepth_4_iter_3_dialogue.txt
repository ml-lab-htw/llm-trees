Below is the Python implementation of your decision tree, formatted to follow the structure and required conventions you described:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0) 
    based on the given features and return the internal truth values of the nodes.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following features:
        'Sex', 'DVRT', 'Educational_level', 'Prestige_score', 'Type_school'

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for each node.
    """
    
    # Initialize the nodes list with placeholders for the truth values
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Node 0: Highest priority, educational level threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0        # Node 1: Type of school (primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 15             # Node 2: DVRT score threshold
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 12   # Node 3: Prestige score threshold
    
    # Decision tree traversal
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # Type_school == 0 (Primary Terminal Leaver)
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:  # Type_school != 0 (Secondary or Vocational Terminal Leaver)
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # Educational_level > 5
        if nodes[2]:  # DVRT <= 15
            if nodes[3]:  # Prestige_score <= 12
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:  # Prestige_score > 12
                prediction = 1  # Taken
        else:  # DVRT > 15
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the nodes
    return prediction, nodes

### Explanation of the Python Implementation:

1. **Inputs to the Function:**
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` that should contain the following keys: `'Sex'`, `'DVRT'`, `'Educational_level'`, `'Prestige_score'`, `'Type_school'`.

2. **Defining Nodes:**
   - The `nodes` list is initialized to store the truth values (0 or 1) of each decision point (condition) in the tree.
   - Each node's condition corresponds directly to a specific feature and threshold from the decision tree.

3. **Implementation of the Decision Tree Logic:**
   - The logic of the decision tree is implemented as a series of nested `if-else` conditions. Each condition evaluates the corresponding feature value against its threshold or category.

4. **Returning the Outputs:**
   - The function returns two outputs: 
     - `prediction`: The final prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
     - `nodes`: A list that captures whether each inner node's condition was satisfied (`1` = True) or not (`0` = False).

### Example Input and Output:

#### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 10,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 4,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 8,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 0  # Primary-terminal leaver
}
```

#### Example Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, None, None]
```

This implementation adheres to the requirements (a depth of 4, meaningful thresholds, tracking internal nodes as a truth list, etc.) and can be used directly to make predictions based on the given features.
