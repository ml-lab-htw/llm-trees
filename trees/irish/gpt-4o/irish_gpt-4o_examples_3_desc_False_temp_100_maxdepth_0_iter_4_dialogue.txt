Based on your requirements and the provided features, I will implement a decision tree classifier using a Python function that returns a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Hereâ€™s a functional Python code to achieve this:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # We will have 3 decision nodes as per our initial tree structure
    
    # Node 0: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 25
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 25
    
    # Node 1: This node is only relevant if nodes[0] is True
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Educational level attained <= 5
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
        
        # Node 2: This node is only relevant if nodes[1] is True
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Type of school == primary terminal leaver (encoded as 0)
            nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0
        else:
            nodes[2] = None  # This node is not evaluated if nodes[1] is False
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # This node is not evaluated if nodes[0] is False
        nodes[2] = None  # This node is not evaluated if nodes[0] is False
    
    # Prediction logic based on the tree structure
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Not taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Taken
        
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 22,
    "Educational_level": 4,
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Taken' if prediction == 1 else 'Not taken'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this implementation:
-  `nodes[0]` evaluates whether the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is less than or equal to 25.
-  `nodes[1]` evaluates whether the Educational level attained is less than or equal to 5 (only if `nodes[0]` is True).
-  `nodes[2]` evaluates whether the Type of school is primary terminal leaver (encoded as 0) (only if `nodes[1]` is True).

The function `predict` returns a prediction and the list of node conditions, which aligns with your requirement to get a binary indicator (0 or 1) for each decision node based on whether its condition is satisfied or not.

I hope this meets your expectations. Let me know if you need any further customization.
