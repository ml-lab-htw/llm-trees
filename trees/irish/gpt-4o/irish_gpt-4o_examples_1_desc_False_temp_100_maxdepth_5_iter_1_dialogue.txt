Here's the formatted function implementation for the decision tree based on the provided information and conditions, using Python. The function returns a single prediction (0 for not taken, 1 for taken) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0) based on features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary with the following keys:
            - "Sex" (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - "DVRT" (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
            - "Educational_level" (see encoding description above)
            - "Prestige_score" (Prestige score for father's occupation, 0 to 28)
            - "Type_school" (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)
            
    Returns:
        - prediction (int): 0 for not taken, 1 for taken.
        - nodes (list of int): Truth values (1 or 0) corresponding to the inner nodes of the tree.
    """
    nodes = [None] * 5

    # Node 0: Check the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 35

    # Node 1: Check Educational level for low DVRT scores
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    # Node 2: Check Type of school for high DVRT scores
    else:  # DVRT > 35
        nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # Vocational school
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
        else:
            # Node 3: Check Prestige score for father's occupation for secondary schools
            nodes[3] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Secondary school
            if nodes[3]:
                nodes[4] = X["Prestige_score"] > 15
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Not taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Primary_terminal_leaver

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Structure**:
   - The input `X` is a dictionary that contains values for the features `Sex`, `DVRT`, `Educational_level`, `Prestige_score`, and `Type_school`.

2. **Node Definitions**:
   - `nodes` is a list of boolean values (1 for True, 0 for False) that represent whether a condition at a decision tree node is satisfied (`True`) or not satisfied (`False`).
   - The nodes sequentially build the decision tree based on the feature importance and splits.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - **Node 0**: The root of the tree checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (`DVRT`) is less than or equal to 35.
   - **Node 1**: For low DVRT scores, we check if the educational level is less than or equal to 4.
   - **Node 2**: For high DVRT scores, we check if the type of school is `vocational`.
   - **Node 3**: For high DVRT scores and `secondary` school type, we further check the father's occupational prestige score.
   - **Node 4**: Checks whether the prestige of the occupation is greater than 15 in the case of secondary schools.

4. **Branching**:
   - The decision tree executes the logic sequentially to arrive at the prediction while populating the `nodes` list with the truth values of the inner node conditions.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "DVRT": 40,  # high verbal reasoning score
    "Educational_level": 3,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 18,  # High prestige score
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: [False, None, False, True, True]
```

This function incorporates meaningful thresholds and encodes the tree logic to predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken while providing information about which conditions are satisfied along the way.
