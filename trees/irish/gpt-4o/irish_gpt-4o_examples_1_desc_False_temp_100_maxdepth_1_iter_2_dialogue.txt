Below is the Python function implementing a depth-1 decision tree for predicting the target variable `school leaving certificate is taken or not` (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).

The chosen feature for the decision tree is **DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score)**, with an empirically meaningful threshold of `50`, based on the assumption that higher DVRT scores are strongly predictive of completing and taking a school leaving certificate.

### Implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on a decision tree.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following feature keys:
        'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
        'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (higher is better)
        'Educational_level': Encoded as explained in the description
        'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
        'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational

    Returns:
    - prediction (int): The prediction, 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
    - nodes (list[int]): A list containing truth values of the inner nodes.
                         (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = [None]

    # Inner node decision: DVRT <= 50
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 50

    if nodes[0]:  # DVRT score is <= 50
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    else:  # DVRT score is > 50
        prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input feature set:
student_1 = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 45,  # Verbal reasoning test score
    "Educational_level": 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1,  # Secondary terminal leaver
}

student_2 = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 60,  # Verbal reasoning test score
    "Educational_level": 3,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 2,  # Vocational
}

# Predicting for student_1
prediction_1, nodes_1 = predict(student_1)
print(f"Prediction (student_1): {prediction_1}, Nodes (student_1): {nodes_1}")

# Predicting for student_2
prediction_2, nodes_2 = predict(student_2)
print(f"Prediction (student_2): {prediction_2}, Nodes (student_2): {nodes_2}")
```

### Explanation of Outputs:
- `prediction`: Whether the school leaving certificate is taken (0 for not taken, 1 for taken).
- `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner tree node conditions. Since this is a depth-1 tree, `nodes` contains only one entry:
  - `1` means the condition `DVRT <= 50` is satisfied.
  - `0` means the condition `DVRT > 50` is satisfied.

#### Example Outputs:
For `student_1`:
- `Prediction: 0` (not taken, because `DVRT = 45 â‰¤ 50`)
- `Nodes: [1]` (condition `DVRT <= 50` is satisfied)

For `student_2`:
- `Prediction: 1` (taken, because `DVRT = 60 > 50`)
- `Nodes: [0]` (condition `DVRT <= 50` is not satisfied)

### Notes:
- The threshold of `DVRT = 50` was chosen hypothetically as a meaningful separation point. You can update this to reflect actual data insights.
- The function is extendable for larger decision trees by adding more nodes in the `nodes` list and expanding the tree logic.
