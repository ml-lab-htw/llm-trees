Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function adheres to a maximum depth of 2 and includes meaningful thresholds for the splits:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
    based on the provided features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': Encoded educational level attained
        - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
        - 'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Split on Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (DVRT)
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 50.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If DVRT <= 50.0
        # Node 1: Split on Type of school
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
        if nodes[1]:  # If Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # If Type_school != primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # If DVRT > 50.0
        # Node 1: Split on Educational level attained
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver or lower
        if nodes[1]:  # If Educational_level <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # If Educational_level > 5
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features:
   - `'Sex'`: Encoded as 0 (female) or 1 (male).
   - `'DVRT'`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score.
   - `'Educational_level'`: Encoded educational level attained.
   - `'Prestige_score'`: Prestige score for father's occupation.
   - `'Type_school'`: Encoded as 0 (primary_terminal_leaver), 1 (secondary_terminal_leaver), or 2 (vocational).

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the DVRT score is less than or equal to 50.0.
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it checks either the type of school or the educational level attained.

3. **Logic**:
   - If the DVRT score is low (<= 50.0), the next decision is based on the type of school. Students from primary_terminal_leaver schools are less likely to take the certificate.
   - If the DVRT score is high (> 50.0), the next decision is based on the educational level attained. Students with higher educational levels are more likely to take the certificate.

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values indicating whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 45,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 7,  # Primary_terminal_leaver
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 0  # Primary_terminal_leaver
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Not taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1]
