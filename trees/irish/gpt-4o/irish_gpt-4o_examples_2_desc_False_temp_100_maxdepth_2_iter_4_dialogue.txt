Sure! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree for school leaving certificate classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner Node 1: Check the type of school
    nodes[0] = (X['Type_school'] == 1) or (X['Type_school'] == 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Type of school is secondary or vocational
        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
    else:
        # If Type of school is primary_terminal_leaver
        nodes[1] = X['DVRT'] > 50
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Root Node (Depth 1):**
    - The first condition checks the `Type_school` feature:
      - If `Type_school` is `1` (secondary_terminal_leaver) or `2` (vocational), it directly predicts that the school leaving certificate is taken, setting the prediction to `1`.
      - If `Type_school` is `0` (primary_terminal_leaver), it proceeds to the next node.

2. **Second Node (Depth 2):**
    - For `Type_school` equal to `0` (primary_terminal_leaver), it checks the `DVRT` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score):
      - If `DVRT` is greater than `50`, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is taken, setting the prediction to `1`.
      - If `DVRT` is `50` or less, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is not taken, setting the prediction to `0`.

This function will output both the prediction and the list of truth values from the nodes. For example, when you provide an input dictionary to `predict`, it might look like this:

```python
# Example usage
X = {
    'Sex': 1,  # Male
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 7,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Taken' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Taken'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Expected Output:

For the given example input, the function's output would likely be:

```plaintext
Prediction: Taken
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

This means the conditions at the first node are not satisfied (`Type_school` is not 1 or 2), so it moves to the second node to check the `DVRT` score. Since `DVRT` is greater than 50, the prediction will be that the school leaving certificate is taken, and the condition at the second node is satisfied.
