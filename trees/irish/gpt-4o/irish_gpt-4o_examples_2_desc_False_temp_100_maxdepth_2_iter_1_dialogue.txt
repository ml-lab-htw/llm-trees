Based on your provided features and target variable, I'll write a Python function that uses a decision tree of depth 2 to predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. The function will also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree will look like this:
```
|--- Educational_level <= 5
||--- class: Not Taken (0)
|--- Educational_level > 5
||--- DVRT <= 70
|||--- class: Not Taken (0)
||--- DVRT > 70
|||--- class: Taken (1)
```

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 70 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    "Sex": 1,  # 0 = female, 1 = male
    "DVRT": 75,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 22,
    "Type_school": 1  # 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
1. The function constructs a list `nodes` to keep track of the truth values for the conditions in the inner nodes.
2. The first node checks if the "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 5. If true (`nodes[0] == True`), the student is classified as "Not Taken" (`prediction = 0`).
3. If `nodes[0] == False`, then it checks if the "DVRT" score is less than or equal to 70 for the second decision in the tree. If true (`nodes[1] == True`), the student is classified as "Not Taken" (`prediction = 0`), otherwise, the prediction is "Taken" (`prediction = 1`).

You can change the values in `example_features` to test the function with different feature values.
