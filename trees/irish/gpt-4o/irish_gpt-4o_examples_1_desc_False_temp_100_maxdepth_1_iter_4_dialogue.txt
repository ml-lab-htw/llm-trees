Here is the Python function defined for your decision tree with thresholds filled meaningfully based on the feature descriptions provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0)
    based on the features and a decision tree of depth 1.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary with the following keys:
            'Sex': (0 = female, 1 = male),
            'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score,
            'Educational_level': (3rd_level_complete=0, ..., Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school=10),
            'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28),
            'Type_school': (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational).
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 if the school leaving certificate is not taken, 1 if it is taken.
        nodes (list): A list indicating whether conditions of inner nodes are satisfied (1 if true, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # List to store boolean evaluation results of the inner nodes.
    
    # Decision tree with a depth of 1
    # Split based on Educational_level with a threshold of 5 (selected based on intuition).
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5  # True if Educational_level > 5, otherwise False.
    
    # Leaf node predictions based on the condition.
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is likely taken.
    else:
        prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken.
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Decision Logic:**
   - The decision is made based on the `Educational_level` feature, which has a direct bearing on whether the school leaving certificate is taken.
   - A threshold of **5** was chosen, as it differentiates educational levels where individuals have completed junior cycle vs. those who are primary terminal leavers or dropped out earlier.

2. **Interpretation of `nodes`:**
   - `nodes[0]` evaluates the condition `Educational_level > 5`:
     - If the `Educational_level` is greater than 5, `nodes[0] = 1` (True).
     - Otherwise, `nodes[0] = 0` (False).

3. **Return Values:**
   - `prediction` is the predicted class (0 or 1).
   - `nodes` is a list of truth values that indicate whether conditions in the tree's internal nodes are satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Feature set for an individual
example_features = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 56,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Junior cycle terminal leaver - vocational school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 2  # Vocational school
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

# Outputs
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Example output: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Example output: [1] (True, the condition was satisfied)
```

---

### Threshold Justification:
- **Educational_level of 5** is meaningful in this context, as it distinguishes between:
  - Levels where students are likely to have completed at least a portion of secondary-level education.
  - Levels where students likely dropped out earlier (e.g., primary or junior cycle incomplete).

If you want more refinement or additional features for splitting, the tree could be extended (but depth would exceed 1, as specified).
