Based on the decision tree we've discussed earlier, I will format it as a Python function to predict whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the specified features and conditions. The function will return both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes for inner conditions
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] > 62.5
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Type_school == secondary_terminal_leaver

    # Apply decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # school leaving certificate is taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # school leaving certificate is not taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # school leaving certificate is not taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {'Sex': 1, 'DVRT': 88, 'Educational_level': 6, 'Prestige_score': 23, 'Type_school': 1}
# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function:
- The first condition checks whether the "DVRT" (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) is greater than 62.5.
- The second condition checks whether the "Type_school" is equal to 1 (secondary_terminal_leaver).

The function initializes the `nodes` list to store the boolean values of the conditions. It then uses nested if-statements to classify based on these conditions and returns both the prediction and the `nodes` list.

This function aligns with the described conditions:
1. If the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score is greater than 62.5, it evaluates the type of school.
2. If the type of school is secondary (1), it predicts that the certificate is taken (1).
3. Otherwise, it predicts the certificate is not taken (0).
