Here's the implementation of the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and binary target variable. In this function, the nodes represent the inner nodes of the decision tree and whether their respective conditions are satisfied:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]  # Initialize nodes list with None

    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 40  # Check if Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 40
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Check if Educational level attained <= 5 if DVRT > 40

        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15  # Check if Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15 if Educational level <= 5

        else:
            nodes[3] = X["Sex"] == 1  # Check if sex is male if Educational level attained > 5
            if not nodes[3]:
                nodes[4] = X["DVRT"] <= 70  # Further check DVRT <= 70 if sex is female and Educational level > 5

    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[5] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Use type of school for further splitting if DVRT <= 40
        if not nodes[5]:
            nodes[6] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Check for secondary school if DVRT <= 40 and it's not primary terminal leaver

    # Determine the prediction based on the truth values of the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # X["DVRT"] <= 40
        if nodes[5]:  # X["Type_school"] == 0
            prediction = 0  # not taken
        else:
            if nodes[6]:  # X["Type_school"] == 1
                prediction = 0  # not taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # not taken
    else:  # X["DVRT"] > 40
        if nodes[1]:  # X["Educational_level"] <= 5
            if nodes[2]:  # X["Prestige_score"] <= 15
                prediction = 0  # not taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # not taken
        else:  # X["Educational_level"] > 5
            if nodes[3]:  # X["Sex"] == 1
                prediction = 1  # taken
            else:  # X["Sex"] == 0
                if nodes[4]:  # X["DVRT"] <= 70
                    prediction = 1  # taken
                else:  # X["DVRT"] > 70
                    prediction = 0  # not taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Input features example:
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 6,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1
}

# Predict:
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

Explanation:

1. **Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized to track the truth values of the inner nodes of the decision tree.
2. **Conditions:** The conditions are applied to the input `X` to generate the node values. This sequentially evaluates the conditions as specified in the decision tree.
3. **Prediction:** The prediction is made based on the truth values of the nodes. If-else conditions are used to traverse the tree and arrive at a decision.
