Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0) and also returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
            - 'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
            - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
            - 'Educational_level': Educational level attained (see encoding in the description)
            - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
            - 'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5.5  # Threshold chosen based on meaningful split
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level > 5.5
        # Node 1: Check DVRT
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 50.0  # Threshold chosen based on meaningful split
        if nodes[1]:  # DVRT > 50.0
            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
        else:  # DVRT <= 50.0
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken
    else:  # Educational_level <= 5.5
        prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` with the specified feature keys.
2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the `Educational_level` is greater than 5.5. This is the first split in the decision tree.
   - `nodes[1]`: If `Educational_level > 5.5`, it checks if the `DVRT` score is greater than 50.0. This is the second split in the decision tree.
3. **Prediction**:
   - If `Educational_level <= 5.5`, the prediction is `0` (school leaving certificate not taken).
   - If `Educational_level > 5.5` and `DVRT > 50.0`, the prediction is `1` (school leaving certificate taken).
   - If `Educational_level > 5.5` and `DVRT <= 50.0`, the prediction is `0` (school leaving certificate not taken).
4. **Output**: The function returns the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 55,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (school leaving certificate taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```
