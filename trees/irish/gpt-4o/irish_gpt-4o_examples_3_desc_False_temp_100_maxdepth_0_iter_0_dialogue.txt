Sure, let's build the decision tree as a Python function that fits the given format and makes a prediction based on the input dictionary:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 20
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    nodes[4] = X["Educational_level"] > 4

    if nodes[0]:  # Educational level attained <= 7
        if nodes[1]:  # DVRT <= 20
            if nodes[2]:  # Type of school: primary_terminal_leaver
                prediction = 0  # No certificate
            else:  # Type of school: vocational or secondary
                if nodes[3]:  # Educational level attained <= 4
                    prediction = 0  # No certificate
                else:  # Educational level attained > 4
                    prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:  # DVRT > 20
            prediction = 1  # Certificate
    else:  # Educational level attained > 7
        prediction = 1  # Certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,  # Male
    'DVRT': 18,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    'Prestige_score': 12,  # Prestige score for fathers occupation
    'Type_school': 2  # Vocational
}

print(predict(X_example))
```

Explanation:
- `nodes` is a list of boolean conditions for the decision tree's internal nodes.
- `nodes[0]` checks if the `Educational_level` is `<= 7`.
- `nodes[1]` checks if the `DVRT` score is `<= 20`.
- `nodes[2]` checks if the `Type_school` is `primary_terminal_leaver` (`0`).
- `nodes[3]` checks if the `Educational_level` is `<= 4`.
- `nodes[4]` checks if the `Educational_level` is `> 4`.

By evaluating these conditions in sequence, the decision tree structure from before is followed, ensuring that the function returns a valid prediction (`0` for not taken, `1` for taken) and the list of conditions met during the decision-making process.
