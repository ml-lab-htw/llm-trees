Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for your given features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Check node conditions and save the truth values
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Educational level less than or equal to 5
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 50  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score less than or equal to 50

    # Initial decision tree classifier logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No school leaving certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# input_features = {
#     'Sex': 1,  # male
#     'DVRT': 55,
#     'Educational_level': 6,
#     'Prestige_score': 10,
#     'Type_school': 1  # secondary terminal leaver
# }
# result, node_truths = predict(input_features)
# print("Prediction:", result)
# print("Node conditions:", node_truths)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node checks**: 
    - `nodes[0]` checks whether the type of school is 'primary_terminal_leaver' (encoded as 0).
    - `nodes[1]` checks if the educational level attained is less than or equal to 5.
    - `nodes[2]` checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test (DVRT) Score is less than or equal to 50.

2. **Prediction logic**: 
    - If the first condition is met (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the prediction is 0 (No school leaving certificate).
    - If not (`nodes[0]` is `False`), it further checks `nodes[1]`. If `nodes[1]` is `True` (Educational level is less than or equal to 5), it predicts 0.
    - If `nodes[1]` is `False`, it proceeds to check `nodes[2]`. If DVRT Score is less than or equal to 50 (`nodes[2]` is `True`), it predicts 0.
    - If none of these conditions are met, the prediction is 1 (School leaving certificate taken).

The function then returns the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
The given `input_features` can be customized as per the actual data to test various cases. The `predict` function will evaluate the decision tree and give a prediction along with which nodes' conditions were met.
