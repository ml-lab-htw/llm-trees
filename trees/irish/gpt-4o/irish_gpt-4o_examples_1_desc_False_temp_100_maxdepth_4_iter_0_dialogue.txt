Here's the Python function for predicting whether the school-leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0). It also tracks the truth values of the inner nodes as a list.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the nodes
    nodes = [None] * 7  # Total number of inner nodes in the tree

    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 25.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Primary_terminal_leaver
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 18.5
        if nodes[3]:
            nodes[4] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # Vocational
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the code:

1. **Inputs**:
   - `X` is a dictionary containing the features with their exact names and values:
     - `"Sex"`: 0 for female, 1 for male
     - `"DVRT"`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
     - `"Educational_level"`: Encoded values for educational level attained
     - `"Prestige_score"`: Prestige score for father's occupation
     - `"Type_school"`: 0 for primary_terminal_leaver, 1 for secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 for vocational

2. **Nodes**:
   - Nodes represent the truth values (conditions) of the decision tree's inner nodes.
   - For example, `nodes[0]` checks if `"DVRT"` is â‰¤ 25.5.
   - These truth values are stored in the `nodes` list.

3. **Decision Tree**:
   - The logic follows the structure of the decision tree outlined earlier.
   - The `nodes` list tracks whether each condition is satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: Contains the final prediction (1 = taken, 0 = not taken).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 30,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 3,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 2  # Vocational
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Taken)
print(f"Truth values of nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [False, None, None, True, True, None, None]
```
