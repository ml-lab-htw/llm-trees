Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree for the school leaving certificate classification based on the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
            - "Sex" (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - "DVRT" (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
            - "Educational_level" (see encoding in description)
            - "Prestige_score" (0 to 28)
            - "Type_school" (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5

    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level > 5
        # Node 1: Check DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 50

        if nodes[1]:  # DVRT > 50
            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
        else:  # DVRT <= 50
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken
    else:  # Educational_level <= 5
        prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input Features (`X`)**:
   - The function expects a dictionary `X` with keys matching the exact feature names provided:
     - `"Sex"`
     - `"DVRT"` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
     - `"Educational_level"`
     - `"Prestige_score"`
     - `"Type_school"`

2. **Nodes**:
   - A list `nodes` stores the truth values for each inner node in the decision tree. Each element is `1` if the corresponding condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - **Node 0**: The first condition checks whether `Educational_level > 5`. If this condition is satisfied, we proceed to the next node; otherwise, we directly predict `0` (school leaving certificate not taken).
   - **Node 1**: If `Educational_level > 5`, the second condition checks whether `DVRT > 50`. If this condition is satisfied, we predict `1` (school leaving certificate taken); otherwise, we predict `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted target value (`0` or `1`).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 55,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (school leaving certificate taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1] (both conditions satisfied)
```

### Example Outputs:
1. Input: `{"Educational_level": 4, "DVRT": 60, "Sex": 0, "Prestige_score": 10, "Type_school": 2}`
   - Output: `prediction = 0`, `nodes = [0, None]`

2. Input: `{"Educational_level": 7, "DVRT": 45, "Sex": 1, "Prestige_score": 20, "Type_school": 1}`
   - Output: `prediction = 0`, `nodes = [1, 0]`

3. Input: `{"Educational_level": 9, "DVRT": 70, "Sex": 1, "Prestige_score": 25, "Type_school": 1}`
   - Output: `prediction = 1`, `nodes = [1, 1]`
