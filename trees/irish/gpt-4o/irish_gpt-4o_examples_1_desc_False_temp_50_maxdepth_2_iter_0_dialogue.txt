Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree classifier to predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - "Sex": Sex of the child (0 = female, 1 = male)
        - "DVRT": Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - "Educational_level": Educational level attained (see encoding description)
        - "Prestige_score": Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
        - "Type_school": Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
        - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if "Educational_level" <= 6 (Junior cycle terminal leaver or below)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Educational_level <= 6, predict "Not taken"
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if "DVRT" <= 40
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 40
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If DVRT <= 40, predict "Not taken"
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If DVRT > 40, predict "Taken"
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function
1. **Node 0**:
   - The first decision is based on the feature `Educational_level`. If the educational level is less than or equal to 6 (Junior cycle terminal leaver or below), the prediction is `0` (not taken).

2. **Node 1**:
   - If the educational level is above 6, the decision is refined by checking the `DVRT` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score). If the DVRT score is less than or equal to 40, the prediction is `0` (not taken). Otherwise, the prediction is `1` (taken).

3. **Truth Values of Nodes**:
   - The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
     - `nodes[0]` corresponds to whether the condition `Educational_level <= 6` is satisfied.
     - `nodes[1]` corresponds to whether the condition `DVRT <= 40` is satisfied (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`).

### Example Usage
Here is an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 45,  # DVRT score
    "Educational_level": 7,  # Primary_terminal_leaver
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Prestige score
    "Type_school": 2  # Vocational
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Taken)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [False, False]
```

---

### Thresholds Used
- `Educational_level <= 6`: This threshold is chosen to separate those who are less likely to take the school leaving certificate (Junior cycle terminal leaver or below).
- `DVRT <= 40`: This threshold is chosen as a reasonable cutoff for lower academic ability, which might correlate with not taking the certificate.
