Here's the Python function to represent the decision tree classifier for predicting whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the specified features as input, computes the truth values of the inner nodes, and returns a prediction along with the list of truth values.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): Dictionary containing the input features:
            'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
            'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
            'Educational_level': Encoded educational level attained
            'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation
            'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
        nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'Educational_level' <= 5.5
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5.5

    if nodes[0]:  # If 'Educational_level' <= 5.5
        # Node 1: Check if 'Type_school' == 0 (primary_terminal_leaver)
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # If 'Educational_level' > 5.5
        # Node 1: Check if 'DVRT' <= 50
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the feature `Educational_level`. If the value is less than or equal to 5.5, the decision tree proceeds to Node 1 to check the `Type_school`. If `Educational_level` is greater than 5.5, the decision tree instead checks the `DVRT` score.
2. **Node 1 (Left Subtree)**: If `Educational_level` <= 5.5, the tree checks if the `Type_school` is 0 (primary_terminal_leaver). If true, the prediction is 0 (not taken). Otherwise, the prediction is 1 (taken).
3. **Node 1 (Right Subtree)**: If `Educational_level` > 5.5, the tree checks if the `DVRT` score is less than or equal to 50. If true, the prediction is 0 (not taken). Otherwise, the prediction is 1 (taken).

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s an example of how this function can be used:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "DVRT": 55,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds for `Educational_level` (5.5) and `DVRT` (50) are selected based on the hypothetical decision tree described earlier.
- The function ensures that the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`) are returned alongside the prediction for interpretability.
