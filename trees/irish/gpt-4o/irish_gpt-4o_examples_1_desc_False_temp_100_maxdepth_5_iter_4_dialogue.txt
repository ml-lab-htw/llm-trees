Here's the Python function for your decision tree to classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0), based on the given features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0) 
    based on the provided features and also returns the truth values
    of the decision tree's primary nodes.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. 
                  Keys: Sex, DVRT, Educational_level, Prestige_score, Type_school

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 if the school leaving certificate is not taken, 
                          1 if it is taken.
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) 
                      for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions:
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 25  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 25
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6  # Educational level attained <= Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Type of school == primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15  # Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1  # Sex == male (1)

    # Decision rules using a maximum depth of 5:
    if nodes[0]:  # DVRT <= 25
        if nodes[1]:  # Educational_level <= 6
            if nodes[2]:  # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
                prediction = 0  # Not taken
            else:  # Type_school != primary_terminal_leaver
                prediction = 1  # Taken
        else:  # Educational_level > 6
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # DVRT > 25
        if nodes[3]:  # Prestige_score <= 15
            prediction = 1  # Taken
        else:  # Prestige_score > 15
            if nodes[4]:  # Sex == male
                prediction = 0  # Not taken
            else:  # Sex != male (Sex == female)
                prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (DVRT)** is less than or equal to 25.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the **Educational level attained** is less than or equal to 6 (`Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school` or below).
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the **Type of school** is `primary_terminal_leaver` (coded as 0).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the **Prestige score for father's occupation** is less than or equal to 15.
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the **Sex** is male (coded as 1).

2. **Tree logic**:
   - The tree first checks the most important feature (`DVRT`), reducing impurity at the root.
   - Subsequent splits consider **Educational_level**, **Type_school**, **Prestige_score**, and finally **Sex**, with conditions designed to distinguish between students likely to take or forego the certificate.

3. **Output**:
   - `prediction` is the final classification: `0` (not taken) or `1` (taken).
   - `nodes` is a list tracking whether the conditions of the inner nodes are satisfied (`1` for True, `0` for False).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input:
X_sample = {
    "Sex": 1,  # male
    "DVRT": 22,
    "Educational_level": 5,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 14,
    "Type_school": 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
}

# Make a prediction:
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (not taken)
print("Inner nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This should give you the desired decision tree function that satisfies the requirements!
