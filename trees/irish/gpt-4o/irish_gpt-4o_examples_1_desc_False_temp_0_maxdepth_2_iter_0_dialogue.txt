Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a single prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': Encoded educational level attained
        - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
        - 'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): 0 = not taken, 1 = taken
        - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Educational_level <= 5
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 5
        # Node 1: Type_school == 0 (primary_terminal_leaver)
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0
        if nodes[1]:  # Type_school == 0
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # Type_school != 0
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # Educational_level > 5
        # Node 1: DVRT <= 50
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
        if nodes[1]:  # DVRT <= 50
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # DVRT > 50
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features:
   - `'Sex'`: 0 = female, 1 = male
   - `'DVRT'`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
   - `'Educational_level'`: Encoded educational level attained
   - `'Prestige_score'`: Prestige score for father's occupation
   - `'Type_school'`: 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5.
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it checks either:
     - If `Type_school` is 0 (primary_terminal_leaver), or
     - If `DVRT` is less than or equal to 50.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5 and `Type_school` is 0, the prediction is `0` (not taken).
   - If `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5 and `Type_school` is not 0, the prediction is `1` (taken).
   - If `Educational_level` is greater than 5 and `DVRT` is less than or equal to 50, the prediction is `0` (not taken).
   - If `Educational_level` is greater than 5 and `DVRT` is greater than 50, the prediction is `1` (taken).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 55,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
