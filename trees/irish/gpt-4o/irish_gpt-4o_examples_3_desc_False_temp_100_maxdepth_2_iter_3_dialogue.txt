Based on the description of the features and the target variable, here is a Python function implementation for a depth-2 decision tree that predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. The decision tree uses the most important features: "DVRT" and "Educational_level".

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # DVRT <= 50, class: Not Taken (0)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # DVRT > 50 and Educational_level <= 5, class: Not Taken (0)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # DVRT > 50 and Educational_level > 5, class: Taken (1)
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:

# Sample input
sample_input = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 55,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 20,
    "Type_school": 1
}

# Get prediction and the state of the inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The `nodes` list is used to keep track of whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (1) or not (0).
- `nodes[0]` checks if the "DVRT" is less than or equal to 50.
- `nodes[1]` checks if the "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 5.
- Based on the conditions specified by these nodes:
  - If "DVRT" is less than or equal to 50, the prediction is 0 (Not Taken).
  - If "DVRT" is greater than 50, another check is made using "Educational_level":
    - If "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 5, the prediction is 0 (Not Taken).
    - If "Educational_level" is greater than 5, the prediction is 1 (Taken).

This function provides an easy way to classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken based on the specified features and thresholds, including the state (truth values) of the inner nodes for deeper inspection of the decision process.
