Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for the given features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
    based on the input features and a decision tree of depth 2.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
            - 'Sex' (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - 'DVRT' (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
            - 'Educational_level' (see encoding in prompt)
            - 'Prestige_score' (0 to 28)
            - 'Type_school' (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 if the certificate is not taken, 1 if it is taken.
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5.5  # Check if the educational level is greater than 5.5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 50.0  # Check if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is greater than 50.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Educational_level > 5.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If DVRT > 50.0
            prediction = 1  # Certificate is taken
        else:  # If DVRT <= 50.0
            prediction = 0  # Certificate is not taken
    else:  # If Educational_level <= 5.5
        prediction = 0  # Certificate is not taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 55,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and truth values of the inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Certificate is taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the educational level is greater than 5.5. This is the first split in the decision tree. If the condition is satisfied, the tree moves to the second split; otherwise, it predicts `0` (certificate not taken).
2. **Node 1**: Checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is greater than 50.0. This is the second split in the decision tree. If the condition is satisfied, it predicts `1` (certificate taken); otherwise, it predicts `0` (certificate not taken).
3. **Prediction**: Based on the conditions, the function predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken (`1`) or not taken (`0`).

This function adheres to the specified format and uses meaningful thresholds based on the problem description.
