Here is the function to represent the decision tree for predicting whether the school leaving certificate is taken (0 = not taken, 1 = taken). The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns the predicted class along with the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 2.5  # Educational level attained higher than 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 25  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score higher than 25
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] != 0  # Type of school is not primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Sex"] == 0  # Sex is female (0 = female, 1 = male)
    
    # Tree logic for prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Taken
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Nodes construction**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates whether the level of education attained (`Educational_level`) is above 2.5.
   - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates whether the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test (`DVRT`) score is greater than 25.
   - `nodes[2]`: Evaluates whether the type of school (`Type_school`) is not primary_terminal_leaver (primary_terminal_leaver is encoded as 0).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the sex (`Sex`) is female (female encoded as 0, male encoded as 1).

2. **Decision tree logic**: Implements the decision tree structure step-by-step using the nodes' truth values to determine the class:
   - If `Educational_level` is `<= 2.5`, the prediction is directly "Not Taken" (0).
   - If `Educational_level` is `> 2.5`:
     - If `DVRT` is `â‰¤ 25`, the prediction is "Not Taken" (0).
     - If `DVRT` is `> 25`:
       - If `Type_school` is primary_terminal_leaver (`Type_school == 0`), the prediction is "Not Taken" (0).
       - Otherwise:
         - If the child is female (`Sex == 0`), the prediction is "Taken" (1).
         - If the child is male (`Sex == 1`), the prediction is "Not Taken" (0).

3. **Output**:
   - **Prediction**: The class label (0 or 1) indicating whether the school leaving certificate is taken.
   - **Nodes**: A list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for each inner node in the decision tree.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 30,  # Higher than 25
    "Educational_level": 3,  # Higher than 2.5
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]
