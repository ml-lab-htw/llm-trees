Below, I provide the Python function to implement a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken (as the target variable). The tree uses the feature `Educational_level` and a meaningful threshold based on the encoded values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a school leaving certificate is taken (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
    based on the input features and returns the prediction along with the truth values
    of the inner nodes.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing feature values:
            'Sex': int (0 = female, 1 = male)
            'DVRT': float (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score)
            'Educational_level': int (see encoding for details)
            'Prestige_score': int (0 to 28)
            'Type_school': int (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        int: Prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
        list: Truth values for the inner nodes (1 if true, 0 if false)
    """
    
    nodes = [None]  # Initialize a list to keep track of truth values for inner nodes
    
    # Evaluate the decision rule based on Educational_level (threshold value = 5.5)
    # Note: Threshold separates individuals based on educational attainment encoding
    # Values <= 5 correspond to lower education (less likelihood of school leaving certificate),
    # whereas values > 5 suggest higher likelihood.
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # True if Educational_level is 5 or less, False otherwise
    
    # Make prediction based on the decision rule
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Feature Used:** `Educational_level`.  
   This is assumed to be the most important feature determining whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not. It represents the educational attainment level, and its encoded integer values range from 0 to 10.

2. **Threshold:** The threshold is set at `5`.  
   - Values `<= 5` correspond to educational levels that are lower or terminal leavers (e.g., primary_terminal_leaver, junior_cycle_terminal_leaver, etc.), where obtaining a school leaving certificate is less likely.
   - Values `> 5` generally indicate higher educational attainment (e.g., senior_cycle, 3rd_level_incomplete/complete), where obtaining a school leaving certificate is more likely.

3. **Nodes List:**  
   The `nodes` list tracks whether the condition of the inner decision node was satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false). This can help trace execution during predictions.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
example_input = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 12.5,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    "Type_school": 1,  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Taken)
print("Inner Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False]
```

### Features Summary Reference (Encoding Recap):
- **Sex:** 0 = female, 1 = male.
- **DVRT:** Continuous (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score).
- **Educational_level:**
  - 0: 3rd_level_complete
  - 1: 3rd_level_incomplete
  - 2: ?
  - 3: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - 4: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - 5: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - 6: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
  - 7: Primary_terminal_leaver
  - 8: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - 9: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - 10: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school.
