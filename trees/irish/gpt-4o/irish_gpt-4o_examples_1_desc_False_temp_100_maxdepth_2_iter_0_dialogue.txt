Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features and instructions you provided. The function makes a prediction whether the school leaving certificate is taken (`target = 1`) or not (`target = 0`), and it also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Create a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Educational level attained <= 5.5 (corresponding to values 5, 6, and 7 in the Educational_level feature)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] >= 5
    
    # Node 1: Type of school is primary_terminal_leaver (encoded as 0 in Type_school)
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0

    # Decision logic for prediction based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # If Educational_level >= 5 (i.e., level attained <= Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver)
        if nodes[1]:  # If Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # No certificate
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No certificate
    else:  # If Educational_level < 5 (i.e., Senior_cycle_incomplete or higher)
        prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
- **Node 0** checks if the `Educational_level` is greater than or equal to 5. This corresponds to people who are below or at the "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver" levels, which are highly correlated with not completing school.
- **Node 1** checks whether the student attended a **primary_terminal_leaver** type of school (`Type_school == 0`). This is another strong indicator of not obtaining the certificate.
  
**If both conditions are true**, the individual is classified as **not having taken the leaving certificate**. If the `Educational_level` is higher than the threshold, they are classified as **having obtained the certificate**.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Sex': 1,  # Male
    'DVRT': 50,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,  # Father's occupation prestige
    'Type_school': 0,  # Primary_terminal_leaver
    'target': None  # This is what we're predicting
}

# Make the prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the prediction and the truth values of the nodes
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (no certificate)
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
``` 

In this example, the prediction would be `0` (no certificate), and the inner nodes would both evaluate to `True`, meaning both conditions were satisfied. 

You can apply this function to any new data point formatted as a dictionary with the correct feature keys!
