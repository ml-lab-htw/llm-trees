Below is the Python function implementing your decision tree. The function uses the specified features and evaluates the conditions at each internal node, returning both the predicted value and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

### Python Function for Prediction
```python
def predict(features: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken),
    and provides a list of truth values for inner node conditions.

    Args:
        features (dict): A dictionary of input features with the following keys:
            - 'Sex' (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - 'DVRT' (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
            - 'Educational_level' (0 to 10 based on categories provided)
            - 'Prestige_score' (fathers occupation prestige score, range from 0 to 28)
            - 'Type_school' (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 if school leaving certificate is NOT taken, 1 if it is taken.
            - nodes (List[int]): Truth values (1 or 0) for the decision tree's inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Node 0: Educational level condition
    nodes[0] = features["Educational_level"] > 4.5

    # Node 1: Type of school condition (only evaluated if Node 0 is False)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = features["Type_school"] == 0  # "primary_terminal_leaver"

    # Node 2: DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test) score condition (only evaluated if Node 0 is True)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[2] = features["DVRT"] > 25

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Node 0: Educational level > 4.5
        if nodes[2]:  # Node 2: DVRT > 25
            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
        else:  # DVRT <= 25
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is NOT taken
    else:  # Educational level <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Node 1: Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is NOT taken
        else:  # Type_school != primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is NOT taken

    # Convert nodes to integer values (1 for True, 0 for False) and return result
    nodes = [int(cond) if cond is not None else None for cond in nodes]
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
```python
# Example input features
features = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 30,  # DVRT score
    "Educational_level": 5,  # Junior cycle terminal leaver - secondary school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary terminal leaver
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (school leaving certificate is taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, None, 1] (truth values for the inner nodes)
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0 (Root Node - `Educational_level` > 4.5)**:
   - If `Educational_level` is greater than 4.5, move along the "Yes" branch (to Node 2).
   - If `Educational_level` â‰¤ 4.5, move along the "No" branch (to Node 1).

2. **Node 1 (`Type_school` == primary_terminal_leaver)**:
   - If the student attended a primary_terminal_leaver school (`Type_school` == 0), they did **not** take the certificate (prediction = 0).
   - Otherwise, they also did not take the certificate (prediction = 0).

3. **Node 2 (`DVRT` > 25)**:
   - If they scored higher than 25 on the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test, they took the certificate (prediction = 1).
   - Otherwise, they did not take the certificate (prediction = 0).

### Test Cases
```python
# Test case 1: High educational level and high DVRT score
features = {"Sex": 0, "DVRT": 30, "Educational_level": 6, "Prestige_score": 18, "Type_school": 2}
print(predict(features))  # Output: (1, [1, None, 1])

# Test case 2: Low educational level and primary_terminal_leaver school
features = {"Sex": 1, "DVRT": 20, "Educational_level": 3, "Prestige_score": 5, "Type_school": 0}
print(predict(features))  # Output: (0, [0, 1, None])

# Test case 3: Low educational level and non-primary_terminal_leaver school
features = {"Sex": 0, "DVRT": 18, "Educational_level": 4, "Prestige_score": 10, "Type_school": 2}
print(predict(features))  # Output: (0, [0, 0, None])
```

This implementation ensures that the function works dynamically based on the input features and provides a trace of decisions made during the classification.
