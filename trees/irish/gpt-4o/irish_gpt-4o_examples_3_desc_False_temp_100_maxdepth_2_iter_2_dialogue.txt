Certainly! Based on the provided feature set and the previous decision tree, let's create a Python function that returns both a single prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree for classifying whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.

Here is the function constructed accordingly:

```python
def predict(X):
    # Define the inner nodes based on the decision tree structure
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (DVRT) check
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
    # Node 1: only evaluated if DVRT > 50, checks Educational Level attained
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6 if not nodes[0] else None

    # Determine the prediction based on the nodes' truth values
    if nodes[0]:
        # DVRT <= 50
        if X["Type_school"] == 0:  # primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0   # Not taken
        else:  # secondary_terminal_leaver or vocational
            prediction = 1   # Taken
    else:
        # DVRT > 50
        if nodes[1]:
            # Educational_level <= 6
            prediction = 0   # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1   # Taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,  # male
    'DVRT': 45,  # Example score
    'Educational_level': 3,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,  # Example prestige score
    'Type_school': 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Nodes Initialization**: The `nodes` array holds the truth values for the internal splits. Since the tree has a maximum depth of 2, we have two crucial decision nodes.
2. **Node 0**: Checks if the `DVRT` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) is less than or equal to 50.
3. **Node 1**: Only checked if `DVRT` is greater than 50. This node checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 6.
4. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If `DVRT` is less than or equal to 50 (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the decision then depends on the type of school (`Type_school`).
     - If the type of school is `primary_terminal_leaver`, it predicts that the certificate is not taken (`0`).
     - Otherwise (`secondary_terminal_leaver` or `vocational`), it predicts that the certificate is taken (`1`).
   - If `DVRT` is greater than 50 (`nodes[0]` is `False`), it checks the educational level (`nodes[1]`).
     - If `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 6 (`nodes[1]` is `True`), it predicts that the certificate is not taken (`0`).
     - Otherwise (`nodes[1]` is `False`), it predicts that the certificate is taken (`1`).

### Example Usage:
In the provided example, the function `predict` will return the prediction for the given feature set along with the nodesâ€™ truth values. Modify the `X_example` dictionary to validate different scenarios based on the feature values.
