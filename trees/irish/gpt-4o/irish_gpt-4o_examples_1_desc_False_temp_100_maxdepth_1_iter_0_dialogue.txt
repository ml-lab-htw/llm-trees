Based on the description and requirements you've provided, I will write a Python function for a decision tree with a depth of 1 that classifies whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not. The decision tree uses the `Educational_level` feature as the most important predictor, with a threshold value chosen based on reasonable assumptions for the dataset.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not based on input features.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary of input features with keys:
            'Sex': Sex of the child (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
            'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
            'Educational_level': Educational level attained
            'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation
            'Type_school': Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        prediction (int): Predicted target value (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
        nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes, where 1 indicates the condition was satisfied and 0 otherwise.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Educational_level threshold chosen to divide those likely to take the certificate from those who are not
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Threshold is based on values such as Junior cycle terminal leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate not taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input:**  
   - `X`: A dictionary containing the input features (`Sex`, `DVRT`, `Educational_level`, `Prestige_score`, `Type_school`).

2. **Decision Rule:**  
   - The decision rule focuses on `Educational_level` because it is most relevant for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken.
   - Threshold `5` is chosen because levels `<= 5` typically represent students who did not progress far enough (e.g., terminal leavers).
   - Values above `5` suggest further educational attainment, which correlates with taking the school leaving certificate.

3. **Output:**  
   - `prediction`: A binary target value (`0` = not taken, `1` = taken).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes. Since the tree has only one decision node, the list contains a single truth value.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 120,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 4,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 18,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

---

### Notes:
- The chosen threshold (`Educational_level <= 5`) can be fine-tuned based on actual data and context for better classification performance.
- `nodes` is a list containing the result of the decision node evaluation, which can help debug the classification process or extend the tree if needed.
