Here’s the Python function representing the decision tree for classifying whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not taken (0). The function uses the provided feature keys and the exact formatting guidelines:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Decision Tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 4
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # Educational_level > 4
        nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 35
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]`: True if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 4, otherwise False.
   - `nodes[1]`: True if `Type_school` is `0` (primary_terminal_leaver), otherwise False.
   - `nodes[2]`: True if `DVRT` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) is less than or equal to 35, otherwise False.

2. **Tree Logic:**
   - The split on `Educational_level` is the root of the decision tree.
   - If `Educational_level <= 4`, we further split based on `Type_school`.
   - If `Educational_level > 4`, the next split is based on `DVRT`.

### Example Usage:

To use the function, provide a dictionary containing the feature values:

```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 40,
    "Educational_level": 5,
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (school leaving certificate taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, None, False]
```

### Example Explanation:
For the given input:
- `Educational_level = 5` → `nodes[0] = False` (go to the else branch).
- `DVRT = 40` → `nodes[2] = False` (score is greater than 35).
- Therefore, the prediction is `1` (school leaving certificate is taken).
