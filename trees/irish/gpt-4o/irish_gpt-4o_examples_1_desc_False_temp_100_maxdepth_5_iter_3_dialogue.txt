Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for the provided features with the requested format and logic. I have filled in thresholds based on reasonable interpretations of the data description.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
    based on the provided features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary representing the feature values. 
              Expected keys: ['Sex', 'DVRT', 'Educational_level', 'Prestige_score', 'Type_school']

    Returns:
    (int, list): A tuple containing:
                 - The prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
                 - A list of truth values (1 for satisfied, 0 for not satisfied) for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 6.5  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4.5  # Educational level attained
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Type of school: primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 14.5  # Prestige score for father's occupation
    nodes[4] = X["Educational_level"] > 6.5  # Additional condition on educational level

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # DVRT <= 6.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Educational_level <= 4.5
            if nodes[2]:  # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
            else:  # Type_school != primary_terminal_leaver
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
        else:  # Educational_level > 4.5
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:  # DVRT > 6.5
        if nodes[3]:  # Prestige_score <= 14.5
            if nodes[4]:  # Educational_level > 6.5
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
            else:  # Educational_level <= 6.5
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
        else:  # Prestige_score > 14.5
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Input**:
    - `X`: A dictionary of feature values. Expected keys:
      - `"Sex"`: (0 = female, 1 = male)
      - `"DVRT"`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
      - `"Educational_level"`: Encoded values for the educational level attained
      - `"Prestige_score"`: Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
      - `"Type_school"`: Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

2. **Nodes**:
    - Each node represents a condition, which is stored as a Boolean in the `nodes` list (1 = satisfied, 0 = not satisfied).
    - The tree has 5 nodes (`nodes[0]` to `nodes[4]`) representing the inner decision criteria.

3. **Logic**:
    - The prediction is determined by traversing the decision tree and checking the conditions at each node.
    - Leaf nodes return either `0` (school leaving certificate not taken) or `1` (school leaving certificate taken).

4. **Output**:
    - The function returns:
      - `prediction`: The final classification (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
      - `nodes`: A list of truth values (1 for satisfied, 0 for not satisfied) corresponding to the conditions of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
example_features = {
    "Sex": 1,  # male
    "DVRT": 7.0,  # DVRT score
    "Educational_level": 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 16,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Run the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False, False, False, True]
```

This function can be incorporated into a larger model for decision-making or testing with appropriate datasets.
