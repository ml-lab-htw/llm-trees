Sure! Here is the Python function to perform the task using the given features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 15
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # primary_terminal_leaver
    
    # Decision path and final prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example input dictionary
example_input = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 14,
    "Educational_level": 5,
    "Prestige_score": 10,
    "Type_school": 0
}

# Run the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inner nodes with conditions:**
   - `nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 15`: Checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score is less than or equal to 15.
   - `nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0`: Checks if the type of school is primary_terminal_leaver.

2. **Decision path and final prediction:**
   - When both conditions hold true (`nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`), the prediction is 0 (Certificate Not Taken).
   - When the test score condition holds true but the type of school is not primary_terminal_leaver, the prediction is 1 (Certificate Taken).
   - When the test score condition does not hold true (`nodes[0]` is False), the prediction is 1 (Certificate Taken).

### Usage:
- You provide feature values in a dictionary (like the `example_input`).
- The function `predict` processes the dictionary to determine whether a school leaving certificate is taken.
- The function returns the prediction and the list of inner node truths. 

You can feed different feature values to `example_input` and run the `predict` function to get corresponding predictions and inner node truth values.
