### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (DVRT)** is less than or equal to 50.
- If it is, the decision moves to **Node 1**, where it checks the **Educational level attained**. If the educational level is 4 or below (corresponding to incomplete junior cycle), the prediction is that the school leaving certificate was **not taken** (0). Otherwise, it predicts that the certificate was **taken** (1).
- If the test score is higher than 50 (Node 0 is false), we check the **Type of school**. If the student is a **primary terminal leaver** (Type_school == 0), the prediction is **no certificate** (0), otherwise the prediction is **certificate taken** (1).

This function returns both the prediction and a list of Boolean values corresponding to whether each node's condition was satisfied (1 for True, 0 for False).
