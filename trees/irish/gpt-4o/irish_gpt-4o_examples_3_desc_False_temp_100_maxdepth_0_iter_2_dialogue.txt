Given the structure of the features and the target variable, I'll write a function to model the decision tree for predicting whether the school leaving certificate is taken (1) or not (0). I'll use the keys and encodings you provided for the decision-making process.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Evaluating the decision conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # educational level less than or equal to Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 60
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Type of school is primary_terminal_leaver

    # Determine prediction based on decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # not taken
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # taken
            
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Define a sample input as a dictionary
sample_input = {
    'Sex': 0,  # assuming 'female'
    'DVRT': 65,
    'Educational_level': 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, node_evaluations = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Node evaluations: {node_evaluations}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the educational level attained is less than or equal to the threshold. According to your description, this corresponds to educational levels up to "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school."
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the DVRT score is 60 or below.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the type of school is "primary_terminal_leaver."

2. **Prediction Logic:**
   - If the educational level attained (`nodes[0]`) is up to and including 5 (Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school), classify as `0` (school leaving certificate not taken).
   - If the educational level is higher and the type of school is "primary_terminal_leaver" (`nodes[2]`), classify as `0` (not taken).
   - Otherwise, classify as `1` (school leaving certificate taken).

The function returns the prediction (`0` or `1`) along with a list indicating the truth values of the evaluated nodes. This structure ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and traceable.
