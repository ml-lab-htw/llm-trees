Based on your provided feature set and decision rules, let's implement a Python function that applies the decision tree logic to classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not, alongside a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions.

Here is the formatted decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list with None values
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Evaluate the conditions for the internal nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] >= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 50
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Type_school"] != 0

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # school leaving certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # school leaving certificate not taken
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # school leaving certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # school leaving certificate not taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 4,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, node_truth_values = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Node Truth Values: {node_truth_values}")
```

The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` representing the features as input and returns:
1. `prediction`: 0 for 'not taken' and 1 for 'taken'.
2. `node_truth_values`: a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions at the nodes in the decision tree.

In this decision tree:
- `nodes[0]` checks if the educational level attained is greater than or equal to 5.
- `nodes[1]` checks if the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score is greater than 50.
- `nodes[2]` checks if the type of school is secondary.
- `nodes[3]` is included to represent further potential logic, even though it is not used directly in the primary decision path in this simple model.

You can change `features` with actual data to see how the function performs. Adjust the threshold values and node checks if you have more accurate or specific rules based on actual data distributions and importance metrics.
