Here is the Python function based on your specified decision tree for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not. I have carefully implemented the rules and conditions from the constructed decision tree, and ensured that the feature names and target values match your specifications.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not, based on input features.
    
    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary of input feature values with the following keys:
        - 'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': 0 to 10 (encoded as described above)
        - 'Prestige_score': 0 to 28
        - 'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes), where prediction is 0 (not taken) or 1 (taken),
           and nodes is a list of truth values (1 for satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes of the tree.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize a list to track truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # Step 1: Educational level attained <= 5.0
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Educational level <= 5.0
        # Step 2: Type of school (primary terminal leaver = 0)
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Type of school is primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # Type of school is secondary_terminal_leaver or vocational
            # Step 3: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score <= 20.0
            nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 20.0
            
            if nodes[2]:  # DVRT score <= 20.0
                prediction = 0  # Not taken
            else:  # DVRT score > 20.0
                prediction = 1  # Taken
    
    else:  # Educational level > 5.0
        # Step 2: Prestige score for father's occupation <= 15.0
        nodes[1] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15.0
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Prestige score <= 15.0
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # Prestige score > 15.0
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Nodes (truth values list):**
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5.0`.
   - `nodes[1]`: For branch `Educational_level <= 5.0`, whether `Type_school` is primary_terminal_leaver (0). For branch `Educational_level > 5.0`, whether `Prestige_score` is less than or equal to `15.0`.
   - `nodes[2]`: For branch `Educational_level <= 5.0` and non-primary_terminal_leaver, whether `DVRT` is less than or equal to `20.0`.
   
2. **Decision Making:**
   - The decision tree follows the conditions outlined, with nested conditions depending on earlier splits.
   
3. **Input Format:**
   - The input `X` is expected to be a dictionary of features with keys matching the exact names and encoding listed in the problem description.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns a `prediction` (0 for "not taken", 1 for "taken") and a list `nodes` that captures whether each inner node's condition was satisfied (`1` = True, `0` = False).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
features = {
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "DVRT": 25,  # verbal reasoning test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    "Prestige_score": 18,  # father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 2  # vocational
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Example: 1 (certificate taken)
print(f"Truth values of nodes: {nodes}")  # Example: [0, 0, None]
```

You can adjust the thresholds or test the function for various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
