Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier based on your specified features, thresholds, and target variable encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree classifier for predicting whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of input features with the following keys:
            - "Sex" (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - "DVRT" (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)
            - "Educational_level" (see description for encoding)
            - "Prestige_score" (0 to 28)
            - "Type_school" (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 = school leaving certificate not taken, 1 = school leaving certificate taken
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if "Educational_level" <= 5
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If "Educational_level" <= 5, predict 0 (not taken)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if "DVRT" <= 50
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If "DVRT" <= 50, predict 0 (not taken)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If "DVRT" > 50, predict 1 (taken)
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature (e.g., "Sex", "DVRT", etc.), and the value is the feature's value for a given instance.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes` is a list that stores truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `Educational_level <= 5`.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `DVRT <= 50`.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The first decision is based on the "Educational_level" feature. If `Educational_level <= 5`, the prediction is 0 (school leaving certificate not taken). Otherwise, the decision proceeds to the next feature.
   - The second decision is based on the "DVRT" feature. If `DVRT <= 50`, the prediction is 0 (not taken). Otherwise, the prediction is 1 (taken).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns two values:
     - `prediction`: The final prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 60,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (school leaving certificate taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
```

This function is aligned with your requirements, using the specified feature names, thresholds, and target encoding.
