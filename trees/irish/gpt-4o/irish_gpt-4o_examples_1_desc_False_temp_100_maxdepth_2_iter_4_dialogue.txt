Here is the Python function based on your requested decision tree that takes a dictionary `X` with feature values and returns a prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check Educational_level
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] > 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Check DVRT if Educational_level > 5
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 60
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **`nodes[0]`**: This corresponds to the first decision point in the tree, which checks whether the **Educational_level** is greater than 5.
- **`nodes[1]`**: If **Educational_level** is greater than 5, we move on to the second decision point, which checks whether the **DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score)** is greater than 60.
- The final prediction is made based on these two conditions:
  - If **Educational_level** is 5 or less, the prediction is that the certificate was **not taken** (0).
  - If **Educational_level** is greater than 5 and **DVRT** is greater than 60, the prediction is that the certificate was **taken** (1). Otherwise, it was **not taken** (0).

This function does not require any actual data for training, and it reflects the decision tree you requested with a maximum depth of 2.
