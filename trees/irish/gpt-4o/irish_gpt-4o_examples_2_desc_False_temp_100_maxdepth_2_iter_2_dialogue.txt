Based on your provided information, the decision tree can be created using the features: "Educational_level" and "DVRT." We will use Python to make our prediction function. Here is how the function can be structured:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:

# Input data
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # male
    "DVRT": 60,  # high score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver_vocational_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # prestige score
    "Type_school": 2  # vocational
}

# Getting prediction and nodes states
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node states: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
1. **nodes list:** It has two inner nodes for our decision tree based on the features "Educational_level" and "DVRT".
2. **nodes[0]:** Checks if "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 5.
3. **nodes[1]:** Checks if "DVRT" score is less than or equal to 50.
4. **Prediction logic:**
   - If the educational level is 5 or lower, it predicts that the school leaving certificate is not taken (`0`).
   - If the educational level is higher than 5, it then checks the "DVRT" score.
   - Depending on whether the "DVRT" score is below or above 50, it makes the corresponding prediction (not taken `0` or taken `1`).

The `predict` function also returns the state of each node which helps in understanding the decision path taken within the decision tree.
