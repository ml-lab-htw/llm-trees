### Python Function to Predict School Leaving Certificate:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Type of school
    nodes[0] = (X["Type_school"] == 0)
    
    # Node 1: Educational level attained
    nodes[1] = (X["Educational_level"] <= 4)
    
    # Node 2: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
    nodes[2] = (X["DVRT"] <= 25)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If the type of school is primary_terminal_leaver
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If the type of school is either secondary_terminal_leaver or vocational
        if nodes[1]:
            # If educational level attained is <= 4
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If educational level attained is > 4
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score is <= 25
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # If Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score is > 25
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage:
features = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 27,
    'Educational_level': 6,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

print(predict(features))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if the **Type of School** is `primary_terminal_leaver` (encoded as `0`). If `True`, the immediate prediction is `0` (not taken). If `False`, it proceeds to the next check.
2. **Node 1** checks if the **Educational Level Attained** is `<= 4`. If `True`, the prediction is `0` (not taken). If `False`, we proceed further.
3. **Node 2** checks if the **Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score** is `<= 25`. If `True`, the prediction is `0` (not taken). If `False`, the prediction is `1` (taken).

This function captures the decision-making process described in the decision tree, maintaining the truth values of each node in the list `nodes`, which helps trace the path taken to reach the prediction.
