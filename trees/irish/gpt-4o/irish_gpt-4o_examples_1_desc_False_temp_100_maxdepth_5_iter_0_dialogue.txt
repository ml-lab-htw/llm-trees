Below is the Python function `predict()` based on your decision tree and specifications for the dataset on whether a school leaving certificate is taken. The function also returns a truth value list for the inner nodes of the decision tree (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) 
    based on the provided features.
    
    Args:
        X: dict
            Dictionary containing the following keys:
            - 'Sex' (int): Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
            - 'DVRT' (float): Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
            - 'Educational_level' (int): Educational level attained
            - 'Prestige_score' (float): Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
            - 'Type_school' (int): Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 
                                                1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 
                                                2 = vocational)
    
    Returns:
        prediction: int
            Predicted class (0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken)
        nodes: list of int
            Truth values of the decision tree nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    # Initialize a list of nodes (inner node conditions)
    nodes = [None] * 5  # 5 nodes in the decision tree

    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 2  # Node 1: Educational level <= 2

    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 45.0           # Node 3: DVRT <= 45.0
    nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] <= 15.0 # Node 4: Prestige score <= 15.0
    nodes[4] = X["Sex"] == 1               # Node 5: Sex = male

    if nodes[0]:  # Educational_level <= 2
        if nodes[1]:  # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # Class: Not taken
        else:  # Type_school != primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 1  # Class: Taken
    else:  # Educational_level > 2
        if nodes[2]:  # DVRT <= 45.0
            if nodes[3]:  # Prestige_score <= 15.0
                prediction = 0  # Class: Not taken

                prediction = 1  # Class: Taken
            else:  # Sex == female
                prediction = 1  # Class: Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example usage:

Suppose we want to predict for the following input:

```python
input_features = {
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "DVRT": 50.0,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 3,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 18.0,  # Prestige score
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)

print("Prediction (0 = Not taken, 1 = Taken):", prediction)
print("Truth values of nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output:
```plaintext
Prediction (0 = Not taken, 1 = Taken): 1
Truth values of nodes: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Explanation:
- `Educational_level = 3` → Node 0 condition (`Educational_level <= 2`) is **not satisfied** → `nodes[0] = 0`.
- `Type_school = 1` → Node 1 condition (`Type_school == 0`) is **not satisfied** → `nodes[1] = 0`.
- `DVRT = 50.0` → Node 2 condition (`DVRT <= 45.0`) is **not satisfied** → `nodes[2] = 0`.
- `Prestige_score = 18.0` → Node 3 condition (`Prestige_score <= 15.0`) is **not satisfied** → `nodes[3] = 0`.
- `Sex = 0` → Node 4 condition (`Sex == 1`) is **not satisfied** → `nodes[4] = 0`.

Since the thresholds, tree structure, and feature encodings have been carefully incorporated, this function can accurately classify the input based on the decision tree logic.
