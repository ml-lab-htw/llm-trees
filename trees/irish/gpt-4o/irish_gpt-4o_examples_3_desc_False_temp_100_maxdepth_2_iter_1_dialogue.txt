Here's the Python function that uses the decision tree model to classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not. It also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the nodes array to hold truth values for inner nodes
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Evaluate the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 40
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the first condition is satisfied, classify based on the second condition
        prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the second condition is satisfied, classify accordingly
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
        else:
            # Otherwise, classify as certificate taken
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input dictionary
input_features = {
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "DVRT": 55,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    "Prestige_score": 10,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Perform prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Nodes List:** This list `nodes` will store the truth values for the conditions in the decision tree.
2. **First Node Evaluation:** Check if `DVRT` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) is less than or equal to 40. This is stored in `nodes[0]`.
    - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, the prediction is `0` (certificate not taken) as the low test score suggests lower academic achievement.
3. **Second Node Evaluation:** If `DVRT` is greater than 40 (`nodes[0]` is `False`), check if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5. This is stored in `nodes[1]`.
    - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, the prediction is `0` (certificate not taken) as a low educational level suggests not achieving the certificate.
    - If `nodes[1]` is `False`, the prediction is `1` (certificate taken).
    
This function directly maps the structure of the decision tree as described. Adjustments should be made based on real data and feature importance for final implementation.
