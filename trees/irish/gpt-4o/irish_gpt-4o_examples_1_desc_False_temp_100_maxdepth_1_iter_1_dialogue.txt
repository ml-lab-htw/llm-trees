Based on your request, here is a Python function that implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. It predicts whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not (`target`), and it returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree function for predicting whether a school leaving certificate is taken or not.
    
    Input:
    - X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        ['Sex', 'DVRT', 'Educational_level', 'Prestige_score', 'Type_school']
        
    Output:
    - prediction (int): 0 = certificate not taken, 1 = certificate taken
    - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes
    """
    
    # Initialize the list for truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None]
    
    # Decision criterion (maximum depth of 1)
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4.5
    
    # Make a prediction based on the decision criterion
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Certificate NOT taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Argument `X`**:
   It is a dictionary representing the feature values for a single instance. The required keys are:
   - `Sex`: 0 = female, 1 = male
   - `DVRT`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (numeric)
   - `Educational_level`: Educational level attained (ordinal levels mapped to integers)
   - `Prestige_score`: Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
   - `Type_school`: Type of school (0 = primary, 1 = secondary, 2 = vocational)
   
2. **Node Threshold**:
   The decision is based on `Educational_level` (the most important feature) with a threshold of `4.5`. Individuals with an educational level of `4.5` or below are predicted to have NOT taken the school leaving certificate, while those with a value greater than `4.5` are predicted to have taken it. This threshold was chosen to split the population into two meaningful groups.

3. **Output**:
   - `prediction` is either `0` (certificate not taken) or `1` (certificate taken).
   - `nodes` is a list representing the truth value of the condition for the inner decision node (`Educational_level <= 4.5`). It holds `1` (True) if the condition is satisfied and `0` (False) otherwise.

### Example Usage:
Let's test the function with some example inputs:

```python
# Example input 1
X1 = {
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "DVRT": 50,  # score of 50
    "Educational_level": 3,  # Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # mid-level prestige
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary school
}
print(predict(X1))  
# Output: (0, [True]) -- Certificate NOT taken (Educational level <= 4.5 is True)

# Example input 2
X2 = {
    "Sex": 1,  # male
    "DVRT": 65,  # score of 65
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # high prestige
    "Type_school": 2  # vocational school
}
print(predict(X2))  
# Output: (1, [False]) -- Certificate taken (Educational level <= 4.5 is False)
```
