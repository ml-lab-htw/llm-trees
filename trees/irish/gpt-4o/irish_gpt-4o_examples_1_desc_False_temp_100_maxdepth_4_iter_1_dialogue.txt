Below is the Python function for predicting whether the school leaving certificate is taken (target: 0 = not taken, 1 = taken). The function implements the decision tree classifier described earlier, adhering to the feature and target key specifications you've provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the school leaving certificate is taken (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
    based on the decision tree and return a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary with the following keys:
        - 'Sex': 0 = female, 1 = male
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': Encoded educational level value
        - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
        - 'Type_school': 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): The predicted value (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """

    nodes = [None] * 5  # There are 4 inner nodes in the decision tree, so we create a list of size 5 for clarity.

    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 45
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    nodes[2] = X["Type_school"] == 2  # vocational
    nodes[3] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[4] = X["Prestige_score"] > 15

    # Decision tree traversal
    if nodes[0]:  # DVRT <= 45
        if nodes[1]:  # Educational_level <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # Educational_level > 5
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:  # DVRT > 45
        if nodes[2]:  # Type_school == vocational
            prediction = 1  # Taken
        elif nodes[3]:  # Type_school == secondary_terminal_leaver
            if nodes[4]:  # Prestige_score > 15
                prediction = 1  # Taken
            else:  # Prestige_score <= 15
                prediction = 0  # Not taken
        else:  # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0  # Not taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

### How It Works
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys correspond to the features provided (`Sex`, `DVRT`, `Educational_level`, `Prestige_score`, `Type_school`).

2. **Nodes List**: A list `nodes` represents the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether `DVRT` ≤ 45.
   - `nodes[1]`: Whether `Educational_level` ≤ 5.
   - `nodes[2]`: Whether `Type_school` is vocational (`Type_school` == 2).
   - `nodes[3]`: Whether `Type_school` is secondary terminal leaver (`Type_school` == 1).
   - `nodes[4]`: Whether `Prestige_score` > 15.

3. **Tree Traversal**: Conditions are evaluated step-by-step to determine the classification (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).

4. **Output**: The function returns a tuple:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class for the school leaving certificate (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values (1 if a node's condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

### Example Usage
```python
# Input features for a student
X = {
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "DVRT": 50,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    "Educational_level": 9,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1,  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Run the prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the prediction and nodes
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Example Output
```plaintext
Prediction: 1 (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)
Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
```

This output indicates that the model predicts the school leaving certificate is taken (1), and the node evaluations reveal which conditions were satisfied (1 for true, 0 for false).

This function can be expanded or refined further if real-world data or more specific threshold values become available. For now, it captures the logic of the decision tree clearly and concisely.
