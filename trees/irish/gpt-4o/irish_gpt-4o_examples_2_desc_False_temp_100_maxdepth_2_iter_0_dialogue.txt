```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision node 1: Educational level attained <= 5
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Decision node 2: Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] in [1, 2]  # Checking if it's secondary or vocational
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken
    else:
        # Decision node 2: Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Checking if it's secondary
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {'Sex': 0, 'DVRT': 25, 'Educational_level': 6, 'Prestige_score': 15, 'Type_school': 1}
# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 5.
2. If **Node 0** is `True` (meaning `Educational_level` <= 5):
   - **Node 1**: Checks if `Type_school` is 'secondary' (1) or 'vocational' (2).
     - If True, predicts `1` (certificate is taken).
     - If False, predicts `0` (certificate not taken).
3. If **Node 0** is `False` (meaning `Educational_level` > 5):
   - **Node 1**: Checks if `Type_school` is 'secondary' (1).
     - If True, predicts `1` (certificate is taken).
     - If False, predicts `0` (certificate not taken).

The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which includes all the features. It evaluates the conditions at each node, stores the condition results in the `nodes` list, and returns the final prediction along with the `nodes` list.
