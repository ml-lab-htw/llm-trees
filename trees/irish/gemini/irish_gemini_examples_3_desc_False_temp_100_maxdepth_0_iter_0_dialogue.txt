    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4  # Primary/Junior cycle incomplete or less
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0 # Primary terminal leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:

                prediction = 1  # Certificate (Higher DVRT)

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  I've replaced the vague thresholds with concrete values (4, 80, 90, 10). These are still illustrative but provide a better understanding of how the tree might function.  In a real application, these would be learned from data.
* **Educational Level Handling:** The first split is based on `Educational_level` <= 4. This effectively groups together primary school leavers and those who haven't completed junior cycle, indicating a lower likelihood of a leaving certificate.
* **Type of School Integration:** `Type_school` is used directly.  The condition `X["Type_school"] == 0` corresponds to "primary_terminal_leaver".
* **DVRT and Prestige Interaction:** The tree now reflects the interaction between DVRT and parental prestige.  At higher educational levels, prestige becomes a stronger factor.  At lower levels, DVRT plays a more prominent role.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree has been slightly simplified to improve readability and logic, while still capturing the core relationships we expect to see.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 75,
    'Educational_level': 3,
    'Prestige_score': 8,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False, True, True]


example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 95,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, False, False]

```


This revised function and explanation provides a clearer, more functional, and better-explained solution to the problem of predicting school leaving certificate attainment. Remember that this is a hypothetical tree based on general knowledge.  A true decision tree would be derived from data using machine learning algorithms.
