    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 60  # Example Drumcondra threshold
    nodes[3] = X["Type_school"] == 1  # Secondary school terminal leaver

        if nodes[2]:

        else:
            prediction = 1  # Higher DVRT, more likely certificate
    else:  # Higher educational levels (9-10)
        if nodes[3] or X["Type_school"] == 2: # Secondary or vocational, assuming vocational completion
            prediction = 1

**Explanation and Refinements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've replaced placeholder thresholds with more concrete values.  `Educational_level <= 4` captures primary and early secondary incomplete levels. `Educational_level <= 8` extends to senior cycle incomplete. A `DVRT` score of 60 is used as a hypothetical dividing line (adjust based on data distribution).
* **Node Structure:** The tree structure is simplified based on the prioritized features.  We first check `Educational_level`, then `DVRT` for intermediate levels, and finally `Type_school` for higher levels.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The code directly uses the numerical encoding provided for the features.  This assumes the input `X` dictionary will have keys like "Educational_level", "DVRT", "Type_school" with values corresponding to the given encoding.
* **Reduced Nodes:** The number of nodes in the `nodes` list is adjusted to match the actual decision points in the simplified tree structure.



**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 75,
    'Educational_level': 9,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1,  # Secondary school leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected Output (with this example data):
# Prediction: 1
# Nodes: [False, False, False, True] 
```


This revised code provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree, incorporating the specific feature encodings and returning the prediction along with the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember that the effectiveness of this tree depends entirely on the quality and representativeness of the data used to determine the actual thresholds and splits in a real-world application. Using a machine learning library to train a decision tree on real data is highly recommended for better accuracy and generalization.
