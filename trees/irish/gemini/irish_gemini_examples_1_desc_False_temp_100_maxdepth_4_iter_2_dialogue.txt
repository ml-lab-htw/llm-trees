**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  Meaningful threshold values (5, 80, 10) are used based on the likely impact of these features. These are still hypothetical but provide a more concrete example.
* **Encoding Alignment:**  The code uses the specified encoding for features (e.g., 0 for primary_terminal_leaver in `Type_school`).
* **Simplified Structure:**  The `if/else` structure is streamlined to directly reflect the decision tree's branches.
* **Example Usage:**  Added an example dictionary to show how to use the `predict` function.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic at each branch, making the code more understandable.


This improved function provides a clearer, more functional representation of the decision tree logic while adhering to the specified format and feature encoding.  Remember, the actual effectiveness of this tree depends on the real-world data used to train a true decision tree model.
