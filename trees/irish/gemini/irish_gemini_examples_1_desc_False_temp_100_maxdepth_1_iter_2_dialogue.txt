```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Primary terminal leaver implies no certificate

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

This function directly implements the "Type of School" logic discussed previously.  The threshold is straightforward:

* **`X["Type_school"] == 0`**: This checks if the student is a primary terminal leaver.  As defined in the feature encoding, `0` corresponds to "primary_terminal_leaver". This group, by definition, would not have attained a school leaving certificate.

This single-node decision tree offers a simple but effective classification based on the provided information. It avoids arbitrary thresholds for other features like the DVRT score, which would require training data to determine optimally.  This aligns with the requirement for a depth-1 tree and makes the most of the available feature information without introducing unjustified assumptions.
