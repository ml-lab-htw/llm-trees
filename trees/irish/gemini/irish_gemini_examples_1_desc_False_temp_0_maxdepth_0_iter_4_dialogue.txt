```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Adjusted number of nodes based on the decision tree

    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4  # Using a reasonable threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0 # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 60 # Using a reasonable threshold for DVRT


    if nodes[0]: # Educational_level <= 4
        if nodes[1]: # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0 # No Certificate
        else:  # Not primary terminal leaver
            if nodes[2]:  # DVRT <= 60
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else: # DVRT > 60
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
    else: # Educational_level > 4
        if nodes[1]: # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
            prediction = 0 # No Certificate
        else: # Not primary terminal leaver
            prediction = 1 # Certificate
            
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with more concrete values:
    * `Educational_level <= 4`: This separates those who likely haven't completed basic secondary education (assuming levels align with years of schooling).
    * `DVRT <= 60`: This represents a hypothetical score below which academic difficulties might prevent certificate attainment.  The actual optimal threshold would depend on the data distribution.
* **Node Count:** The `nodes` list is now initialized to the correct size (3) based on the number of decision nodes in the tree.
* **Type_school Encoding:** The code uses the given encoding for the `Type_school` feature (0 = primary_terminal_leaver).
* **Clarity:** The code is structured to closely mirror the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 3,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 70,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 10,
    'Type_school': 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")

```


This function provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes, allowing you to see the path taken through the decision tree for a given input.  Remember that the effectiveness of this tree depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the training data used to derive its structure.
