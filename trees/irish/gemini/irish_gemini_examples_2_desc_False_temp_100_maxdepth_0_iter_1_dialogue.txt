def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Type of school is the most important differentiator
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Primary terminal leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Leaving Certificate
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 8 # Not yet reached a late stage of secondary school

        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 45  # Lower DVRT score

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Higher probability of no Leaving Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Higher probability of Leaving Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Very high probability of Leaving Certificate

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`X["Type_school"] == 0`:**  This directly checks if the student is in a primary terminal program.  If so, they will not receive a leaving certificate.
* **`X["Educational_level"] <= 8`:** This checks if the student has progressed beyond the junior cycle of secondary school. If they're in senior cycle (9 or 10) or have completed 3rd level, it's highly likely they received a leaving certificate.
* **`X["DVRT"] <= 45`:** This uses a DVRT score of 45 as a dividing line.  This is a reasonable estimate, assuming the DVRT scores are standardized in some way.  A lower score suggests a higher risk of not completing secondary school, especially when combined with not having reached a higher educational level.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, None]


example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 30,
    'Educational_level': 7,
    'Prestige_score': 5,
    'Type_school': 0,
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}") # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}") # Output: Nodes: [True, None, None]

example_student3 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 30,
    'Educational_level': 3,
    'Prestige_score': 5,
    'Type_school': 1,
}

prediction3, nodes3 = predict(example_student3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction3}") # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes3}") # Output: Nodes: [False, True, True]


```



It's crucial to remember that these thresholds and the structure of the tree are just examples.  With real data, you would use a machine learning library to train a decision tree model, which would determine the optimal thresholds and branching structure based on the data itself.  The model would also give you measures of its performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) so you can evaluate its effectiveness.
