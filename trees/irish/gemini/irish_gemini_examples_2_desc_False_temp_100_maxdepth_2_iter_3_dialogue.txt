```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Threshold chosen based on Junior/Senior cycle completion 
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 80  # Threshold needs data analysis, but assuming average score is around 80

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Didn't complete Junior cycle and low DVRT likely means no certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Didn't complete Junior cycle but high DVRT might suggest other factors
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Completing Senior cycle generally implies obtaining the certificate

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:**  
   - `Educational_level` is chosen as the root node because intuitively, completing a higher level of education is strongly correlated with obtaining a school leaving certificate.  
   - `DVRT` is chosen for the second level as it's a measure of academic aptitude, which is likely relevant.

2. **Threshold Selection:**
   - For `Educational_level`, 5 is chosen as a split point. This separates those who haven't completed the Junior cycle (levels 3-7) from those who have (levels 0-2 and 8-10). 
   - For `DVRT`, 80 is a placeholder.  **This needs to be adjusted based on data analysis. You'll want to find a DVRT score that best separates those who obtained the certificate from those who didn't.**

3. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The `if-else` statements implement the decision logic of the tree.  
   - The comments within the code explain the reasoning behind each prediction.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:**  This tree is based on assumptions about your data.  To make it truly effective, you need to analyze your data and find the optimal features and thresholds. 
* **Placeholder Threshold:**  The `DVRT` threshold of 80 is a placeholder.  You **must** replace it with a value derived from your data analysis.
* **Limited Depth:** A depth-2 tree might be too simple for this problem.  Consider experimenting with greater depths once you have real data.
