```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Using Type_school as the first split, as it's likely a strong indicator
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Primary terminal leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Primary terminal leavers are unlikely to have the certificate
    else:
        # If not a primary terminal leaver, use DVRT score
        nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] > 85 # Hypothetical threshold - needs data to determine real value

        if nodes[1]:  # High DVRT score
            # Check Educational Level
            nodes[2] = X["Educational_level"] >= 8  # Hypothetical threshold

            if nodes[2]:  # High Educational Level
                prediction = 1  # Likely has certificate
            else:
                 prediction = 1 # Assuming some will still have the certificate
        else: # Low DVRT score
            nodes[3] = X["Prestige_score"] > 15  # Hypothetical threshold

            if nodes[3]:  # High prestige score might still lead to a certificate
                prediction = 1  # possibly has certificate (more features needed)
            else: # Low Prestige Score
                prediction = 0  # Unlikely to have certificate

    return prediction, nodes


```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds.  To determine accurate thresholds, you'll need a dataset and train a decision tree algorithm on it.  The algorithm will find the optimal splits based on the data.

2. **Feature Order:** The order of the features (Type_school, DVRT, Educational_level, Prestige_score) is based on my hypothetical understanding of their importance.  A real decision tree algorithm would determine this order based on information gain or Gini impurity.

3. **Simplified Structure:** I simplified the tree structure compared to my initial conceptual outline.  The complexity of the tree should be appropriate for the data and avoid overfitting.  With more data and a trained model, the structure could be refined.

4. **Error Handling:** The function doesn't explicitly handle potential errors (e.g., missing features).  In a production setting, adding error handling would be important.

5. **Categorical Features:** The function handles the categorical features "Type_school" and "Educational_level" directly by comparing them to specific values.  More advanced techniques like one-hot encoding can be used for categorical features with many values.

**How to Use the Function:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 95,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (likely has certificate)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")      # Output: Nodes: [False, True, True, None] 
                                # Reflecting the path taken in the tree
```

**Next Steps:**

* **Get Real Data:** The most crucial step is to obtain a dataset with these features and the target variable (certificate attainment).
* **Train a Decision Tree Model:** Use a library like scikit-learn in Python to train a decision tree classifier on your data.  This will automatically determine the best tree structure, feature order, and thresholds.
* **Evaluate and Refine:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics and refine it as needed (e.g., by adjusting parameters or pruning the tree).


This improved answer provides a functional Python implementation and clarifies the necessary steps to build a real-world decision tree model.  Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values determined from your training data.
