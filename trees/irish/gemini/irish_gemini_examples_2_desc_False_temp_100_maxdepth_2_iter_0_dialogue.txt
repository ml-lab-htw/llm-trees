I can help you build a decision tree classifier function based on your provided features and target. 

Since you haven't provided specific data to determine the most important features or optimal thresholds, I'm going to make some educated guesses based on common knowledge about educational attainment.  **These are just for illustration; you'll want to use a decision tree algorithm with your data to find the best features and thresholds.**

**Assumptions:**

* **Educational_level is likely a strong predictor:** Higher educational attainment might correlate with getting the school leaving certificate.
* **Type_school could be relevant:**  Students in certain school types might be more likely to pursue the certificate.

**Example Decision Tree Function (Depth 2):**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1:  Educational level above Junior cycle?
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 4 
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2:  Secondary school type? (assuming higher likelihood)
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1  
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  
        else:
            prediction = 0  
    else:
        prediction = 1 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Node 1 (Root):** Checks if "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 4. This splits those who didn't complete a significant portion of secondary education (assuming the ordering of levels you provided implies increasing attainment). 
2. **Node 2 (Left Branch):** If "Educational_level" is low, this node further checks if "Type_school" is 1 (secondary_terminal_leaver).  We're assuming this group might be more likely to have the certificate even with lower overall attainment.
3. **Right Branch:** If "Educational_level" is higher than 4, we predict they got the certificate (assuming higher attainment generally leads to the certificate).

**Important Notes:**

* This is a simplified example!  You **need** real data and a decision tree algorithm to find the best features, thresholds, and relationships for accurate predictions. 
* Consider exploring different feature combinations and thresholds during tree construction.
* Evaluate your decision tree's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) and a separate test dataset.
