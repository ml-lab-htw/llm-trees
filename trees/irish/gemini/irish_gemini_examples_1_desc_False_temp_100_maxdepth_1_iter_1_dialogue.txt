```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Assuming 7 is the minimum level for the certificate. Adjust as needed.

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Did not attain certificate
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Attained certificate
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification of Threshold:**

The provided `Educational_level` feature has encoded values representing different educational milestones. We need a threshold to separate those who likely *haven't* achieved the school leaving certificate from those who likely *have*.

I've chosen `7` (Primary_terminal_leaver) as the initial threshold based on the following logic:

* **Levels 0-6:**  These levels (3rd_level_complete, 3rd_level_incomplete, ?, Junior_cycle_incomplete, Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver) likely represent incomplete secondary education or earlier stages.  It's reasonable to assume individuals at these levels generally haven't yet obtained a school leaving certificate.
* **Levels 8-10:** These levels (Senior_cycle_incomplete, Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver) represent later stages of secondary education. It's highly probable that individuals at these levels have or are close to obtaining the certificate.

Therefore, 7 seems a reasonable dividing line.  However, this is a crucial parameter that should be refined using actual training data and performance evaluation.  If available, data on which educational levels correspond to certificate attainment would allow for determining the optimal threshold.  It's possible the threshold should be higher (e.g., 9 or 10) depending on the specific requirements for the certificate.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student1 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 95,
    'Educational_level': 5,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1,
}

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(example_student1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}") # Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True]


example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 110,
    'Educational_level': 10, # Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 22,
    'Type_school': 1,
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}, Nodes: {nodes2}") # Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [False]
```
