def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 92.5  
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6.5 
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0 
    else:
        prediction = 1 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** We initialize a list called `nodes` with a size of 2 (representing the maximum of two decision nodes for a depth of 2) and set each element to `None`. This list will store the truth values of our decision nodes.
2. **Decision Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0] = X["DVRT"] <= 92.5`: This represents the first decision node, checking if the "DVRT" score is less than or equal to 92.5. This threshold is a placeholder and should be determined from your data analysis (e.g., using a decision tree learning algorithm).
   - `nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6.5`:  This is the second decision node (used only if the first condition is True), checking if the "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 6.5. Again, this threshold is a placeholder.
3. **Prediction Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree's logic:
   - If `nodes[0]` is True (DVRT <= 92.5):
      - We further check `nodes[1]`. If True (Educational_level <= 6.5), we predict `1` (school leaving certificate taken), else `0` (not taken).
   - If `nodes[0]` is False (DVRT > 92.5): We predict `1` (school leaving certificate taken). 
4. **Return:** The function returns the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list containing the truth values of the decision nodes. 

**Important Notes:**

- **Thresholds:** The thresholds (92.5 for DVRT and 6.5 for Educational_level) are placeholders. You need to analyze your data and use a decision tree learning algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) to find the most appropriate thresholds that best split your data to classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.
- **Feature Selection:** I have used "DVRT" and "Educational_level" as features in this example. You might need to experiment with different features and use feature importance scores from your decision tree algorithm to select the most relevant ones for your model.
