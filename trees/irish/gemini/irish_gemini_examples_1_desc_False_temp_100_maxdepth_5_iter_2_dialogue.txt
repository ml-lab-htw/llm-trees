**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  Numeric thresholds are used for `Educational_level`, `DVRT`, and `Prestige_score`.  These are still somewhat arbitrary but provide a more concrete example.
* **Encoding Alignment:** The code uses the provided feature encodings (0, 1, 2 for `Type_school`, etc.)
* **Logical Structure:** The `if/else` structure mirrors the decision tree logic.
* **Completeness:** I've added a check for `Type_school == 0` (primary_terminal_leaver) even in the `Educational_level > 5` branch, for completeness, even though it's logically redundant based on the initial split.  In a real-world scenario, such redundancy might be pruned away during tree construction.
* **No Sex Feature:**  In this hypothetical tree, the `Sex` feature isn't used.  A real model trained on data might reveal a relationship, but we don't have the information to include it here meaningfully.

**How to Use:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 65,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 12,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Certificate)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [False, False, False, True, False]
```


This improved function provides a more concrete and usable example of a decision tree prediction function.  Remember, this is still a hypothetical example. With real data and a machine learning library, the tree structure and thresholds would be learned automatically, resulting in a much more accurate and robust model.
