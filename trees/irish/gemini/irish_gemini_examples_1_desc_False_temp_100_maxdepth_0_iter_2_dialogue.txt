def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Primary terminal leaver
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Less than or equal to Junior Cycle Incomplete/Terminal Leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate (Primary terminal leavers)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate (Lower educational attainment)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate (Higher educational attainment)

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns the predicted class (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes. It uses the "Type_school" and "Educational_level" features as described in the provided decision tree logic.  The thresholds (0 for Type_school and 7 for Educational_level) are chosen based on the provided feature descriptions, reflecting the assumption that primary terminal leavers and those with lower educational attainment are less likely to have a leaving certificate.
