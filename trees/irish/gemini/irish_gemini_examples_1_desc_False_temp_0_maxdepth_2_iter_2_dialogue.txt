**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Encoding Alignment:** The provided feature encodings are used directly in the function.  "Type_school" == 0 corresponds to "primary_terminal_leaver".

2. **Threshold Selection:**  For "Educational_level," a threshold of 8 (corresponding to "Senior_cycle_incomplete") is used.  Students below this level are less likely to have the certificate.  This is a reasonable assumption but would ideally be determined by analyzing real data.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code uses more descriptive variable names and comments to make the logic easier to follow.

4. **Testability:** Example usage is included to demonstrate how to use the function and interpret the output.


This refined function adheres to the requested format, provides a more robust implementation, and incorporates best practices for clarity and maintainability. It is important to emphasize again that the chosen threshold and the general performance of this decision tree are heavily dependent on the real-world data and should be evaluated and adjusted accordingly.
