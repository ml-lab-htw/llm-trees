    if nodes[0]:

```


**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Threshold Selection:** The threshold for `Educational_level` is set to 7. This is a reasoned choice because the `Educational_level` categories coded 8, 9, and 10 (Senior_cycle_incomplete and Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver) clearly suggest a higher likelihood of having attained the school leaving certificate compared to levels below (e.g., Primary_terminal_leaver or Junior_cycle_incomplete/terminal_leaver).

2. **Depth 1:** The function adheres to the depth-1 constraint, using only a single decision node.

3. **Truth Values:** The `nodes` list stores the truth value of the condition at the decision node (True if the condition is met, False otherwise). This provides transparency into the decision-making process.

4. **Feature Usage:** The function correctly uses the specified feature key "Educational_level".

5. **Target Encoding:** The prediction is encoded as 0 (not attained) and 1 (attained), consistent with the provided target encoding.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 100,
    'Educational_level': 10,  # Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1,  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected output:
# Prediction: 1
# Nodes: [True]


example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 80,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Primary_terminal_leaver
    'Prestige_score': 10,
    'Type_school': 0, # primary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected output:
# Prediction: 0
# Nodes: [False]
```


This improved version provides a more robust and interpretable solution, adhering to the specified requirements and incorporating domain knowledge for a more meaningful threshold. Remember that optimal performance would require training on actual data and potentially using a more complex model.
