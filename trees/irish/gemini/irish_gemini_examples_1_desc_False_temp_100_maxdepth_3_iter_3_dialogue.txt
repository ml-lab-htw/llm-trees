**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've provided more concrete threshold values.  The threshold of 4 for `Educational_level` remains a critical assumption. The `DVRT` threshold of 70 is another assumption, and ideally, would be determined from data analysis (e.g., finding a score that best separates those who attained the certificate from those who didn't).
* **Feature Encoding:** The function now uses the specified encodings for the categorical features (`Type_school`).
* **Testability:** The code now includes example usage with sample student data and print statements to demonstrate the output.
* **Real-World Application:**  To apply this effectively, you would need a dataset of student records with these features and the corresponding certificate attainment outcome (0 or 1).  You'd then train a decision tree model using a library like scikit-learn, which would automatically determine the optimal tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds based on the data. This code provides a simplified, illustrative example.
