**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`Educational_level <= 5`:**  Educational levels below or equal to "Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school" (5) are assumed to be less likely to lead to a school leaving certificate.  This threshold separates those who likely haven't progressed far enough in secondary education from those who have.
* **`Type_school == 0`:** This checks if the student is in a primary terminal leaver school (encoded as 0).  Students in these schools typically do not pursue a school leaving certificate.


**Example Usage:**

```python
student_data = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 90,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

In this example, the prediction would be 1 (certificate attained) because the educational level is greater than 5 and the school type is not primary terminal leaver.  The `nodes` list would be `[False, False]`.


Another example:

```python
student_data = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 70,
    'Educational_level': 7,
    'Prestige_score': 10,
    'Type_school': 0 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```
In this case, even though the `Educational_level` is greater than 5, the `Type_school` is 0 (primary terminal leaver), therefore the prediction will be 0 and the `nodes` list would be `[False, True]`.

This function fulfills the requirements, providing both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes. Remember that these thresholds are examples and might need adjustments based on the real data distribution.  Using a decision tree learning algorithm on a real dataset will give you the optimal thresholds.
