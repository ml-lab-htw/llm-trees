def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Primary terminal leaver
    nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] <= 8  # Below or equal to Senior Cycle Incomplete
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 60  # Below or equal to a Drumcondra score of 60 (hypothetical)


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage (replace with your actual feature values):
example_student = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 70,
    'Educational_level': 9,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1 
}

prediction, node_values = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Certificate)
print(f"Node Values: {node_values}") # Output: [False, False, False]


example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 50,
    'Educational_level': 7,
    'Prestige_score': 5,
    'Type_school': 0
}

prediction2, node_values2 = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: 0 (No Certificate)
print(f"Node Values: {node_values2}") # Output: [True, True, True]

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've replaced placeholder thresholds with more concrete values (e.g., `DVRT <= 60`).  These are still *hypothetical* and should be determined by analyzing actual data.  The Drumcondra score of 60 is chosen as a potential indicator of below-average performance, potentially hindering certificate attainment.
* **Encoding:** The code now uses the provided feature encoding (0/1 for sex, 0-10 for educational level, 0-2 for school type).
* **Node Values:**  The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values of the decision tree's conditions for a given input.
* **Clarity:** The code is more clearly structured and commented.

**Using with Real Data and Scikit-learn:**

This function demonstrates the decision tree logic. However, for real-world applications, use a machine learning library like scikit-learn. This library handles data splitting, model training, optimization, and evaluation. You would provide your data as a Pandas DataFrame or NumPy array, and scikit-learn would build a more robust and accurate decision tree model.  You wouldn't need to manually create the `predict` function.  Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` class provides the necessary functionality.
