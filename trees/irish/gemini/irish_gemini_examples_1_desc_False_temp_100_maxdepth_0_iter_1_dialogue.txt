```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] >= 8  # Threshold for sufficient educational attainment

    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1 # 1 represents "secondary_terminal_leaver"
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate likely attained
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely not in a certificate-granting track
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Insufficient educational attainment for certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function directly implements the decision tree logic discussed previously, using the provided feature names and encodings.  The threshold for `Educational_level` is set to 8, representing "Senior_cycle_incomplete" and above as likely sufficient for a certificate. The `Type_school` check specifically looks for the "secondary_terminal_leaver" encoding (1) to predict certificate attainment.  The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each level of the tree.
