**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clear Thresholds:**  Meaningful thresholds are added based on reasonable assumptions (e.g., DVRT <= 80 as a potential indicator of not completing secondary school, Prestige_score <= 10 indicating lower socioeconomic status).
* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the provided feature encodings directly.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The decision tree logic is streamlined for readability and efficiency.  The nesting reflects the tree structure.
* **Type Hinting:** Type hinting (`X: dict`) improves code clarity.
* **No Placeholders:**  All threshold values are filled in with plausible values.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 75,
    'Educational_level': 7,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected output:
# Prediction: 0
# Nodes: [True, True, True, False]



X = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 95,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected output:
# Prediction: 1
# Nodes: [False, False, False, False]

```


This improved function provides a working example based on the provided features and encoding, ready to be tested and further refined with real data.  Remember that the performance of this tree depends entirely on the quality and representativeness of the data used to derive it (which in this case is hypothetical). Using a machine learning library like scikit-learn with real data is the correct way to build a robust decision tree classifier.
