**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  The threshold for `Educational_level` is set to 7, effectively separating "Primary_terminal_leaver" and below from the rest. This makes intuitive sense as completing primary school doesn't usually grant a leaving certificate.  The second split checks if the school type is `primary_terminal_leaver`.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the numerical encoding provided for `Type_school` (0, 1, 2).
* **Missing Data Handling:** The current code assumes no missing data.  In a real-world application, you'd need to handle missing values in the input features.  Strategies include imputation (filling in missing values with the mean, median, or a more sophisticated method), or creating a separate branch in the decision tree for missing values.
* **Data-Driven Optimization:** This function is still based on assumptions.  With a real dataset, you could train a decision tree classifier (e.g., using scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`) to find the optimal split points and feature order, which would likely lead to a more accurate model. You could also explore different depth limits beyond 2.



This improved function provides a more complete and robust example, although it still relies on some assumptions due to the lack of real training data.  It also demonstrates how to encode the decision tree logic into a Python function and return the prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
