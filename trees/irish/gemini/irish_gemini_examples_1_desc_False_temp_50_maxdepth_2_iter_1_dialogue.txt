**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Type_school Encoding:** The provided encoding for `Type_school` is used directly in the function.
* **Educational_level Threshold:** I've set the threshold for `Educational_level` to 7. This means if someone is not a primary school leaver but has an educational level less than or equal to 7 (e.g., Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver or Primary_terminal_leaver, even if they are attending vocational or secondary school), they are predicted not to have a leaving certificate.  This threshold is a reasonable starting point, but with real data, a more accurate value could be learned.
* **Missing Features:** The other features (`Sex`, `DVRT`, `Prestige_score`) are not used in this depth-2 tree. A more complex tree or a different model could incorporate them.
* **Testability:** I've added example usage to demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the output.  This makes the code more readily testable with different student profiles.




This improved version is now more aligned with the provided feature encodings and includes a more reasonable threshold for `Educational_level`, making it more practical for use with actual data.  Remember that optimal thresholds and feature importance should be determined with a data-driven approach using a training dataset.
