```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Educational level threshold
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Hypothetical DVRT threshold (adjust as needed)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Didn't reach sufficient educational level
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Low DVRT despite continuing education
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Higher DVRT and continued education

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage (replace with your actual feature values):
example_student = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 70,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")


example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 95,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 22,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction 2: {prediction2}")
print(f"Nodes 2: {nodes2}")

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added a hypothetical threshold for the DVRT (85). This would need to be determined from data analysis.  A common approach is to use the median or another quantile as an initial guess.
* **Educational Level:** The threshold of 5 for `Educational_level` reflects the assumption that levels below this indicate a higher likelihood of not completing the leaving certificate. Again, this would need to be validated with data.
* **Missing Features:**  The other features (Sex, Prestige_score, Type_school) are not used in this simplified tree due to the depth restriction.  If the depth were increased, these could be incorporated based on their importance.
* **Real-World Application:** Remember, this function represents a *simplified* decision tree.  In a real application, you would use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn in Python) to train a decision tree classifier on a dataset.  The library would handle feature selection, threshold optimization, and tree construction automatically.  The resulting tree would likely be more complex and accurate.
