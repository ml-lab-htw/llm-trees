**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Thresholds:** The decision tree now uses explicit comparisons to the encoded values for `Educational_level` and `Type_school`, making the logic easier to follow.  The primary split is now at `Educational_level` <= 7, which includes `Primary_terminal_leaver` (7) and all levels below it.

2. **Handles Edge Cases:**  The tree now specifically considers the unusual case where `Educational_level` is > 7 but `Type_school` is `primary_terminal_leaver`.  Although unlikely, it's better to handle this explicitly.

3. **Consistent Encoding:** The code now uses the provided numerical encodings for the features, ensuring consistency.

4. **Docstring:**  A docstring has been added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.


**Example Usage:**

```python
student1 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 90,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Primary_terminal_leaver
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0 # primary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


student2 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 110,
    'Educational_level': 10, # Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 22,
    'Type_school': 1 # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False]


```


This improved function provides a more robust and understandable implementation of the hypothetical decision tree, using the provided feature encodings and handling potential edge cases. Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* tree.  Real data is needed to train a truly accurate model.
