**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable placeholder values for the DVRT thresholds (80 for the low threshold and 100 for the moderate threshold). These are just examples; real-world values would be learned from data.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now has 4 entries, corresponding to the conditions in the `if` statements.  Each entry is a boolean value representing whether the condition is met.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the specified feature encodings (e.g., 0 for female, 1 for male; numeric values for `Educational_level` and `Type_school`).
* **Simplified Structure:**  I've simplified the nested `if` structure a bit to make the code more readable, while preserving the core logic of the decision tree. The key is that the tree structure is directly reflected in the nested conditional statements.
* **Example Usage:** I've included two example dictionaries to demonstrate how to use the `predict` function and interpret its output.

This revised code provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree, capturing the logic and returning both the prediction and the intermediate node values. Remember, this is still a hypothetical tree. Its accuracy and effectiveness would depend heavily on the quality and representativeness of the training data used to determine the real thresholds and branching structure.
