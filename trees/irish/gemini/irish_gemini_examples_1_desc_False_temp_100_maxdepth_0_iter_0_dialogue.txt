```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 5  # Junior cycle or below not likely to have certificate
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 40  # Assuming 40 is a reasonable threshold on this test


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0 #  Low education level, likely no certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Higher education but low test score, potentially no certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Higher education and good test score, likely has certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function uses the `Educational_level` and `DVRT` features, as hypothesized earlier, to make a prediction. It also returns the list `nodes`, reflecting the truth values of the conditions at each level of the simplified decision tree.  Remember, without real data to train on and validate against, this remains a hypothetical example and the thresholds are educated guesses.  The thresholds chosen (5 for `Educational_level` and 40 for `DVRT`) attempt to reflect logical cutoffs related to likely certificate attainment based on education progression and assumed test performance.  However, these would need adjustment with actual data.
