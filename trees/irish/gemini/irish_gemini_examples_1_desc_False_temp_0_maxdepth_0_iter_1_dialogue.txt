**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Adjustments:** The DVRT threshold is adjusted from 50 to 45 as an example. These would ideally be determined by training a model on actual data.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is structured to closely mirror the decision tree's logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list accurately captures the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes, as requested.
* **Error Handling (Optional):**  For a production-ready function, you might add error handling to check for missing features or invalid input types in the `X` dictionary.



**Example Usage:**

```python
student_data = {
    'Sex': 1, 
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 8, 
    'Prestige_score': 15, 
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, node_values = predict(student_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Certificate)
print(f"Node Values: {node_values}") # Output: Node Values: [False, False, None, False] (Reflects the path taken in the tree)

student_data2 = {
    'Sex': 0, 
    'DVRT': 30,
    'Educational_level': 5, 
    'Prestige_score': 8, 
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction2, node_values2 = predict(student_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Certificate)
print(f"Node Values: {node_values2}") # Output: Node Values: [False, True, True, None]
