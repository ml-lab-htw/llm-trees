def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts the likelihood of a student obtaining their school leaving certificate.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the following features:
      - 'Sex': Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
      - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
      - 'Educational_level': Educational level attained (see description)
      - 'Prestige_score': Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
      - 'Type_school': Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - prediction: The predicted class (0 = no certificate, 1 = certificate)
      - nodes: A list representing the truth values of the decision nodes.

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:** For this decision tree, I've prioritized 'Educational_level', 'DVRT', and 'Prestige_score'. These features are likely to have a significant impact on whether a student completes their schooling and receives a leaving certificate.  

2. **Threshold Selection:**  The thresholds (6 for 'Educational_level', 90 for 'DVRT', and 15 for 'Prestige_score') are placeholders. To obtain more accurate and meaningful thresholds, you would ideally analyze the data distribution and relationship between these features and the target variable.

3. **Decision Logic:** The tree prioritizes 'Educational_level' as the root node, as it's a strong indicator of certificate attainment.  It then considers a combination of 'DVRT' and 'Prestige_score' to further refine the prediction.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example.  The real power of a decision tree comes from training it on real data to discover the most relevant features and optimal decision boundaries.
