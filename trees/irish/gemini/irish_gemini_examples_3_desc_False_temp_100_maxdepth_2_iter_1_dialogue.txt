    Predicts school leaving certificate attainment based on student features.

    Args:
      X (dict): Dictionary of student features:
        - 'Sex': 0 (female) or 1 (male)
        - 'DVRT': Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level': Encoded educational level (0-10)
        - 'Prestige_score': Father's occupation prestige score (0-28)
        - 'Type_school': 0 (primary), 1 (secondary), or 2 (vocational)

    Returns:
      tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): 0 (certificate not taken) or 1 (certificate taken)

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` of features as input and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the conditions in the inner nodes.

2. **Nodes:** The `nodes` list is initialized with `None` values. We then set the values based on the decision tree's logic. 

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - **Node 0 (Educational_level):** We use `X['Educational_level'] <= 6` as a split. This assumes that students with education levels encoded as 7 or higher are more likely to have completed their school leaving certificate.
   - **Node 1 (Type_school):** For those with lower educational attainment (Node 0 is True), we further split based on school type.  If `X['Type_school'] == 0` (primary terminal leaver), they are less likely to have the certificate.

4. **Prediction:**  The `if-else` statements at the end implement the decision tree's prediction logic based on the truth values of the nodes.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds (`<= 6` for education level) are illustrative.  You'll need to analyze your data to determine the most appropriate thresholds that best separate the classes (certificate taken/not taken).
* **Feature Importance:** The chosen features (education level and school type) are based on common sense assumptions.  A machine learning algorithm trained on your data would provide a more data-driven selection of important features.
* **Data Required:**  This function is designed to work with your specific feature encoding. You'll need a labeled dataset to train a real decision tree model and determine the most accurate thresholds and feature splits.
