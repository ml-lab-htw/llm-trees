**Explanation and Refinements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've set thresholds for DVRT (40) and Prestige Score (10). These are illustrative and would need to be tuned based on real-world data analysis.
* **Educational Level:**  This remains the primary splitting factor.  Students with lower levels (<= 5) face greater challenges.
* **Type of School:**  The logic incorporates the different types of schools and their potential impact on certificate attainment, particularly "primary_terminal_leaver".
* **DVRT and Prestige Score:** These secondary factors refine the prediction within branches of the tree.
* **Encoding:** The code aligns with the specified feature encoding (0, 1, 2 for Type_school; 0-10 for Educational_level, etc.).


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 35,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Primary_terminal_leaver
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 10,  # Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

This improved version provides a functional Python implementation, incorporating the provided feature details and encoding, and offering more specific logic based on reasonable assumptions.  Remember that real-world data and a proper training process are essential for building a truly effective model.
