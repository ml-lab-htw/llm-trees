**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Thresholds:**  The code now uses more descriptive thresholds aligned with the educational levels and school types.

2. **Type Handling:**  Handles the categorical nature of `Type_school` appropriately.

3. **Example Usage:**  Includes example usage to demonstrate how to call the function.

4. **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic behind the thresholds and predictions.

5. **Encoding Alignment:** Uses the provided feature encoding (0/1 for `Sex`, numerical values for `Educational_level` and `Type_school`, etc.).



This revised function provides a more accurate and interpretable decision tree, albeit still a simplified one.  With a real dataset, a machine learning library would optimize the thresholds and potentially use more features for even better performance.
