**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Number of Nodes:** The number of `nodes` in the list is adjusted to match the actual number of decision nodes in the tree.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  I've added more specific thresholds based on reasonable assumptions. For instance, a DVRT score of 70 might be considered a reasonable split point (this would ideally be determined from data analysis).  A prestige score of 10 is used as a hypothetical threshold. The educational level of 7 (Primary_terminal_leaver) acts as a critical split.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code now directly uses the provided feature encoding (0, 1, 2 for school type, etc.).
* **Simplified Structure:**  The `if/else` structure is refined to more closely reflect the decision tree logic.
* **Example Usage:** The example at the end demonstrates how to use the `predict` function with a sample feature dictionary.

**Important Note:**  This function is still a *simplified* example. A real-world model would likely be more complex and would be trained on a dataset using a machine learning algorithm.  The thresholds and the tree structure itself would be determined by the algorithm based on the data, optimizing for prediction accuracy.
