```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] >= 10  # Assuming 10 and above indicate completion requiring leaving cert.
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 1 # 1 represents 'secondary_terminal_leaver'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Certificate attained
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely attained (in secondary school, working towards it)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely not attained (not in a certificate-granting path)

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function adheres to the specified format and uses realistic threshold values based on the provided feature descriptions. The key improvements are:

* **Correct feature names:** Uses the exact capitalization and spelling provided.
* **Clear thresholds:** Uses `>= 10` for `Educational_level`, aligning with the assumption that levels 10 and above signify leaving certificate completion.  Uses `== 1` for `Type_school` to identify secondary school terminal leavers specifically.
* **Simplified logic:**  The nested `if/else` structure clearly reflects the decision tree logic.
* **Consistent return values:** Returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values.


This function can be directly tested with a dictionary representing the features of a student. For example:

```python
student_features = {'Sex': 0, 'DVRT': 70, 'Educational_level': 8, 'Prestige_score': 15, 'Type_school': 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(student_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

student_features = {'Sex': 1, 'DVRT': 90, 'Educational_level': 10, 'Prestige_score': 20, 'Type_school': 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(student_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

student_features = {'Sex': 0, 'DVRT': 50, 'Educational_level': 7, 'Prestige_score': 10, 'Type_school': 0}
prediction, nodes = predict(student_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```


Remember that this function represents a simplified model based on assumptions.  A real-world application would require training on data to achieve accurate predictions.
