```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 9  # Using 9 as the threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0 # primary_terminal_leaver
    nodes[2] = X["DVRT"] <= 85 # Hypothetical threshold for DVRT - adjust based on data

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:  # Primary terminal leaver
            prediction = 0
        else: # Not primary terminal leaver
            if nodes[2]: # Low DVRT Score
                prediction = 0
            else: # Higher DVRT score
                prediction = 1
    else:  # Educational level > 9
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added concrete threshold values.  The `DVRT` threshold of 85 is a placeholder.  In a real application, this would be learned from the training data and might be different.  Similarly, the `Educational_level` threshold could be adjusted based on data analysis.
* **Type_school Encoding:**  The code uses the provided encoding (0 = primary_terminal_leaver).
* **Clarity:**  The code is structured to match the decision tree logic directly, making it easier to follow.
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values (0 or 1) of the decision nodes. This allows you to trace the decision path.



**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 70,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1 # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_student)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the `nodes` output might be `[True, False, True]`, indicating that the first and third conditions were met, but the second was not.  The prediction would depend on how these conditions combine in the tree logic.


To further improve this, you would need to train a real decision tree model on a dataset of student data.  This would provide the optimal thresholds and potentially reveal more complex relationships between the features and certificate attainment.  Libraries like `scikit-learn` in Python make it easy to train decision tree classifiers.  The structure and logic would be extracted from the trained model.
