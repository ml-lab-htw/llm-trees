def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6  # Threshold 6 separates lower from higher educational levels
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 90  # Hypothetical threshold for verbal reasoning score

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Likely not to obtain certificate with lower educational level
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Even with higher education, low DVRT might mean not obtaining the certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Higher education and high DVRT likely lead to obtaining the certificate 

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` list:** Initializes a list with two `None` values to store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node of our depth-2 decision tree.

2. **`nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 6`:** This represents the first decision split. Based on data exploration, we hypothesize that an "Educational_level" of 6 or less is a strong indicator of not obtaining the school leaving certificate. 
   - If the student's "Educational_level" is less than or equal to 6, `nodes[0]` is set to `True`.
   - Otherwise, `nodes[0]` is set to `False`.

3. **`nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 90`:** This represents the second decision split, but it only comes into play if `nodes[0]` is `False` (meaning the student has an "Educational_level" higher than 6). 
    - We assume (hypothetically) that a DVRT score of 90 is a dividing line. If a student has a higher "Educational_level" but scores 90 or less on the DVRT, they are still less likely to obtain the certificate.

4. **Conditional Predictions:** The `if-else` statements use the truth values in `nodes` to arrive at a prediction:
    - **`if nodes[0]: prediction = 0`:** If the "Educational_level" is low (`nodes[0]` is True), predict 0 (not obtained) regardless of the DVRT.
    - **`else:`:** If "Educational_level" is high, check the DVRT:
        -  **`if nodes[1]: prediction = 0`:**  Low DVRT despite high education, predict 0.
        - **`else: prediction = 1`:** High DVRT and high education, predict 1 (obtained).

5. **Return:** The function returns both the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, which provides insights into the decision path taken.

**Important:**  The chosen thresholds (6 for "Educational_level" and 90 for "DVRT") are examples.  You would need to analyze your actual dataset to determine the most appropriate thresholds that best split the data and maximize the predictive power of your decision tree.
