    Predicts whether a student will take their school leaving certificate based on given features.

    Args:
      X (dict): A dictionary of features:

        - 'DVRT' (int): Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
        - 'Educational_level' (int): Educational level attained (see description)

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a student.
2. **Node Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list with two elements, initially set to `None`, representing the truth values of the two inner nodes in our depth-2 decision tree.
3. **Threshold Setting (IMPORTANT):** The code currently uses placeholder thresholds for the decision tree:
    - `nodes[0] = X['DVRT'] <= 90`: This means if a student's DVRT score is less than or equal to 90, the condition is considered True (1). This threshold is arbitrary and should be replaced with a value determined from your data analysis.
    - `nodes[1] = X['Educational_level'] <= 5`: This uses the encoded educational levels. Again, the threshold of 5 is arbitrary and needs to be adjusted based on your data.
4. **Decision Logic:**  The `if-else` statements represent the decision tree logic, branching based on the truth values of the conditions in `nodes`. The current logic assumes:
    - Students with lower DVRT scores and lower educational levels are less likely to complete their certificates. 
    - Students with higher DVRT scores are more likely to complete, regardless of other factors.
5. **Prediction:**  The `prediction` variable is set to 0 (not taken) or 1 (taken) based on the decision path.
6. **Return Values:** The function returns both the `prediction` and the `nodes` list, which indicates the path taken in the decision tree.

**Before Using This Function:**

* **Replace Placeholder Thresholds:** Analyze your data to find meaningful thresholds for 'DVRT' and 'Educational_level' that effectively split the data for predicting certificate completion. 
* **Validate and Improve:** Test the function's accuracy and adjust the thresholds or decision logic as needed to create a more effective decision tree classifier.
