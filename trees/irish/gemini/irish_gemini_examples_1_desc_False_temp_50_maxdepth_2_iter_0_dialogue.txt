**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold for `Educational_level`:**  I've set the threshold to 7, which corresponds to "Primary_terminal_leaver." This makes intuitive sense: students completing only primary education wouldn't get the certificate typically associated with secondary or higher completion.
* **`Type_school` refinement:**  The second node checks if the school type is "primary_terminal_leaver." This handles cases where a student might have an `Educational_level` *slightly* above primary but is still in a primary terminal track, thus not getting the certificate.
* **Clearer Node Logic:**  The `if/else` structure reflects the decision tree logic more accurately.
* **Example Usage:**  I've added examples to demonstrate how to use the function.  Replace these with your actual data.


This refined function provides a more robust and interpretable implementation of the decision tree for predicting school leaving certificate attainment within the given constraints. Remember that the effectiveness of this model depends heavily on the training data used to derive these rules/thresholds in a real-world scenario.  You would typically train a decision tree classifier on your data rather than hardcoding these values.
