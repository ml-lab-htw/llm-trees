**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  Realistic thresholds have been added based on the provided feature descriptions and general educational expectations. For instance, an `Educational_level` less than or equal to 4 captures primary school and early junior cycle dropouts. A `Prestige_score` of 10 or less is used as a hypothetical low socio-economic indicator. The DVRT is split at the 50th percentile.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree has been slightly simplified by combining some branches where the outcome was the same (e.g., different types of early leavers).
* **Clearer Feature Usage:** The code explicitly uses the feature keys as provided (e.g., "Educational_level," "Type_school").
* **Binary Outcome:** The prediction is clearly 0 or 1, aligning with the target variable encoding.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list is populated with the truth values (True/False, which become 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node.


This improved function provides a more concrete and usable implementation of the decision tree, reflecting a more realistic scenario while adhering to the specified format and requirements. Remember that this is still a *hypothetical* tree and would require training on real data for optimal performance and accurate threshold determination. Using `scikit-learn`'s `DecisionTreeClassifier` on a real dataset is strongly recommended for any real-world application.
