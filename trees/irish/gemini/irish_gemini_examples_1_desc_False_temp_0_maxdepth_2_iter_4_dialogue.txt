**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've used a hypothetical DVRT threshold of 70.  In a real application, this threshold would be learned from the data by the decision tree algorithm.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the provided feature encoding (0, 1, 2 for school type, etc.).
* **Depth 2:** The function implements the depth 2 restriction as requested.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list stores the boolean values of the conditions at each inner node, as required.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure is now more aligned with the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.


This improved function provides a more practical implementation of the decision tree while adhering to the specified depth, feature encoding, and output format.  Remember, you would need a real dataset and a decision tree training algorithm to get accurate and meaningful results in practice.
