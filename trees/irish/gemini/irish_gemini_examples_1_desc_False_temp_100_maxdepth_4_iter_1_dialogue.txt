**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** The thresholds are now more specific and tied to the feature encodings.  For example, `X["Educational_level"] <= 5` captures all levels from primary school up to incomplete junior cycle.
* **Simplified Branching:**  The logic is streamlined. We don't need as many nested `if` statements by using the `else` clauses more effectively.
* **Direct Feature Encoding Usage:** The code uses the provided feature encodings directly (e.g., `X["Type_school"] == 0` for primary terminal leaver).
* **Reduced Depth in Some Branches:**  Some paths to a prediction are shorter because the provided logic didn't require the full depth of 4 in all cases.  This improves efficiency.
* **More Interpretable Conditions:** The conditions now reflect the logic described in the previous responses, making the decision tree easier to understand.




**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 35,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Primary terminal leaver
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected Output:
# Prediction: 0
# Nodes: [True, True, True, False]


X = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 80,
    'Educational_level': 10,  # Senior cycle complete
    'Prestige_score': 22,
    'Type_school': 1  # Secondary
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

# Expected Output:
# Prediction: 1
# Nodes: [False, False, False, True]


```


This improved function provides a clearer and more efficient implementation of the hypothetical decision tree, correctly using the given feature encodings and making the decision process more transparent.  Remember that this is still a *hypothetical* example, and a model trained on real data would be much more reliable.
