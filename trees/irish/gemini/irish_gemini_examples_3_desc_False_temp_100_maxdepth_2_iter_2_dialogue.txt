def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Educational_level'] <= 5.5  # Threshold based on Junior/Senior cycle split
    nodes[1] = X['DVRT'] <= 100  # Threshold set at the average DVRT score 

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely to not have a certificate if education level and DVRT are low
        else:
            prediction = 1  # May still obtain a certificate if DVRT is high despite lower education
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Higher education level generally suggests a higher chance of obtaining a certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:**  For a depth-2 tree, we pick two important features. I've chosen:
    - **Educational_level:**  A strong indicator of completing school and obtaining a certificate.
    - **DVRT:** Cognitive ability likely correlates with academic success and certificate attainment.

2. **Thresholds:**
    - **Educational_level (5.5):** Splits between Junior cycle (incomplete/terminal) and Senior cycle levels.
    - **DVRT (100):**  A reasonable placeholder; ideally, this is based on data analysis (e.g., average DVRT for those with/without certificates).

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - The tree prioritizes 'Educational_level'. Those with levels above 5.5 are more likely to have the certificate.
   - For lower education levels, a higher DVRT score might indicate a higher chance of obtaining a certificate.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data-Driven Thresholds:**  The DVRT threshold (100) is a placeholder. Analyzing your data to find optimal splits will improve the tree's accuracy. 
* **Feature Importance:** Without data, it's hard to be certain these are the MOST important features. You might use feature importance from a trained decision tree model on your data to guide this selection. 
* **Tree Depth:**  A depth of 2 might be too limited. Experiment with deeper trees to potentially capture more complex relationships in your data.
