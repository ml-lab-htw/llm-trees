**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with reasonable values based on the feature descriptions and the logic outlined in the previous response. For example, an `Educational_level` of 4 or less represents incomplete Junior cycle or lower, making a certificate less likely.  A `DVRT` score of 50 is used as a hypothetical threshold, assuming it's a standardized score where lower values indicate weaker performance. Similarly, a `Prestige_score` of 10 acts as a dividing line. These values would need adjustment based on real data analysis.
* **Type_school encoding:** The provided encoding is used directly in the conditional.
* **Boolean to Integer Conversion:** The `nodes` list is explicitly converted to integers (0 or 1) before returning, matching the requested format.
* **Clearer Structure:** The code is formatted for readability, with comments explaining the logic at each branch.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 65,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

#Example output (will vary based on input X)
#Prediction: 1
#Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 0]

X = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 40,
    'Educational_level': 3,
    'Prestige_score': 8,
    'Type_school': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

#Example Output
#Prediction: 0
#Nodes: [1, 1, 1, 1]

```


This function provides a working example based on the given information.  Remember, the accuracy and effectiveness of this decision tree depend entirely on the quality and representativeness of the data used to determine the appropriate thresholds and branching logic in a real-world application.  You would need to train a model on a real dataset to get a reliable predictor.
