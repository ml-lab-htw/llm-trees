**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  Realistic threshold values are added for `DVRT` (60) and `Prestige_score` (15).  These are still estimates and should be determined through data analysis.
* **Node Count:** The number of `nodes` in the list is adjusted to match the actual number of decision nodes in the tree.
* **Encoding Alignment:** The code now uses the specified feature encodings (e.g., 0 for primary_terminal_leaver in `Type_school`).
* **Simplified Structure:** The code reflects the decision tree logic more directly, improving readability and efficiency.  Nested `if` statements handle the branching logic.
* **Target Encoding:** The prediction uses the correct target encoding (0 for no certificate, 1 for certificate).



**Example Usage:**

```python
student_data = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 75,
    'Educational_level': 10,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student_data)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Certificate)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False, False, False] (showing which branches were taken)


student_data2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 50,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Primary terminal leaver
    'Prestige_score': 10,
    'Type_school': 0
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(student_data2)
print("Prediction:", prediction2)  # Output: 0 (No Certificate)
print("Nodes:", nodes2) # Output: [True, True, True, True]

```


This refined function provides a clearer implementation of the decision tree logic and aligns with the provided feature encodings and target variable mapping.  Remember to train a real decision tree on your data for accurate predictions.
