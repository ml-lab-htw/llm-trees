```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Assuming completion of Senior Cycle (levels 8-10) is required for the certificate

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Certificate
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification of Threshold:**

* **Educational Levels and Certificate Attainment:**  The provided feature encoding for `Educational_level` suggests a progression of educational attainment.  It's reasonable to assume that a school leaving certificate is generally granted upon completing a certain level of education, likely the Senior Cycle (levels 8-10 in the encoding).
* **Threshold Value (7):**  Therefore, a threshold of 7 (less than or equal to 7) captures those who haven't completed the Senior Cycle and are thus less likely to have the certificate. Those above 7 (8, 9, or 10) are assumed to have completed the Senior Cycle and therefore likely have the certificate.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_student1 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 85,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Junior Cycle Terminal Leaver
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(example_student1)
print(f"Prediction for student 1: {prediction1}")  # Output: 0 (No Certificate)
print(f"Nodes for student 1: {nodes1}") # Output: [True]

example_student2 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 92,
    'Educational_level': 10, # Senior Cycle Terminal Leaver
    'Prestige_score': 22,
    'Type_school': 1
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_student2)
print(f"Prediction for student 2: {prediction2}") # Output: 1 (Certificate)
print(f"Nodes for student 2: {nodes2}")  # Output: [False]
```

**Important Note:**  This function and the threshold are based on assumptions about the relationship between educational level and certificate attainment.  The optimal threshold would be determined by training a decision tree model on a real dataset, which would also allow for assessing the true importance of each feature and potentially building a more complex and accurate model.
