**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Number of Nodes:** The number of `nodes` in the list is adjusted to match the actual number of decision nodes in the tree.
* **Threshold Values:**  Meaningful threshold values are used based on the feature descriptions. For example, `Educational_level <= 8` represents not completing senior cycle, `DVRT <= 50` represents a below-average score, and `Prestige_score <= 10` represents lower socioeconomic status. These are just examples; you can adjust them based on domain knowledge or data analysis.
* **Boolean to Integer Conversion:** The `nodes` list now contains integer values (0 or 1) representing the truth values of the conditions, as requested.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The code is simplified to reflect the decision tree structure more directly, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Clearer Comments:**  Comments are added to explain the logic behind the thresholds and decision branches.



This improved function provides a more accurate representation of the hypothetical decision tree and adheres to the specified requirements. Remember that this is still a hypothetical example, and the optimal tree structure and thresholds would need to be determined using real data and a machine learning algorithm.
