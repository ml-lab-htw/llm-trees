    # a real model would learn this threshold from data)
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 90

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clear Feature Encoding:** Uses the provided encoding for `Type_school` (0, 1, 2).
* **Realistic Threshold:**  Uses a placeholder threshold of 90 for the DVRT score. This would need to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis. A lower threshold would predict certificate attainment more easily. A higher threshold would make it harder.
* **Clear Comments:**  Explains the logic at each node.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to call the function and interpret the output.
* **Correct `nodes` list:** Returns a list of booleans corresponding to the conditions at each node.



This improved function is now much closer to a practical implementation of a decision tree classifier, while still respecting the depth-2 constraint and providing insights into the decision-making process through the `nodes` list. Remember to replace the placeholder DVRT threshold with a value derived from data analysis when working with a real dataset.
