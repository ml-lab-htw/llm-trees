Key improvements:

* **Clearer Structure:**  The `if/elif/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it much easier to follow.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  Reasonable thresholds are included based on the feature descriptions and the hypothetical tree structure from before.
* **Feature Encoding Handling:**  The code correctly uses the provided feature encoding (e.g., 0 for female, 1 for male; numerical values for `Educational_level`, etc.).
* **Example Usage:**  Demonstrates how to use the function and interpret the output.
* **Node Values List:** The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values at each decision point within the tree, as requested.


This revised version is a functional Python representation of the hypothetical decision tree and provides a much better foundation for actual implementation with a real dataset. Remember to replace the hypothetical thresholds with those learned from training a real model.
