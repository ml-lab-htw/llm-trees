```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Using 7 as the threshold for Educational_level
    nodes[1] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # Check if Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver (0)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate (primary terminal leaver)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate

    return prediction, nodes

```


This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree described earlier. It uses the provided feature names and encoding, setting a threshold of 7 for "Educational_level" and checking for "primary_terminal_leaver" (encoded as 0) for "Type_school." Remember, this threshold is a placeholder and would be determined through training on real data in a true machine-learning scenario.  The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` indicating which branches of the tree were taken.
