**Explanation of Thresholds and Logic:**

* **`Educational_level <= 7`:** This checks if the student's educational attainment is at or below primary school completion or early secondary school dropout levels. This is a crucial initial split, as completing a significant portion of secondary education is a prerequisite for most school leaving certificates.
* **`DVRT <= 60`:**  For those with lower educational attainment, the DVRT score acts as a secondary filter. A score below 60 (an arbitrary but plausible threshold) suggests lower academic aptitude, potentially correlating with a lower chance of obtaining a certificate.
* **`Type_school == 2`:** For students who have progressed beyond primary education (Educational_level > 7), the type of school becomes relevant. Attending a vocational school (encoded as 2) *might* be associated with a lower likelihood of a traditional school leaving certificate, although this depends on the specific vocational program.

**Example Usage:**

```python
student_features = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Primary Terminal Leaver
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0  # Doesn't matter for this example, student likely hasn't made it this far in the school system
}

prediction, node_values = predict(student_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Didn't get certificate)
print(f"Node Values: {node_values}")  # Output: Node Values: [True, True, False]


student_features2 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 75,
    'Educational_level': 10,  # Senior Cycle Terminal Leaver
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 1  # Secondary School
}

prediction, node_values = predict(student_features2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (Got certificate)
print(f"Node Values: {node_values}") # Output: Node Values: [False, False, False]

```


It's crucial to remember that this decision tree is a simplified model based on assumptions. Real-world data and machine learning training would be necessary to build a more accurate and robust predictor.  The chosen thresholds are also examples and should be tuned based on data analysis.
