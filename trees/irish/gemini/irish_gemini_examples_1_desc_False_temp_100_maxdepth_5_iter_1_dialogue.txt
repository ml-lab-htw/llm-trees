    # Create a cleaned nodes list without the placeholder, only including decision nodes
    cleaned_nodes = [nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2], nodes[3], nodes[4]] 
    if nodes[3] and nodes[4]: # Only include prestige if relevant branch was taken
      cleaned_nodes.append(prestige_condition)

    return prediction, cleaned_nodes[:5] # Return list of length 5

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with more concrete values based on reasonable assumptions.  For example, a DVRT score of 70 is used as a dividing line, assuming lower scores correlate with lower chances of a certificate.  A prestige score of 15 is used similarly.  These values would ideally be learned from data.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree structure has been simplified slightly to make the code cleaner and more readable while maintaining the core logic. The prestige score is only considered within the vocational track of mid-level education, reflecting a more nuanced assumption.
* **Handling Missing Values:** In a real-world scenario, you would need to add handling for missing values in the input `X`.  This could involve imputation or creating separate branches in the tree for missing values.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list is now populated with the boolean results of each decision node, and the placeholder for prestige score is only appended if the relevant branch is taken.  Then it gets trimmed to size 5 for consistency. This makes it easier to track the path taken through the tree.


This revised function provides a more practical and interpretable implementation of the decision tree, although it still relies on hypothetical thresholds in the absence of real data.  With a real dataset, you could use scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` to learn optimal thresholds and tree structure.  Remember to evaluate the performance of your tree using appropriate metrics and consider techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
