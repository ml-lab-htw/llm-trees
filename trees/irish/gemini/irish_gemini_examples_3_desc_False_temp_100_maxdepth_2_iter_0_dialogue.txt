**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** 
   - Takes a dictionary `X` representing the features of a single student.
   - Returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list.

2. **Nodes List:** 
   - Initialized with `2 * [None]` for the two inner nodes (maximum depth of 2).
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the root node.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to a child node branching from the root.

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - **Node 1 (Root):** Checks if 'DVRT' is less than or equal to 85. This threshold is a plausible assumption based on the idea that higher test scores might correlate with a higher likelihood of obtaining the certificate. 
   - **Node 2:**  The second condition checks different features depending on the outcome of the first condition:
      - If `DVRT` is low, it checks if the `Type_school` is "primary_terminal_leaver" (code 0), which is a strong indicator of not obtaining the certificate. 
      - If `DVRT` is high, it checks the `Educational_level`. Here, a threshold of 6 is used to combine several educational levels  that likely lead to obtaining the certificate (e.g., "Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school").
   - **Predictions:** The `if/elif/else` block at the end assigns the final prediction (0 or 1) based on which leaf node the example falls into.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds (85 for 'DVRT' and 6 for 'Educational_level') are chosen based on logical reasoning and the data encoding provided. However, the optimal thresholds would be determined during the decision tree learning process using a real dataset.
- **Feature Importance:** This decision tree prioritizes 'DVRT' and 'Type_school'/'Educational_level'. In a real-world scenario, the actual feature importance might differ based on the data.
- **Overfitting:** With a maximum depth of 2, this decision tree is very simple and might not capture complex relationships in a dataset. There's a trade-off between model complexity and the risk of overfitting.
