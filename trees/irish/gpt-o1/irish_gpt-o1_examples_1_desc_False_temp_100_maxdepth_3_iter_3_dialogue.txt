```python

                # Type_school is secondary
                nodes[2] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 60)
                if nodes[2] == 1:

            elif X["Type_school"] == 2:
                # Type_school is vocational, predict 1
                prediction = 1
                nodes[2] = 0  # Node 2 is not evaluated, set to 0

**Explanation:**

This function predicts whether a student took the school leaving certificate based on the given features. It also returns a list of truth values (`nodes`) indicating which conditions were met during the decision process.

- **Features:**
  - `Sex`: Sex of the child (0 = female, 1 = male)
  - `DVRT`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
  - `Educational_level`: Educational level attained (encoded from 0 to 10)
  - `Prestige_score`: Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
  - `Type_school`: Type of school (0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational)

- **Target Variable:**
  - `school leaving certificate is taken or not` (0 = not taken, 1 = taken)

**Decision Logic:**

1. **Node 0:** Check if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 4.
   - `nodes[0] = 1` if `Educational_level <= 4`
   - If **yes** (`nodes[0] == 1`), predict **0** (Did not take the school leaving certificate).
   - **Explanation:** Lower educational levels (<=4) are associated with not taking the certificate.

2. If `Educational_level > 4` (`nodes[0] == 0`), proceed to **Node 1**.

3. **Node 1:** Check if `Type_school` is `0` (primary_terminal_leaver).
   - `nodes[1] = 1` if `Type_school == 0`
   - If **yes** (`nodes[1] == 1`), predict **0**.
   - **Explanation:** Students from primary terminal leaver schools are less likely to take the certificate.

4. If `Type_school` is not `0` (`nodes[1] == 0`), proceed based on `Type_school`.

   - **If** `Type_school == 1` (secondary):
     - **Node 2:** Check if `DVRT` is less than or equal to 60.
       - `nodes[2] = 1` if `DVRT <= 60`
       - If **yes** (`nodes[2] == 1`), predict **0**.
       - If **no** (`nodes[2] == 0`), predict **1** (Took the school leaving certificate).
       - **Explanation:** Higher DVRT scores are associated with taking the certificate.

   - **If** `Type_school == 2` (vocational):
     - Predict **1** (Took the school leaving certificate).
     - `nodes[2]` is set to `0` as it's not evaluated.
     - **Explanation:** Students in vocational schools are more likely to take the certificate.

   - **If** `Type_school` is unrecognized:
     - Predict **None** (Cannot make a prediction).
     - `nodes[2]` is set to `0`.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input
sample_input = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 65,
    "Educational_level": 5,
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:** The student **took** the school leaving certificate.
- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0] == 0`: `Educational_level` is greater than 4.
  - `nodes[1] == 0`: `Type_school` is not `primary_terminal_leaver`.
  - `nodes[2] == 0`: `DVRT` score is greater than 60.
