Sure! Based on the decision tree we previously constructed, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. The function follows your examples and returns a single prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Type_school"] == 0 else 0
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Educational_level"] <= 6 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver (0)
        prediction = 0  # School Leaving Certificate not taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Educational_level is less than or equal to 6
            prediction = 0  # School Leaving Certificate not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # School Leaving Certificate taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inner Nodes Truth Values (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the **Type of school** is **primary_terminal_leaver** (`Type_school == 0`). It is `1` if true, `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the **Educational level attained** is less than or equal to `6`. It is `1` if true, `0` otherwise.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`):**
     - If the student is a **primary terminal leaver** (`Type_school == 0`), they did not proceed beyond primary education.
       - **Prediction:** `0` (School Leaving Certificate not taken)
  2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):**
     - If the student attended **secondary** or **vocational** school (`Type_school != 0`), we consider their educational level.
     - If the **Educational_level** is less than or equal to `6`, it indicates they did not reach a level typically associated with taking the certificate.
       - **Prediction:** `0` (School Leaving Certificate not taken)
     - Else, they have attained a higher educational level.
       - **Prediction:** `1` (School Leaving Certificate taken)

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- **Sex** (`Sex`): 0 = female, 1 = male
- **DVRT** (`DVRT`): Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
- **Educational Level** (`Educational_level`): Encoded as integers `0` to `10`
  - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
  - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
  - `2`: (unspecified)
  - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
  - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
  - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
- **Prestige Score** (`Prestige_score`): 0 to 28
- **Type of School** (`Type_school`): 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational

**Thresholds Explanation:**

- **`Type_school == 0`** checks whether the student is a primary terminal leaver.
- **`Educational_level <= 6`** includes educational levels from `0` to `6`, which corresponds to students who have not completed senior cycle education.

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **`prediction`**:
  - `0`: School Leaving Certificate **not taken**
  - `1`: School Leaving Certificate **taken**

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input data
X_example = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 50,
    "Educational_level": 5,
    "Prestige_score": 15,
    "Type_school": 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

In this example:

- **`nodes[0] = 0`** because `Type_school` is not `0` (student is not a primary terminal leaver).
- **`nodes[1] = 1`** because `Educational_level` is `5`, which is less than or equal to `6`.
- **Prediction** is `0`, indicating the School Leaving Certificate was not taken.

**Note on Thresholds:**

- The threshold for **Educational_level** is set at `6` to distinguish between students who have not progressed beyond the junior cycle and those who have attained higher levels, which aligns with the likelihood of taking the School Leaving Certificate.

I hope this provides a clear and precise implementation of the decision tree classifier based on your specifications!
