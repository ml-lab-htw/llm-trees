**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:**  The function now uses the correct encoding for the features as provided (0/1 for sex, numerical for DVRT,  categorical encoding for education level and school type).
* **Threshold for DVRT:** I've used 90 as a placeholder threshold for the DVRT.  This needs to be determined through data analysis (e.g., finding a value that optimally separates students with and without certificates in the training data).  A more sophisticated approach might involve z-score normalization of the DVRT.
* **Handling Missing Data:**  The current function doesn't handle potential missing data.  In a real-world scenario, you should include checks for missing values and implement strategies for imputation (filling in missing values) or exclusion.
* **Educational Levels:** The logic for Educational_level is designed to capture the idea that anyone who has completed Senior Cycle (or beyond) is very likely to have a school leaving certificate, regardless of other factors. This decision tree simplifies the true dynamics, but within the depth-2 constraint and with the given feature encodings it is a reasonable approach.



This revised function is a more practical implementation, but remember that the accuracy of the decision tree fundamentally depends on the quality of the data and the chosen threshold values.  Data analysis, model validation, and potentially more complex models are essential for robust predictions.
