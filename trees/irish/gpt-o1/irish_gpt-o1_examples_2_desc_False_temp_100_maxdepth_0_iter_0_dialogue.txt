Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict` that implements the decision tree based on the features you've provided. The function returns a prediction (0 = not taken, 1 = taken) for whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not, as well as a list representing the truth values (1 or 0) of the inner nodes of the decision tree.

Please make sure to use the exact feature keys as specified:
- `'Sex'`
- `'DVRT'`
- `'Educational_level'`
- `'Prestige_score'`
- `'Type_school'`

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [0]

    # Node 0: Is Type_school == 1 (Secondary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 1)

    # Node 1: Is Type_school == 2 (Vocational)
    nodes[1] = int(X["Type_school"] == 2)

    # Node 2: Is Type_school == 0 (Primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)

    # Node 3: For vocational school, is Educational_level >= 5
    if nodes[1]:
        nodes[3] = int(X["Educational_level"] >= 5)
    else:
        nodes[3] = 0  # Not evaluated

    # Node 4: For vocational school and Educational_level >=5, is DVRT >= 50
    if nodes[3]:
        nodes[4] = int(X["DVRT"] >= 50)
    else:
        nodes[4] = 0  # Not evaluated

    # Node 5: For primary terminal leaver, is Prestige_score >= 15
    if nodes[2]:
        nodes[5] = int(X["Prestige_score"] >= 15)
    else:
        nodes[5] = 0  # Not evaluated

    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # Type_school == 1 (Secondary)
        prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
    elif nodes[1]:
        # Type_school == 2 (Vocational)
        if nodes[3]:
            # Educational_level >= 5
            if nodes[4]:
                # DVRT >= 50
                prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Certificate
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    elif nodes[2]:
        # Type_school == 0 (Primary_terminal_leaver)
        if nodes[5]:
            # Prestige_score >= 15
            prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Certificate
    else:
        # Unrecognized Type_school value
        prediction = 0  # Default to No Certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the student is from a **secondary school** (`Type_school == 1`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the student is from a **vocational school** (`Type_school == 2`).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the student is a **primary terminal leaver** (`Type_school == 0`).
  - `nodes[3]`: For vocational students, checks if **Educational_level** is **5 or higher**.
  - `nodes[4]`: For vocational students with sufficient educational level, checks if **DVRT** is **50 or higher**.
  - `nodes[5]`: For primary terminal leavers, checks if the **Prestige_score** is **15 or higher**.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If the student is from a **secondary school**, they are predicted to have taken the certificate.
  - If from a **vocational school**:
    - And they have an **Educational_level** of **5 or higher**:
      - They must also have a **DVRT** score of **50 or higher** to be predicted as having taken the certificate.
      - Otherwise, they are predicted as not having taken it.
    - If their **Educational_level** is below **5**, they are predicted as not having taken it.
  - If the student is a **primary terminal leaver**:
    - A **Prestige_score** of **15 or higher** predicts they have taken the certificate.
    - Otherwise, they are predicted as not having taken it.
  - For any other **Type_school** values, the prediction defaults to not having taken the certificate.

**Feature Encodings and Ranges:**

- **Sex**: `0` = female, `1` = male
- **DVRT**: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (numeric value)
- **Educational_level**:
  - `0` = 3rd level complete
  - `1` = 3rd level incomplete
  - `2` = ?
  - `3` = Junior cycle incomplete - secondary school
  - `4` = Junior cycle incomplete - vocational school
  - `5` = Junior cycle terminal leaver - secondary school
  - `6` = Junior cycle terminal leaver - vocational school
  - `7` = Primary terminal leaver
  - `8` = Senior cycle incomplete - secondary school
  - `9` = Senior cycle incomplete - vocational school
  - `10` = Senior cycle terminal leaver - secondary school
- **Prestige_score**: Ranges from `0` to `28`
- **Type_school**:
  - `0` = primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2` = vocational

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input dictionary
X_sample = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 55,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 12,
    "Type_school": 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
```

In this example:
- The student is male, from a vocational school (`Type_school` = 2).
- Their educational level is 6 (above 5), so `nodes[3]` is `1`.
- Their DVRT score is 55 (above 50), so `nodes[4]` is `1`.
- However, since their Prestige_score is 12 (below 15) and they are not a primary terminal leaver, this doesn't affect the prediction.
- The final prediction is `0` (not taken), based on the logic provided.

**Notes:**

- Ensure all feature values are provided in the correct format and encoding.
- The thresholds (`Educational_level >= 5`, `DVRT >= 50`, and `Prestige_score >= 15`) are chosen based on meaningful distinctions in the educational context.
- The nodes list indicates which conditions were met (`1`) or not met (`0`) for the decision-making process.

Feel free to adjust the feature values in the input dictionary to see how the prediction and nodes change based on different scenarios.
