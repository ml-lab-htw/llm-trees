Sure, here's the Python function that represents the decision tree, formatted as per your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*5  # Initialize list for node truth values
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)  # Node 0: Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Did not take the school leaving certificate
    else:
        nodes[1] = int(X["Type_school"] == 2)  # Node 1: Type_school == vocational

        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = int(X["Educational_level"] <= 5)  # Node 2: Educational_level <= 5

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Did not take the certificate
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Took the certificate
        else:
            nodes[3] = int(X["Type_school"] == 1)  # Node 3: Type_school == secondary_terminal_leaver

            if nodes[3]:
                nodes[4] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 50)  # Node 4: DVRT <= 50

                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Did not take the certificate
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Took the certificate
            else:
                # If Type_school is not 0, 1, or 2, we cannot make a prediction
                prediction = None  # Unknown or unclassified
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** checks if the `Type_school` is **primary_terminal_leaver** (encoded as `0`). If this condition is true (`nodes[0] == 1`), the student did **not** take the school leaving certificate (`prediction = 0`), and the function returns.

- If **Node 0** condition is false (`nodes[0] == 0`), we proceed to **Node 1**, which checks if the `Type_school` is **vocational** (encoded as `2`).

  - If **Node 1** condition is true (`nodes[1] == 1`), we proceed to **Node 2**, which checks if the `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5`.
  
    - If **Node 2** condition is true (`nodes[2] == 1`), the student did **not** take the certificate (`prediction = 0`).
    
    - If **Node 2** condition is false (`nodes[2] == 0`), the student **did** take the certificate (`prediction = 1`).

- If **Node 1** condition is false (`nodes[1] == 0`), we proceed to **Node 3**, which checks if the `Type_school` is **secondary_terminal_leaver** (encoded as `1`).

  - If **Node 3** condition is true (`nodes[3] == 1`), we proceed to **Node 4**, which checks if the `DVRT` score is less than or equal to `50`.
  
    - If **Node 4** condition is true (`nodes[4] == 1`), the student did **not** take the certificate (`prediction = 0`).
    
    - If **Node 4** condition is false (`nodes[4] == 0`), the student **did** take the certificate (`prediction = 1`).

- If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., `Type_school` is not `0`, `1`, or `2`), the `prediction` is set to `None` to indicate that we cannot make a prediction based on the given data.

**Notes on Feature Encoding and Ranges:**

- **Sex**: Not used in this decision tree.
- **DVRT**: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score; used in **Node 4**.
- **Educational_level**: Encoded from `0` to `10`; used in **Node 2**.
- **Prestige_score**: Not used in this decision tree.
- **Type_school**: Encoded as:
  - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2`: vocational

**Example Usage:**

Let's test the function with some example inputs.

```python
# Example where Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver
X1 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 7,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 0
}
prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Example where Type_school is vocational, Educational_level <= 5
X2 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 4,
    'Prestige_score': 20,
    'Type_school': 2
}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}, Nodes: [prediction2, nodes2]")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

# Example where Type_school is vocational, Educational_level > 5
X3 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 65,
    'Educational_level': 6,
    'Prestige_score': 10,
    'Type_school': 2
}
prediction3, nodes3 = predict(X3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction3}, Nodes: {nodes3}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

# Example where Type_school is secondary_terminal_leaver, DVRT <= 50
X4 = {
    'Sex': 0,
    'DVRT': 45,
    'Educational_level': 8,
    'Prestige_score': 18,
    'Type_school': 1
}
prediction4, nodes4 = predict(X4)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction4}, Nodes: {nodes4}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

# Example where Type_school is secondary_terminal_leaver, DVRT > 50
X5 = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 9,
    'Prestige_score': 25,
    'Type_school': 1
}
prediction5, nodes5 = predict(X5)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction5}, Nodes: {nodes5}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```

**Explanation of Nodes List:**

- The `nodes` list contains 1s and 0s corresponding to whether each node's condition is **True** or **False** respectively.
- **Index 0**: Checks if `Type_school` is `0` (primary_terminal_leaver).
- **Index 1**: Checks if `Type_school` is `2` (vocational).
- **Index 2**: Checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5`.
- **Index 3**: Checks if `Type_school` is `1` (secondary_terminal_leaver).
- **Index 4**: Checks if `DVRT` is less than or equal to `50`.

**Important:**

- The function strictly follows the given feature encodings and utilizes the most impactful features as per the decision tree.
- Unused features like `Sex` and `Prestige_score` are present in the input but are not used in this specific decision tree.
