Sure! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 2  # Initialize the nodes list with default values

    # Node 0: Check if the Type of School is 'secondary_terminal_leaver' (Type_school == 1)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Type_school"] == 1 else 0

    # Node 1: Check if the Educational Level Attained is greater than or equal to 5
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Educational_level"] >= 5 else 0

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list holds the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition: `Type_school == 1` (the student attends a secondary school).
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition: `Educational_level >= 5`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If `nodes[0]` is `1`:** The student attends a secondary school, so they are predicted to have taken the school leaving certificate (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Else:**
    - **If `nodes[1]` is `1`:** The student's educational level is high enough (â‰¥5) to have taken the certificate (`prediction = 1`).
    - **Else:** The student is predicted not to have taken the certificate (`prediction = 0`).

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Exact Feature Keys:**
  - `'Sex'`
  - `'DVRT'`
  - `'Educational_level'`
  - `'Prestige_score'`
  - `'Type_school'`

- **Feature Descriptions and Encodings:**
  - **Sex:** Sex of child (`0` = female, `1` = male)
  - **DVRT:** Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
  - **Educational_level:** Educational level attained
    - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
    - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
    - `2`: ?
    - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
    - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - **Prestige_score:** Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
  - **Type_school:** Type of school
    - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
    - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
    - `2`: vocational

- **Target Variable:**
  - `0`: School leaving certificate **not** taken
  - `1`: School leaving certificate taken

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function with an example input:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 50,  # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
    "Educational_level": 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    "Prestige_score": 20,
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**
```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

- **Prediction:** `1` indicates that the school leaving certificate is predicted to be taken.
- **Nodes:** `[1, 1]` shows that both conditions in the decision tree are satisfied.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct spelling and casing as specified.
- The thresholds and conditions are based on meaningful values derived from the feature encodings and the decision tree you're building.
- If the `Educational_level` is unknown (`2`), you'll need to decide how to handle it, possibly by assigning a default value or modifying the function accordingly.

**Full Decision Tree Logic:**

```plaintext
|--- Type_school == 1 (secondary_terminal_leaver)
|    |--- Prediction: 1 (Certificate Taken)
|--- Type_school != 1
|    |--- Educational_level >= 5
|    |    |--- Prediction: 1 (Certificate Taken)
|    |--- Educational_level < 5
|    |    |--- Prediction: 0 (Certificate Not Taken)
```

This function follows your specifications and uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature encodings provided.
