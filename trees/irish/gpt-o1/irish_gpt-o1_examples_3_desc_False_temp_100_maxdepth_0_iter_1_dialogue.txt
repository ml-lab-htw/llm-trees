Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features and encodings you've provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, evaluates the decision tree, and returns the prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X["Educational_level"] <= 5)
    nodes[2] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 50)

    if nodes[0]:  # If Type_school == 0 (Primary Terminal Leaver)
        prediction = 0  # Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If Educational_level <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If DVRT <= 50
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Type_school"`: Type of school attended.
    - Encoded as:
      - `0`: Primary Terminal Leaver
      - `1`: Secondary Terminal Leaver
      - `2`: Vocational
  - `"Educational_level"`: Educational level attained.
    - Encoded values range from `0` to `10` (see your provided encoding).
  - `"DVRT"`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (numerical value).

- **Inner Nodes Conditions:**

  1. `nodes[0]`: Checks if the student attended a **Primary Terminal Leaver** school.
     - `nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)`
     - **True (1)** if `Type_school` is `0`.
  2. `nodes[1]`: Checks if the **Educational Level Attained** is less than or equal to `5`.
     - `nodes[1] = int(X["Educational_level"] <= 5)`
     - **True (1)** if `Educational_level` is `5` or less.
  3. `nodes[2]`: Checks if the **DVRT** score is less than or equal to `50`.
     - `nodes[2] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 50)`
     - **True (1)** if `DVRT` is `50` or less.

- **Decision Flow:**

  - **Node 0**:
    - If `nodes[0]` is **True** (`Type_school` == `0`):
      - **Prediction**: `0` (Not Taken)
  - **Node 1** (evaluated if `nodes[0]` is **False**):
    - If `nodes[1]` is **True** (`Educational_level` ≤ `5`):
      - **Prediction**: `0` (Not Taken)
  - **Node 2** (evaluated if `nodes[1]` is **False**):
    - If `nodes[2]` is **True** (`DVRT` ≤ `50`):
      - **Prediction**: `0` (Not Taken)
    - Else:
      - **Prediction**: `1` (Taken)

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: `0` (Not Taken) or `1` (Taken)
  - `nodes`: List of truth values `[nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2]]`
    - Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 55,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 20,
    "Type_school": 1  # Secondary Terminal Leaver
}

# Making a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]`: `0` because `Type_school` is not `0` (student did not attend a Primary Terminal Leaver school).
- `nodes[1]`: `0` because `Educational_level` is `6`, which is greater than `5`.
- `nodes[2]`: `0` because `DVRT` is `55`, which is greater than `50`.
- Since all conditions for "Not Taken" are not met, the prediction is `1` (Taken).

**Thresholds Explanation:**

- **Educational_Level Threshold (≤ 5):**
  - The threshold of `5` corresponds to students who have not progressed beyond certain educational stages (up to Junior Cycle Terminal Leaver - Secondary School).
  - Students with an educational level greater than `5` have progressed further in their education, indicating a higher likelihood of taking the leaving certificate.

- **DVRT Threshold (≤ 50):**
  - A DVRT score of `50` is chosen as a benchmark to distinguish between lower and higher verbal reasoning abilities.
  - Students scoring above `50` are considered to have higher academic ability, increasing the likelihood of taking the leaving certificate.

**Note on Features Not Used:**

- **Sex** and **Prestige_score** were not included in the decision tree since, based on the constructed model, they did not provide additional decision-making value for this classification. However, they can be considered in further model refinements if necessary.

---

**Consistency with Provided Examples:**

- The function follows the format of your provided examples.
- The **nodes** list accurately represents the truth values of the inner nodes, with `1` indicating the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
- All feature names and encodings are carefully matched to your specifications.

Feel free to test the function with different input values or adjust thresholds if you have specific data insights.
