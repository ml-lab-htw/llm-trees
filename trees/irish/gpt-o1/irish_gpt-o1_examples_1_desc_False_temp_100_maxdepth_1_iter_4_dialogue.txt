Certainly! Based on the decision tree you've provided and the features with their encodings, here is the Python function formatted as per your instructions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Initialize the list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Check the condition at the root node
    nodes[0] = X['Type_school'] == 1  # 1 corresponds to 'secondary_terminal_leaver'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # 'Taken' (school leaving certificate is taken)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # 'Not taken' (school leaving certificate is not taken)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `Type_school`
  - **Encoding:**
    - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
    - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
    - `2`: vocational

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If `Type_school` is equal to `1` (i.e., the student is from a secondary terminal leaver school), then predict that the school leaving certificate **is taken** (`prediction = 1`).
  - Otherwise (i.e., the student is from a vocational school or is a primary terminal leaver), predict that the school leaving certificate **is not taken** (`prediction = 0`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` stores the truth value of the condition `X['Type_school'] == 1`.
    - It will be `True` (or `1`) if the condition is satisfied.
    - It will be `False` (or `0`) if the condition is not satisfied.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Sample input where the student is from a secondary_terminal_leaver school
X_example_1 = {
    'Sex': 0,  # Female
    'DVRT': 50,
    'Educational_level': 5,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example_1)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [True]

# Sample input where the student is from a vocational school
X_example_2 = {
    'Sex': 1,  # Male
    'DVRT': 60,
    'Educational_level': 6,
    'Prestige_score': 10,
    'Type_school': 2  # vocational
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example_2)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [False]
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values as per the encodings provided.
- The function strictly uses the `Type_school` feature for prediction, adhering to the maximum depth of 1 in the decision tree.
