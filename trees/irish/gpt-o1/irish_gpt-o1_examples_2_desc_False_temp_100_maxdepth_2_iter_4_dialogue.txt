The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` of features and returns a single prediction (`0` for "SLC not taken", `1` for "SLC taken") and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in `nodes` is `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # First condition: Check if Type_school is 'primary_terminal_leaver' (0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Type_school'] == 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # SLC not taken
        nodes[1] = 0    # Second node is not evaluated in this path
    else:
        # Second condition: Check if Educational_level is less than or equal to 7
        nodes[1] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 7)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # SLC not taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # SLC taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize the `nodes` List:**

   - We create a list `nodes` with two `None` values to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. **First Condition (Node 0):**

   - We check if `Type_school` is `0`, which corresponds to `'primary_terminal_leaver'`.
   - `nodes[0] = int(X['Type_school'] == 0)` stores `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.
   - If the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), the student has not taken the SLC (`prediction = 0`), and we proceed no further.
   - We set `nodes[1] = 0` to indicate that the second condition was not evaluated in this path.

3. **Second Condition (Node 1):**

   - If the first condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] == 0`), we proceed to the second condition.
   - We check if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `7`.
   - This threshold is meaningful because levels greater than `7` correspond to higher education levels where students are more likely to have taken the SLC.
   - `nodes[1] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 7)` stores `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.
   - Based on the result:
     - If `nodes[1] == 1`, the student has not taken the SLC (`prediction = 0`).
     - If `nodes[1] == 0`, the student has taken the SLC (`prediction = 1`).

4. **Return Statement:**

   - The function returns the `prediction` and the list `nodes`, which contains the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the function with an example input:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'Sex': 1,                  # Male
    'DVRT': 50,                # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 8,    # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,      # Prestige score for father's occupation
    'Type_school': 1           # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (SLC taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `0` because `Type_school` is `1` (not `primary_terminal_leaver`).
- `nodes[1]` is `0` because `Educational_level` (`8`) is greater than `7`.
- The prediction is `1`, indicating that the student has taken the SLC.

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- **Sex:**
  - `0` = female
  - `1` = male

- **Type_school:**
  - `0` = primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2` = vocational

- **Educational_level** (Key Levels):
  - Levels `0` to `7` represent lower educational attainment.
  - Levels greater than `7` represent higher educational attainment where students are more likely to have taken the SLC.

**Note:** This function uses the most important features (`Type_school` and `Educational_level`) identified in the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify whether the school leaving certificate has been taken.
