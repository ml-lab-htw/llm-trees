Certainly! Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Educational_level <= 6
    nodes[0] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 6)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        # Node 1: Type_school == 1 (secondary_terminal_leaver)
        nodes[1] = int(X['Type_school'] == 1)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - We are using the exact keys provided:
    - `'Sex'`
    - `'DVRT'`
    - `'Educational_level'`
    - `'Prestige_score'`
    - `'Type_school'`

- **Node Conditions:**
  1. **Node 0:** Checks if the **Educational_level** is less than or equal to 6.
     - `nodes[0] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 6)`
     - **Interpretation:** Students with an educational level attained of 6 or below are predicted **not to have taken** the school leaving certificate.
     - **Encoding Reference:** Educational levels 0 to 6 correspond to lower educational attainment levels.
  2. **Node 1:** (Only evaluated if Node 0 condition is not satisfied) Checks if the **Type_school** is equal to 1 (which corresponds to `secondary_terminal_leaver`).
     - `nodes[1] = int(X['Type_school'] == 1)`
     - **Interpretation:** Among students with an educational level above 6, those attending a secondary terminal leaver school are predicted **to have taken** the school leaving certificate.
     - **Encoding Reference:** In the feature description, `Type_school` encoding is:
       - `0 = primary_terminal_leaver`
       - `1 = secondary_terminal_leaver`
       - `2 = vocational`

- **Prediction:**
  - If **Node 0** condition is satisfied (`Educational_level` â‰¤ 6), the prediction is `0` (Certificate not taken).
  - Else, if **Node 1** condition is satisfied (`Type_school` == 1), the prediction is `1` (Certificate taken).
  - Else, the prediction is `0` (Certificate not taken).

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (`0` or `1`).
  - `nodes`: A list `[nodes[0], nodes[1]]` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    'Sex': 0,                # 0 = female
    'DVRT': 50,              # Example score
    'Educational_level': 7,  # Above 6
    'Prestige_score': 20,    # Example score
    'Type_school': 1         # 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values as specified.
- The function strictly follows the feature encodings and uses meaningful threshold values based on the provided data descriptions.
- The nodes list helps trace the path taken in the decision tree for the given input.
