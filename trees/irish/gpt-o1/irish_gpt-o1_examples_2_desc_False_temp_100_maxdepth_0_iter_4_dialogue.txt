Sure! Based on the decision tree provided and following your instructions, here is the formatted Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize the list of node conditions
    
    # Node 0: Check if Type_school == 0 (primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Type_school'] == 0)
    
    # Node 1: Check if Educational_level >= 5
    # Educational_level encoding:
    # 0 = 3rd_level_complete
    # 1 = 3rd_level_incomplete
    # ...
    # 5 = Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    nodes[1] = int(X['Educational_level'] >= 5)
    
    # Node 2: Check if DVRT (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) >= 50
    nodes[2] = int(X['DVRT'] >= 50)
    
    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Type_school == primary_terminal_leaver
        prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Educational_level >= 5
            prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # DVRT >= 50
                prediction = 1  # Certificate taken
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Certificate not taken
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Key Spellings:**
  - We have used the exact feature keys as provided:
    - `'Sex'`
    - `'DVRT'`
    - `'Educational_level'`
    - `'Prestige_score'`
    - `'Type_school'`

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision node: `Type_school == 0` (primary terminal leaver).
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision node: `Educational_level >= 5`.
  - `nodes[2]` corresponds to the third decision node: `DVRT >= 50`.

- **Condition Encoding:**
  - The entries in the `nodes` list are `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `Type_school` is `0` (primary terminal leaver):
    - **Then** predict `0` (Certificate not taken).
  - **Else,** check `Educational_level`:
    - **If** `Educational_level >= 5`:
      - **Then** predict `1` (Certificate taken).
    - **Else,** check `DVRT` score:
      - **If** `DVRT >= 50`:
        - **Then** predict `1` (Certificate taken).
      - **Else**
        - Predict `0` (Certificate not taken).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a student's data as follows:

```python
student_data = {
    'Sex': 1,                   # Male
    'DVRT': 55,                 # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 4,     # Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,       # Prestige score for father's occupation
    'Type_school': 1            # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}
```

We can predict whether the student has taken the school leaving certificate:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(student_data)
print("Prediction:", "Taken" if prediction == 1 else "Not Taken")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Taken
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 0`: The student did not attend a primary terminal leaver school.
- `nodes[1] = 0`: The student's educational level is less than 5.
- `nodes[2] = 1`: The student's DVRT score is greater than or equal to 50.
- Since `nodes[2] = 1`, the model predicts that the student **has taken** the school leaving certificate.

**Notes:**

- **Threshold Values:**
  - The threshold of `DVRT >= 50` was chosen as a meaningful cutoff based on typical scoring scales, where a higher score indicates better reasoning ability.

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - **Type_school Encoding:**
    - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
    - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
    - `2`: vocational
  - **Educational_level Encoding:**
    - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
    - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
    - `2`: Unknown (`?`)
    - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
    - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: School leaving certificate **not taken**.
  - `1`: School leaving certificate **taken**.

**Ensure Input Accuracy:**

- When using the `predict` function, make sure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values as specified.
