def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7  # Primary terminal leaver or below
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85  # Hypothetical threshold for DVRT

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Didn't finish sufficient schooling
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Lower DVRT score, less likely to get certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Higher DVRT score, more likely to get certificate

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Rationale:**

1. **`nodes[0] = X["Educational_level"] <= 7`:** This corresponds to the first split in the decision tree.  We check if the educational level is at or below "Primary_terminal_leaver" (encoded as 7).  If it is, we predict that the student did not receive the certificate. This aligns with the logic that completing primary school is not sufficient for the certificate.

2. **`nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 85`:** This is the second split, applied only if the student's education level is *above* primary school.  We've chosen a hypothetical DVRT threshold of 85. This threshold would need to be determined from actual data analysis and might represent a score around the 50th percentile or a score associated with passing relevant exams.

3. **Predictions:**
   - If `nodes[0]` is true (educational level <= 7), we predict `0` (no certificate), regardless of the DVRT score.
   - If `nodes[0]` is false (educational level > 7), we check `nodes[1]` (DVRT score):
     - If `nodes[1]` is true (DVRT <= 85), we predict `0` (no certificate).
     - If `nodes[1]` is false (DVRT > 85), we predict `1` (certificate).

4. **Return Values:** The function returns both the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, which contains the truth values (True/False, or 1/0 when converted to integers) for the conditions at each inner node. This allows us to trace the path taken through the decision tree for a given input.


**Key Improvements:**

* **Concrete Threshold:**  We've replaced the placeholder "threshold" for DVRT with a concrete value (85) for demonstration purposes. In a real application, this threshold would be learned from the data during training.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The code directly reflects the decision tree structure, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Adherence to Specifications:** The function uses the specified feature names, target encoding, and the requested format for output.



This refined function is now fully functional and provides a clear, reproducible implementation of the decision tree, although the DVRT threshold is hypothetical and should be determined with proper data analysis.
