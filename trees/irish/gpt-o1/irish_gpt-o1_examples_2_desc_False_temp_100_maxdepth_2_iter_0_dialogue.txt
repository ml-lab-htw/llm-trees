```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0  # 0 corresponds to 'primary_terminal_leaver'
    nodes[1] = X["DVRT"] <= 50        # Threshold of 50 for the DVRT score

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Does not take the school leaving certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Does not take the school leaving certificate
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Takes the school leaving certificate

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the `Type_school` is `0`, which corresponds to `'primary_terminal_leaver'`. If this condition is `True`, it means the student is from a primary terminal leaver school.
- **nodes[1]:** Evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `False`. It checks if the `DVRT` score is less than or equal to `50`.

**Feature Encodings Used:**

- **Type_school:**
  - `0` = `'primary_terminal_leaver'`
  - `1` = `'secondary_terminal_leaver'`
  - `2` = `'vocational'`

- **DVRT:** Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (numeric value).

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0` = Does **not** take the school leaving certificate.
- `1` = **Takes** the school leaving certificate.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a student with the following features:

```python
student = {
    "Sex": 1,                   # 1 = male
    "DVRT": 55,                 # DVRT score of 55
    "Educational_level": 4,     # Encoded educational level
    "Prestige_score": 15,       # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 1            # 1 = 'secondary_terminal_leaver'
}
```

We can predict whether they take the school leaving certificate:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(student)
print("Prediction:", "Takes the certificate" if prediction == 1 else "Does not take the certificate")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Takes the certificate
Nodes truth values: [False, False]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0]` is `False` because `Type_school` is not `0`.
  - `nodes[1]` is `False` because `DVRT` score (`55`) is greater than `50`.
  - The final prediction is `1`, meaning the student takes the school leaving certificate.

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct encodings as specified.
