The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, and returns a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner node(s).

**Decision Tree Explanation:**

We're using the feature **`Type_school`** as it directly impacts whether the school leaving certificate is taken. According to the encoding:

- `Type_school`:
  - `0` = primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2` = vocational

Students attending **secondary terminal schools** (`Type_school == 1`) are more likely to take the school leaving certificate. Therefore, our decision tree checks if `Type_school` is equal to `1`.

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # There is only one node in this depth-1 tree
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a student's data:

```python
student_data = {
    'Sex': 0,  # Female
    'DVRT': 50,
    'Educational_level': 5,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: [1]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node Evaluation:**

  - `nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 1)`
    - If `X["Type_school"]` equals `1` (secondary_terminal_leaver), `nodes[0]` is `1`.
    - Otherwise, `nodes[0]` is `0`.

- **Prediction:**

  - If `nodes[0]` is `1`:
    - `prediction = 1` (School leaving certificate is taken)
  - Else:
    - `prediction = 0` (School leaving certificate is not taken)

**Important Notes:**

- The function strictly uses the provided feature keys and encodings.
- The `nodes` list contains `1` if the node's condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise, as per the requirement.
- The decision tree has a maximum depth of 1, using the most significant feature (`Type_school`).
