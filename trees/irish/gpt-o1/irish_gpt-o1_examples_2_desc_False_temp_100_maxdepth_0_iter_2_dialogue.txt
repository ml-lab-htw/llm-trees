Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)

    # Node 1: Check if Educational_level is greater than or equal to 5
    nodes[1] = int(X["Educational_level"] >= 5)

    # Node 2: Check if Prestige_score is greater than or equal to 15
    nodes[2] = int(X["Prestige_score"] >= 15)

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver, predict 'not taken' (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Educational_level >= 5, predict 'taken' (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Prestige_score >= 15, predict 'taken' (1)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Otherwise, predict 'not taken' (0)
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the student attended a **primary_terminal_leaver** school (`Type_school == 0`).
    - **1** if true, **0** if false.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the **Educational_level** attained is **greater than or equal to 5**.
    - **1** if true, **0** if false.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the **Prestige_score** for the father's occupation is **greater than or equal to 15**.
    - **1** if true, **0** if false.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is **1**:
    - The student is classified as **not taken** (0), since they attended a primary_terminal_leaver school.
  - **Else**:
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is **1**:
      - The student is classified as **taken** (1), due to sufficient educational attainment.
    - **Else**:
      - **If** `nodes[2]` is **1**:
        - The student is classified as **taken** (1), possibly due to socioeconomic advantages.
      - **Else**:
        - The student is classified as **not taken** (0).

**Feature Keys and Encoding:**

- **Sex**: Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **DVRT**: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
- **Educational_level**: Educational level attained
  - Values range from **0 to 10**:
    - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
    - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
    - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
    - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
- **Prestige_score**: Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
- **Type_school**: Type of school
  - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2`: vocational

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **School leaving certificate is taken or not**:
  - `0`: Not taken
  - `1`: Taken

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example feature input
X = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 85,
    "Educational_level": 4,
    "Prestige_score": 18,
    "Type_school": 1  # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The student did not attend a primary_terminal_leaver school.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: Educational_level is less than 5.
  - `nodes[2] = 1`: Prestige_score is greater than or equal to 15.
  - **Prediction**: `1` (School Leaving Certificate Taken)

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys as specified.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The classification result (0 = not taken, 1 = taken).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values corresponding to each condition in the decision tree.
