Sure, I'd be happy to format the decision tree as a Python function according to your specifications.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X['Type_school'] == 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 5)
    nodes[2] = int(X['DVRT'] <= 50)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - `'Sex'`: Sex of the child (0 = female, 1 = male)
  - `'DVRT'`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
  - `'Educational_level'`: Educational level attained
  - `'Prestige_score'`: Prestige score for father's occupation
  - `'Type_school'`: Type of school attended

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the student is a primary terminal leaver (`Type_school == 0`)
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the educational level attained is less than or equal to 5 (`Educational_level <= 5`)
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the DVRT score is less than or equal to 50 (`DVRT <= 50`)

**Decision Logic:**

1. **Node 0**: If the student is from a Primary Terminal Leaver school (`Type_school == 0`), then they are classified as **Certificate Not Taken**.
2. **Node 1**: If the student is **not** from a Primary Terminal Leaver school and their **Educational Level** is **5 or below**, they are classified as **Certificate Not Taken**.
3. **Node 2**: If the student is **not** from a Primary Terminal Leaver school, has an **Educational Level** above **5**, but has a **DVRT** score of **50 or below**, they are classified as **Certificate Not Taken**.
4. **Else**: The student is classified as **Certificate Taken**.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    'Sex': 1,                   # Male
    'DVRT': 55,                 # DVRT score of 55
    'Educational_level': 6,     # Educational level 6
    'Prestige_score': 20,       # Prestige score of 20
    'Type_school': 2            # Vocational school
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The student is **not** from a Primary Terminal Leaver school.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: The student's educational level is **above** 5.
  - `nodes[2] = 0`: The student's DVRT score is **above** 50.
  - Since none of the conditions for **Certificate Not Taken** are met, the student is predicted to have **Taken** the certificate (`prediction = 1`).

**Threshold Values:**

- The threshold for `Educational_level` is set at **5**. This is based on the levels where students typically decide to leave school.
- The threshold for `DVRT` is set at **50**. This represents an average score; students scoring above this are more likely to take the certificate.

**Feature Encoding Reference:**

- **Sex:**
  - `0`: Female
  - `1`: Male
- **Educational_level:**
  - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
  - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
  - `2`: Not specified
  - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
  - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
  - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
- **Type_school:**
  - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2`: vocational

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature keys: `'Sex'`, `'DVRT'`, `'Educational_level'`, `'Prestige_score'`, `'Type_school'`.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (`0` for Certificate Not Taken, `1` for Certificate Taken).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes.

**Testing the Function:**

You can test the function with different input values to see how the predictions change:

```python
# Test case: Student from a Primary Terminal Leaver school
X_test1 = {
    'Sex': 0,                   # Female
    'DVRT': 60,                 # DVRT score of 60
    'Educational_level': 8,     # Educational level 8
    'Prestige_score': 15,       # Prestige score of 15
    'Type_school': 0            # Primary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X_test1)
print("Prediction:", prediction1)  # Expected: 0 (Certificate Not Taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes1)            # Expected Nodes: [1, 0, 0]

# Test case: Student with low educational level and DVRT score
X_test2 = {
    'Sex': 1,                   # Male
    'DVRT': 45,                 # DVRT score of 45
    'Educational_level': 4,     # Educational level 4
    'Prestige_score': 10,       # Prestige score of 10
    'Type_school': 2            # Vocational school
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X_test2)
print("Prediction:", prediction2)  # Expected: 0 (Certificate Not Taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes2)            # Expected Nodes: [0, 1, 1]

# Test case: Student likely to take the certificate
X_test3 = {
    'Sex': 0,                   # Female
    'DVRT': 70,                 # DVRT score of 70
    'Educational_level': 8,     # Educational level 8
    'Prestige_score': 25,       # Prestige score of 25
    'Type_school': 1            # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction3, nodes3 = predict(X_test3)
print("Prediction:", prediction3)  # Expected: 1 (Certificate Taken)
print("Nodes:", nodes3)            # Expected Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

**Summary:**

The `predict` function utilizes the most significant features from your dataset to classify whether a student is likely to have taken the school leaving certificate. By following the structure of your decision tree and using meaningful threshold values, the function provides a clear and interpretable prediction along with the decision path taken.
