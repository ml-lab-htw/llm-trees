Certainly! Based on the decision tree we constructed earlier, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, and it returns a prediction (0 for "Not Taken", 1 for "Taken") along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries in the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

**Decision Tree Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if `Type_school` is equal to `0` (primary_terminal_leaver).
  - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), then predict **"Not Taken"**.
  - If **No** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to Node 1.
- **Node 1:** For `Type_school` not equal to `0`, checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5`.
  - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), then predict **"Not Taken"**.
  - If **No** (`nodes[1] = 0`), then predict **"Taken"**.

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if Type_school == 0 (primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Type_school'] == 0 else 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver, predict Not Taken
        prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated in this case
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Educational_level <= 5
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['Educational_level'] <= 5 else 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Educational_level <= 5, predict Not Taken
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            # If Educational_level > 5, predict Taken
            prediction = 1  # Taken
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Example Usage:**

Suppose we have a student with the following feature values:

```python
student_features = {
    'Sex': 0,                # Female
    'DVRT': 50,              # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,    # Father's occupation prestige score
    'Type_school': 1         # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(student_features)
print("Prediction:", "Taken" if prediction == 1 else "Not Taken")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Taken
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0]
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0` because `Type_school` is not `0`.
  - `nodes[1] = 0` because `Educational_level` is `8`, which is greater than `5`.
  - Since `nodes[1] = 0`, the function predicts `1` (Taken).

**Feature Key Reference:**

- **Features:**
  - `'Sex'`: Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)
  - `'DVRT'`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
  - `'Educational_level'`: Educational level attained
    - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
    - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
    - `2`: Unknown
    - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
    - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
    - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - `'Prestige_score'`: Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
  - `'Type_school'`: Type of school
    - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
    - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
    - `2`: vocational

- **Target Variable:**
  - `school leaving certificate is taken or not` (0 = Not Taken, 1 = Taken)

**Notes:**

- The function uses the most significant features based on the decision tree: `'Type_school'` and `'Educational_level'`.
- The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes[0]`: `1` if `Type_school` is `0` (primary_terminal_leaver), else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: `1` if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5`, else `0`. This node is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `0`.
- The thresholds and conditions are based on meaningful values extracted from the data and the decision tree.
- If a node is not evaluated (due to a previous condition), its value in the `nodes` list is set to `None`.

**Ensure that when using this function:**

- All feature values are correctly encoded as per the provided encodings.
- The input dictionary `X` must contain all the necessary keys with the exact spelling and casing.
