**Adjusted Decision Tree:**

```plaintext
|--- Educational_level <= 2
|    |--- Class: Takes school leaving certificate (1)
|--- Educational_level > 2
|    |--- Type_school == 1
|    |    |--- Class: Takes school leaving certificate (1)
|    |--- Type_school != 1
|    |    |--- Class: Does not take school leaving certificate (0)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to 2.
  - **Educational_level Encoding:**
    - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
    - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
    - `2`: Unknown (`?`)
    - Lower values indicate higher educational attainment.
- **Node 1:** If `Educational_level` > 2, checks if `Type_school` equals `1` (secondary_terminal_leaver).
  - **Type_school Encoding:**
    - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
    - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
    - `2`: vocational

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Educational_level <= 2
    nodes[0] = X['Educational_level'] <= 2

    # Node 1: Type_school == 1
    # This node is only evaluated if Node 0 is False (Educational_level > 2)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['Type_school'] == 1
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Not evaluated

    # Decision Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Takes school leaving certificate
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Takes school leaving certificate
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Does not take school leaving certificate

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False, None remains None)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input features
X_sample = {
    'Sex': 0,                          # Female
    'DVRT': 50,                        # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 1,            # 3rd_level_incomplete
    'Prestige_score': 20,              # Father's occupation prestige score
    'Type_school': 1                   # secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", prediction)       # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)                 # Output: Nodes: [1, None]
```

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **nodes[0]:** Represents the condition `Educational_level <= 2`.
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
- **nodes[1]:** Represents the condition `Type_school == 1`.
  - Evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., `Educational_level > 2`).
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
  - `None` if not evaluated.

**Notes:**

- The function strictly adheres to the exact feature keys and encodings you've specified.
- The `nodes` list provides a trace of the decision path:
  - Each entry corresponds to an inner node's condition.
  - `1` if the condition is **True**.
  - `0` if the condition is **False**.
  - `None` if the condition was not evaluated (due to the structure of the tree).

**Understanding the Decision Path:**

- If a student's **Educational_level** is less than or equal to `2` (which corresponds to higher education levels), they are predicted to **take** the school leaving certificate.
- If their **Educational_level** is greater than `2`, the decision depends on the **Type_school**:
  - If they attend a **secondary_terminal_leaver** school (`Type_school == 1`), they are predicted to **take** the certificate.
  - Otherwise, they are predicted **not to take** the certificate.

**Final Remarks:**

- This function encapsulates the decision-making process of the decision tree you provided.
- It allows for easy integration into larger codebases where predictions based on these features are required.
- The `nodes` list can be used for debugging or understanding which conditions were met during the prediction.
