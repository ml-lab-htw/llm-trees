```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Since the tree has only one inner node
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 1)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # School leaving certificate is taken
    else:
        prediction = 0  # School leaving certificate is not taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - **Type_school**: Type of school
    - `0` = primary_terminal_leaver
    - `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver
    - `2` = vocational

- **Decision Logic:**
  - The decision tree splits on the `Type_school` feature.
  - **Inner Node Condition:** `X["Type_school"] == 1`
    - Checks if the student attended a **secondary_terminal_leaver** school.
  - **Node Truth Value:**
    - `nodes[0]` is `1` if the condition is satisfied (True), and `0` otherwise (False).

- **Prediction:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1`, the prediction is `1` (school leaving certificate **is taken**).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0`, the prediction is `0` (school leaving certificate **is not taken**).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example where the student attended a secondary_terminal_leaver school
X_example = {
    'Sex': 0,                # Female
    'DVRT': 45,              # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
    'Educational_level': 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 15,    # Prestige score for father's occupation
    'Type_school': 1         # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

**Alternate Example:**

```python
# Example where the student attended a vocational school
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,                # Male
    'DVRT': 38,
    'Educational_level': 9,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    'Prestige_score': 12,
    'Type_school': 2         # Vocational
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: Nodes: [0]
```

**Function Details:**

- **Function Name:** `predict`
- **Parameters:** `X` (a dictionary containing the features)
- **Returns:**
  - `prediction`: An integer (`0` or `1`) indicating whether the school leaving certificate is taken.
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value (`1` or `0`) of the inner node condition.

**Feature Keys and Encodings (for clarity):**

- `'Sex'`: Sex of child
  - `0` = female
  - `1` = male
- `'DVRT'`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
- `'Educational_level'`: Educational level attained
  - `0` = 3rd_level_complete
  - `1` = 3rd_level_incomplete
  - `2` = ?
  - `3` = Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `4` = Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `5` = Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - `6` = Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
  - `7` = Primary_terminal_leaver
  - `8` = Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `9` = Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `10` = Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
- `'Prestige_score'`: Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)
- `'Type_school'`: Type of school
  - `0` = primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2` = vocational

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `target`: School leaving certificate is taken or not
  - `0` = not taken
  - `1` = taken

**Usage Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values.
- This decision tree uses only the `Type_school` feature for prediction, with a maximum depth of 1.
- The `nodes` list will have a length equal to the number of inner nodes in the tree (in this case, 1).

**Additional Context:**

- The decision to use `Type_school` as the splitting criterion is based on its significance in predicting whether a student takes the school leaving certificate.
- Students attending **secondary_terminal_leaver** schools are more likely to take the certificate compared to those from **primary_terminal_leaver** or **vocational** schools.
