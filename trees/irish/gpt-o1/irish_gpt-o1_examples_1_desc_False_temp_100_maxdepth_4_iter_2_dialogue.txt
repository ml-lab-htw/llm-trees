def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # List to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Type_school == 0 (primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Type_school'] == 0 else 0

    # Node 1: Educational_level <= 4
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['Educational_level'] <= 4 else 0

    # Node 2: DVRT <= 50
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['DVRT'] <= 50 else 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver
        prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If Educational_level <= 4
            prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If DVRT <= 50
                prediction = 0  # Certificate Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Certificate Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `Type_school == 0` (primary_terminal_leaver).
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `Educational_level <= 4`.
  - `nodes[2]` corresponds to the condition `DVRT <= 50`.
  - Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

- **Decision Flow:**
  - **If** `Type_school` is `primary_terminal_leaver` (node 0 is `1`):
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Certificate Not Taken)
  - **Else:**
    - **If** `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `4` (node 1 is `1`):
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Certificate Not Taken)
    - **Else:**
      - **If** `DVRT` is less than or equal to `50` (node 2 is `1`):
        - **Prediction:** `0` (Certificate Not Taken)
      - **Else:**
        - **Prediction:** `1` (Certificate Taken)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,
    'DVRT': 55,
    'Educational_level': 5,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - The student is predicted to have **Taken** the school leaving certificate (`prediction = 1`).
  - The nodes list `[0, 0, 0]` indicates that none of the conditions were satisfied in this path.
