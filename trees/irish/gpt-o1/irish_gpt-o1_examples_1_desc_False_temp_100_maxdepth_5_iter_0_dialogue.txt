```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to store node conditions

    # Node 0: Check if Type_school is primary_terminal_leaver (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Type_school'] == 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Did not take the school leaving certificate
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Educational_level <= 5
        nodes[1] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 5)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied
            prediction = 0  # Did not take the school leaving certificate
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if DVRT <= 60
            nodes[2] = int(X['DVRT'] <= 60)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Node 2 condition is satisfied
                prediction = 0  # Did not take the school leaving certificate
            else:
                # Node 3: Check if Prestige_score <= 14
                nodes[3] = int(X['Prestige_score'] <= 14)
                if nodes[3]:
                    # If Node 3 condition is satisfied
                    prediction = 0  # Did not take the school leaving certificate
                else:
                    # Node 4: Check if Sex == 1 (male)
                    nodes[4] = int(X['Sex'] == 1)
                    if nodes[4]:
                        # If Node 4 condition is satisfied
                        prediction = 1  # Took the school leaving certificate
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Did not take the school leaving certificate
    # Fill in any unused nodes with 0
    for i in range(len(nodes)):
        if nodes[i] is None:
            nodes[i] = 0
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

This function follows the decision tree logic step by step:

1. **Node 0**:
   - **Condition**: `Type_school` is `primary_terminal_leaver` (encoded as `0`).
   - **Action**:
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`): Predict `0` (did not take the certificate).
     - If **No** (`nodes[0] = 0`): Proceed to **Node 1**.

2. **Node 1**:
   - **Condition**: `Educational_level` ≤ `5`.
   - **Action**:
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`): Predict `0`.
     - If **No** (`nodes[1] = 0`): Proceed to **Node 2**.

3. **Node 2**:
   - **Condition**: `DVRT` ≤ `60`.
   - **Action**:
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`): Predict `0`.
     - If **No** (`nodes[2] = 0`): Proceed to **Node 3**.

4. **Node 3**:
   - **Condition**: `Prestige_score` ≤ `14`.
   - **Action**:
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[3] = 1`): Predict `0`.
     - If **No** (`nodes[3] = 0`): Proceed to **Node 4**.

5. **Node 4**:
   - **Condition**: `Sex` == `1` (male).
   - **Action**:
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[4] = 1`): Predict `1` (took the certificate).
     - If **No** (`nodes[4] = 0`): Predict `0`.

**Feature Encodings:**

- `'Sex'`: `0` = female, `1` = male
- `'DVRT'`: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score (numeric)
- `'Educational_level'`:

  | Code | Description                                         |
  |------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | 0    | 3rd_level_complete                                  |
  | 1    | 3rd_level_incomplete                                |
  | 2    | Unknown/Other                                       |
  | 3    | Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school            |
  | 4    | Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school           |
  | 5    | Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school       |
  | 6    | Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school      |
  | 7    | Primary_terminal_leaver                             |
  | 8    | Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school            |
  | 9    | Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school           |
  | 10   | Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school       |

- `'Prestige_score'`: Ranges from `0` to `28`
- `'Type_school'`: `0` = primary_terminal_leaver, `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver, `2` = vocational

**Target Variable:**

- `0` = Did not take the school leaving certificate
- `1` = Took the school leaving certificate

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,                # Male
    'DVRT': 75,              # High DVRT score
    'Educational_level': 8,  # Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
    'Prestige_score': 18,    # High prestige score
    'Type_school': 1         # Secondary_terminal_leaver
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Prediction**: `1` (Took the school leaving certificate)
- **Nodes**:
  - `Node 0`: `0` (Type_school is not primary_terminal_leaver)
  - `Node 1`: `0` (Educational_level > 5)
  - `Node 2`: `0` (DVRT > 60)
  - `Node 3`: `0` (Prestige_score > 14)
  - `Node 4`: `1` (Sex == male)

**Notes:**

- If any of the conditions at Nodes 0 to 3 are satisfied (`nodes[i] = 1`), the function might predict `0` based on the tree logic.
- The conditions are applied sequentially, and the decision to proceed to the next node depends on the previous node's outcome.
- The function ensures that all entries in `nodes` are set to `1` or `0`, even if some nodes are not reached due to earlier predictions.

**Key Points:**

- **Maximum Depth**: The tree has a maximum depth of 5, as required.
- **Most Important Features**: The tree uses the most impactful features based on the assumed relationships:
  - `Type_school`
  - `Educational_level`
  - `DVRT`
  - `Prestige_score`
  - `Sex`

- **Assumptions**: Since we don't have actual data, the thresholds (like DVRT ≤ 60) are set based on plausible values.
- **Feature Importance**: Features are ordered in the tree based on their assumed significance in predicting the target variable.

**Remember:** This decision tree is a hypothetical model built on the given features and feature encodings. In a real-world scenario, the thresholds and feature importance would be determined by training the model on actual data.
