```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize list for inner node truth values

    # Node 0: Check if Type_school == 0 (primary_terminal_leaver)
    nodes[0] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If True, class: Not Taken (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Educational_level <= 5
        nodes[1] = int(X["Educational_level"] <= 5)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if DVRT <= 45
            nodes[2] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 45)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If True, class: Not Taken (0)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # If False, class: Taken (1)
                prediction = 1
        else:
            # If Educational_level > 5, class: Taken (1)
            prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if `Type_school` is `0` (primary_terminal_leaver). If this condition is true (`nodes[0] = 1`), the student has not taken the certificate (`prediction = 0`).
- **nodes[1]:** If `Type_school` is not `0`, checks if `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5`. This represents lower educational attainment levels.
- **nodes[2]:** If `Educational_level` is less than or equal to `5`, checks if `DVRT` (Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score) is less than or equal to `45`. A lower DVRT score suggests a lower likelihood of taking the certificate.
- The function returns the `prediction` (0 for Not Taken, 1 for Taken) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values of the conditions (1 if true, 0 if false).

**Note on Feature Values:**

- **Type_school:** Encoded as:
  - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2`: vocational
- **Educational_level:** Encoded numerical values from `0` to `10` representing different levels of educational attainment.
- **DVRT:** Numerical score representing the Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example feature input
X_example = {
    'Sex': 1,  # 0 = female, 1 = male
    'DVRT': 50,
    'Educational_level': 4,
    'Prestige_score': 15,
    'Type_school': 1  # 0 = primary_terminal_leaver, 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver, 2 = vocational
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Taken' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Taken'}")
print(f"Inner Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Taken
Inner Node Truth Values: [0, 1, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] = 0` because `Type_school` is not `0`.
- `nodes[1] = 1` because `Educational_level` is `4` (which is `<= 5`).
- `nodes[2] = 0` because `DVRT` is `50` (which is `> 45`).
- The prediction is `1` (Taken) because the DVRT score is higher than `45`.
