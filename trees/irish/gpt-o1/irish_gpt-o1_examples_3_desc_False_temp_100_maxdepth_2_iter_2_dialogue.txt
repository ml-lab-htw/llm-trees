Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the features provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing feature values, returns the prediction (`0` for "Not Taken", `1` for "Taken"), and a list of truth values corresponding to the inner nodes of the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the Type of School is 'Primary Terminal Leaver' (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = X["Type_school"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the student is in a Primary Terminal Leaver school, they do not take the certificate
        prediction = 0  # Does Not Take School Leaving Certificate
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the Educational Level Attained is greater than or equal to 5
        nodes[1] = X["Educational_level"] >= 5
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Educational Level is >= 5, the student takes the certificate
            prediction = 1  # Takes School Leaving Certificate
        else:
            # If Educational Level is < 5, the student does not take the certificate
            prediction = 0  # Does Not Take School Leaving Certificate
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` with two elements, corresponding to the two inner nodes in the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates the condition of the first node.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates the condition of the second node (only if the first node's condition is not satisfied).

- **Conditions:**
  1. **Node 0:** `X["Type_school"] == 0`
     - Checks if the student's school type is **'Primary Terminal Leaver'**.
     - If **True**, the student does **not** take the school leaving certificate.
  
  2. **Node 1:** `X["Educational_level"] >= 5`
     - Evaluates only if `nodes[0]` is **False** (i.e., the student is not in a Primary Terminal Leaver school).
     - Checks if the **Educational Level Attained** is **greater than or equal to 5**.
     - If **True**, the student **takes** the school leaving certificate.
     - If **False**, the student does **not** take the certificate.

**Feature Encoding Reference:**

- **Sex:**
  - `0`: Female
  - `1`: Male

- **DVRT:**
  - Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score (numeric value).

- **Educational_level:**
  - `0`: 3rd_level_complete
  - `1`: 3rd_level_incomplete
  - `2`: Unknown (?)
  - `3`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `4`: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `5`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - `6`: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
  - `7`: Primary_terminal_leaver
  - `8`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - `9`: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - `10`: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school

- **Prestige_score:**
  - Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28).

- **Type_school:**
  - `0`: primary_terminal_leaver
  - `1`: secondary_terminal_leaver
  - `2`: vocational

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: School leaving certificate **not taken**.
- `1`: School leaving certificate **taken**.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a student with the following features:

```python
X_example = {
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "DVRT": 50,  # Example score
    "Educational_level": 6,  # Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
    "Prestige_score": 15,  # Father's occupation prestige score
    "Type_school": 2  # Vocational school
}
```

We can predict whether this student takes the school leaving certificate:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Taken" if prediction == 1 else "Not Taken")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Taken
Nodes Truth Values: [False, True]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Node 0:** `False` (Student is not in a Primary Terminal Leaver school).
- **Node 1:** `True` (Educational Level Attained is greater than or equal to 5).
- **Final Prediction:** The student **takes** the school leaving certificate.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the feature values provided in `X` match the exact keys and encodings specified.
- This function strictly follows the decision tree structure with a maximum depth of 2 using the most significant features identified.
