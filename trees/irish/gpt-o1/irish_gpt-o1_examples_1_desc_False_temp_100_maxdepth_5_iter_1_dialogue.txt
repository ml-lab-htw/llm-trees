```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Evaluate the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 55.0)  # Node 0: DVRT <= 55.0
    nodes[1] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)  # Node 1: Type_school == 0 (Primary Terminal Leaver)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Prestige_score"] <= 15.0)  # Node 2: Prestige_score <= 15.0

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # If DVRT <= 55.0
        if nodes[1]:  # If Type_school == Primary Terminal Leaver
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If Prestige_score <= 15.0
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the root node condition: `DVRT <= 55.0`.
- **nodes[1]** corresponds to the condition: `Type_school == 0` (where `0` represents "primary_terminal_leaver").
- **nodes[2]** corresponds to the condition: `Prestige_score <= 15.0`.

Each entry in the `nodes` list is set to `1` if the condition is **satisfied** (True) and `0` otherwise.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **"Sex"**: Sex of the child (`0` = female, `1` = male)
- **"DVRT"**: Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score
- **"Educational_level"**: Educational level attained (encoded from `0` to `10` as per your encoding)
- **"Prestige_score"**: Prestige score for father's occupation (ranging from `0` to `28`)
- **"Type_school"**: Type of school (`0` = primary_terminal_leaver, `1` = secondary_terminal_leaver, `2` = vocational)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **Prediction**: `0` for "Not Taken", `1` for "Taken"

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input data
X_example = {
    "Sex": 1,
    "DVRT": 50,
    "Educational_level": 6,
    "Prestige_score": 12,
    "Type_school": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [1, 1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0] = 1**: The condition `DVRT <= 55.0` is satisfied.
- **nodes[1] = 1**: The condition `Type_school == 0` is satisfied.
- **nodes[2] = 1**: The condition `Prestige_score <= 15.0` is satisfied (though in this path, the prediction is already made before this node).

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree structure you provided.
- The thresholds (`55.0` for DVRT and `15.0` for Prestige_score) are meaningful values based on the decision nodes in the tree.
- The feature keys match exactly with the ones you've specified, respecting the spelling and casing.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`) during the prediction.

**Complete Function Ready for Use:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Evaluate the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = int(X["DVRT"] <= 55.0)  # Node 0: DVRT <= 55.0
    nodes[1] = int(X["Type_school"] == 0)  # Node 1: Type_school == 0 (Primary Terminal Leaver)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Prestige_score"] <= 15.0)  # Node 2: Prestige_score <= 15.0

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # If DVRT <= 55.0
        if nodes[1]:  # If Type_school == Primary Terminal Leaver
            prediction = 0  # Not Taken
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If Prestige_score <= 15.0
                prediction = 0  # Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Taken
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Taken

    return prediction, nodes
```
