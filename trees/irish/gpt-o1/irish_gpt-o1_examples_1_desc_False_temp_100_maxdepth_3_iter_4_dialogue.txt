Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Type_school is 'primary_terminal_leaver' (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Type_school'] == 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # School Leaving Certificate Not Taken
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Educational_level is less than or equal to 5
        nodes[1] = int(X['Educational_level'] <= 5)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if Prestige_score is less than or equal to 15
            nodes[2] = int(X['Prestige_score'] <= 15)
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # School Leaving Certificate Not Taken
            else:
                prediction = 1  # School Leaving Certificate Taken
        else:
            prediction = 1  # School Leaving Certificate Taken
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `Type_school`:
    - 0 = primary_terminal_leaver
    - 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver
    - 2 = vocational
  - `Educational_level`: Encoded from 0 to 10 (see descriptions below)
  - `Prestige_score`: Ranges from 0 to 28

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the student is from a primary_terminal_leaver school.
    - `nodes[0] = 1` if `Type_school == 0`
    - If `nodes[0]` is `1`, predict `0` (Not Taken)
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the Educational_level is less than or equal to 5.
    - This distinguishes lower educational attainment.
    - `nodes[1] = 1` if `Educational_level <= 5`
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the Prestige_score is less than or equal to 15.
    - A lower prestige score might influence the likelihood of not taking the certificate.
    - `nodes[2] = 1` if `Prestige_score <= 15`

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1`:
    - The student is from a primary_terminal_leaver school.
    - **Prediction:** `0` (School Leaving Certificate Not Taken)
  - Else:
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1`:
      - The student's educational level is low (<= 5).
      - If `nodes[2]` is `1`:
        - Prestige_score is low (<=15).
        - **Prediction:** `0` (Not Taken)
      - Else:
        - Prestige_score is high (>15).
        - **Prediction:** `1` (Taken)
    - Else:
      - Educational_level is high (>5).
      - **Prediction:** `1` (School Leaving Certificate Taken)

**Feature Encodings and Descriptions:**

- **Sex:** Sex of child (0 = female, 1 = male)

- **DVRT:** Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score

- **Educational_level:** Educational level attained
  - 0: 3rd_level_complete
  - 1: 3rd_level_incomplete
  - 2: Unknown
  - 3: Junior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - 4: Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - 5: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school
  - 6: Junior_cycle_terminal_leaver-vocational_school
  - 7: Primary_terminal_leaver
  - 8: Senior_cycle_incomplete-secondary_school
  - 9: Senior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
  - 10: Senior_cycle_terminal_leaver-secondary_school

- **Prestige_score:** Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28)

- **Type_school:** Type of school
  - 0 = primary_terminal_leaver
  - 1 = secondary_terminal_leaver
  - 2 = vocational

**Target Variable:**

- **School leaving certificate is taken or not**
  - `0` = Not Taken
  - `1` = Taken

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a student's data:

```python
student = {
    'Sex': 1,                   # Male
    'DVRT': 50,                 # Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test score
    'Educational_level': 4,     # Junior_cycle_incomplete-vocational_school
    'Prestige_score': 12,       # Father's occupation prestige score
    'Type_school': 1            # secondary_terminal_leaver
}
```

Predicting:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(student)
print("Prediction:", "Taken" if prediction == 1 else "Not Taken")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Not Taken
Nodes: [0, 1, 1]
```

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The student is not from a primary_terminal_leaver school.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: Educational_level is less than or equal to 5.
  - `nodes[2] = 1`: Prestige_score is less than or equal to 15.
- **Prediction:** Based on the rules, the student is predicted **Not to Take** the school leaving certificate.

**Note:**

- The thresholds (e.g., `Educational_level <= 5`, `Prestige_score <= 15`) are selected to reflect meaningful splits based on the presumed influence of these factors on the outcome.
- The function can be used to predict the outcome for any student by providing their feature values in a dictionary with the exact keys specified.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into the path taken in the decision tree for each prediction.
