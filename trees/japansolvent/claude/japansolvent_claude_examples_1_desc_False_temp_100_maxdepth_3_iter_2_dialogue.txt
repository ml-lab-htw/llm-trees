Based on the features and their financial meaning, I'll create a prediction function with realistic threshold values for solvency classification.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store binary decisions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with realistic financial thresholds
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.02  # Profitability threshold
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.30  # Leverage threshold
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= -0.10  # Working capital threshold
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Low profitability
        if nodes[1]:  # Low equity ratio
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # Adequate equity ratio
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # Adequate profitability
        if nodes[2]:  # Negative working capital
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # Positive working capital
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds are set based on common financial benchmarks:
- EBIT/TA: 0.02 (2%) is a minimum profitability threshold
- Equity/TA: 0.30 (30%) represents a reasonable capital structure
- WC/TA: -0.10 (-10%) indicates critical working capital problems

The function returns both the prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and the list of boolean values for each decision node.
