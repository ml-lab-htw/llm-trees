I'll create a Python function for the solvency decision tree that returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: EBIT/TA <= 0.04
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.04
    
    # Second node: Equity/TA <= 0.30
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA is low (<=0.04)
        if nodes[1]:  # If Equity/TA is also low (<=0.30)
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # If Equity/TA is high (>0.30)
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA is high (>0.04)
        prediction = 1  # solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the conditions
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node: EBIT/TA <= 0.04 (profitability threshold)
   - Second node: Equity/TA <= 0.30 (leverage threshold)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds (0.04 for EBIT/TA and 0.30 for Equity/TA) are common benchmarks in financial analysis:
- EBIT/TA of 4% is a reasonable threshold for profitability
- Equity/TA of 30% represents a common minimum for financial stability
