Based on the provided feature names and their descriptions, I'll create a decision tree function using EBIT/TA as the main decision feature. Since this is a financial ratio, I'll use a realistic threshold value of 0.04 (4% return on assets):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node since depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.04
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.04
        prediction = 0  # insolvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.04
        prediction = 1  # solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the decision (EBIT/TA <= 0.04)
3. Makes a prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent) based on the decision
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values

The threshold of 0.04 (4%) for EBIT/TA is a reasonable value as:
- Companies with EBIT/TA > 4% typically have good operational efficiency
- Companies with EBIT/TA â‰¤ 4% might struggle to cover their obligations
