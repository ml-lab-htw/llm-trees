Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and target encoding you provided. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
        if nodes[1]:  # Equity/TA <= 0.30
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # Equity/TA > 0.30
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
        prediction = 1  # solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.02 (node[0])
4. If true, checks if Equity/TA is less than or equal to 0.30 (node[1])
5. Returns a tuple containing:
   - The prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent)
   - The list of node results

The thresholds (0.02 for EBIT/TA and 0.30 for Equity/TA) are meaningful values based on financial analysis:
- EBIT/TA <= 0.02 indicates very low profitability
- Equity/TA <= 0.30 indicates high leverage (low equity financing)
