Based on the provided feature names and the fact that EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets) is a key profitability ratio, I'll create a simple decision tree function with a realistic threshold:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03  # 3% threshold for EBIT/TA
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.03
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.03
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Uses a single decision node based on EBIT/TA with a threshold of 0.03 (3%)
3. Returns a tuple containing:
   - The prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent)
   - A list containing the truth value of the decision node

The 3% threshold for EBIT/TA is a reasonable value as:
- Companies with EBIT/TA below 3% typically struggle with profitability
- This ratio being positive but low (< 3%) often indicates operational difficulties
- Values above 3% generally indicate better operational efficiency and financial health
