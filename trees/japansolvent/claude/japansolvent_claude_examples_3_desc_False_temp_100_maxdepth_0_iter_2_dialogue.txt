Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for determining whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.30
    nodes[4] = X['Sales/TA'] <= 0.80

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values.

2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each condition in the decision tree and stores the result (True or False) in the `nodes` list.

4. It then uses these evaluations to navigate the decision tree and determine the final prediction.

5. The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: 1 if the company is predicted to be solvent, 0 if insolvent.
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The thresholds used in this function are based on common financial ratios and are meant to be meaningful in the context of company solvency:

- EBIT/TA <= 0.05: This checks if the company's profitability relative to its assets is low.
- WC/
