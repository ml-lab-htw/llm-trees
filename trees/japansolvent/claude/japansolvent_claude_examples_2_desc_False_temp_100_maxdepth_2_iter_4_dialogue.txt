Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for company solvency:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.02  # Using NI/TC instead of NI/TC as it's the closest available feature
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= -0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.30:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanations:

1. I've used 'NI/TC' (Net Income/Total Capital) instead of 'Net Income/Total Assets' as it's the closest available feature in the provided list.

2. The thresholds are set based on common financial ratios and the earlier decision tree:
   - NI/TC <= 0.02 represents a low profitability threshold.
   - WC/TA <= -0.05 represents a negative working capital ratio, indicating potential liquidity issues.
   - Equity/TA <= 0.30 represents a moderate level of financial leverage.

3. The function returns a tuple containing:
   - The prediction: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent.
   - A list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node.

4. The tree structure follows the earlier design, with a maximum depth of 2.

5. Note that in this tree, companies with higher NI/TC (> 0.02) are always classified as solvent, regardless of their Equity/TA ratio. This simplification is due to the depth limit and the assumption that companies with good profitability are likely to be solvent.

This function provides a simple yet potentially effective way to classify companies based on key financial ratios, focusing on profitability, liquidity, and leverage
