Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific requirements you've outlined, here's the Python function that predicts whether a company is solvent or not, using a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the changes and decisions:

1. I've used the exact keys as provided in the feature list.
2. The target variable encoding is used as specified: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent.
3. I've adjusted the threshold values to be more meaningful based on typical financial ratios:
   - For WC/TA (Working Capital / Total Assets), a value of 0.1 or 10% is a reasonable threshold.
   - For EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets), 0.03 or 3% is a conservative profitability threshold.
   - For Equity/TA (Equity / Total Assets), 0.3 or 30% is a reasonable threshold for solvency.
4. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
5. The decision tree structure maintains a maximum depth of 2, using three key financial ratios to make the classification.

This function should correctly classify companies as solvent (1) or insolvent (0) based on the provided financial ratios, while also returning the boolean values for each decision node in the tree.
