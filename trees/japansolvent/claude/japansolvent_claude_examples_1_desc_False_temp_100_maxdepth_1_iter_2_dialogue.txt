Based on the features and their descriptions, I'll create a decision function for the simple decision tree using EBIT/TA as the main decision feature. I'll use a threshold of 0.03 (3%) which is a reasonable boundary for distinguishing between solvent and insolvent companies based on return on assets.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one decision node in this tree with depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.03
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.03
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Has one decision node checking if EBIT/TA <= 0.03
3. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent
   - nodes: list containing one boolean value representing whether EBIT/TA <= 0.03 is True (1) or False (0)

The threshold of 0.03 (3%) for EBIT/TA is a reasonable value as companies with return on assets below this level often struggle to maintain solvency.
