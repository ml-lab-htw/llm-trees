Based on the provided feature names and encoding, here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier I described earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.03  # First split on profitability
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.25  # Second split on solvency
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If low profitability
        if nodes[1]:  # If low equity ratio
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # If higher equity ratio
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # If higher profitability
        prediction = 1  # solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds are set to reasonable values:
- EBIT/TA threshold of 0.03 (3%) represents a minimal level of profitability
- Equity/TA threshold of 0.25 (25%) represents a minimal level of equity financing

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns:
1. A prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent)
2. A list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
