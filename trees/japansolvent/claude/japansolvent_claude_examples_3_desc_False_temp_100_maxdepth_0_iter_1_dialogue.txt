Based on your instructions and the provided examples, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for classifying whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    nodes[3] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.02
    nodes[4] = X["Sales/TA"] <= 0.80

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree we discussed earlier. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the financial ratios.
2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the boolean results of each condition in the tree.
3. It evaluates each condition and stores the result in the `nodes` list.
4. It then uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent
   - `nodes`: a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the tree

The thresholds used in this function are based on typical financial ratio benchmarks:

- EBIT/TA <= 0.05: This suggests low profitability relative to assets.
- WC/TA <= 0.10: This indicates potential liquidity issues.
- Equity/TA <=
