Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for company solvency:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the financial ratios.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the results (True = 1, False = 0) in the `nodes` list.
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. Returns the prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used are:
- EBIT/TA: 0.05
- WC/TA: 0.10
- Equity/TA: 0.30

These thresholds are based on typical financial ratio benchmarks, but they may need to be adjusted based on the specific industry or market conditions of the companies being evaluated.
