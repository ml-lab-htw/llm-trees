Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using EBIT/TA and Equity/TA as the main decision nodes, with meaningful thresholds based on common financial benchmarks.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: EBIT/TA <= 0.02 (2% return on assets threshold)
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    # Second decision node: Equity/TA <= 0.30 (30% equity ratio threshold)
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low profitability
        if nodes[1]:  # Low equity ratio
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # Higher equity ratio
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # Higher profitability
        prediction = 1  # solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds are chosen based on common financial benchmarks:
- EBIT/TA threshold of 0.02 (2%) represents a minimal acceptable return on assets
- Equity/TA threshold of 0.30 (30%) represents a reasonable equity ratio for financial stability

The function returns:
1. A prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent)
2. A list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The logic follows that:
- Companies with good profitability (EBIT/TA > 0.02) are classified as solvent
- Companies with lower profitability but good equity ratio (Equity/TA > 0.30) are still solvent
- Companies with both low profitability and low equity ratio are classified as insolvent
