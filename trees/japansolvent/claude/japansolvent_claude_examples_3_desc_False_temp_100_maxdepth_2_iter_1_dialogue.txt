Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, using the most important features to predict whether a company is solvent or not. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the financial ratios for a company.
2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. The decision tree uses three key ratios:
   - EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets)
   - WC/TA (Working Capital / Total Assets)
   - Equity/TA (Equity / Total Assets)
4. The thresholds are set based on general financial principles:
   - EBIT/TA <= 0.05: This indicates low profitability relative to assets.
   - WC/TA <= 0.10: This suggests potential liquidity issues.
   - Equity/TA <= 0.30: This implies high leverage (low equity relative to assets).
5. The function returns a tuple containing:
   - The prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent)
   - The list of node truth values

This decision tree first checks the company's profitability (EBIT/TA). If it's low, it then looks at liquidity (WC/TA). If profitability is higher, it examines the company's leverage (Equity/TA
