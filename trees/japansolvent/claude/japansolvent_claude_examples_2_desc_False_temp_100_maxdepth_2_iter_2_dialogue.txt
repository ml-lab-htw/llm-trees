Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific requirements you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for company solvency:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10 if nodes[0] else X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - The first node checks if EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.05
   - The second node's condition depends on the result of the first node:
     - If EBIT/TA <= 0.05, it checks if WC/TA <= 0.10
     - If EBIT/TA > 0.05, it checks if Equity/TA <= 0.30
4. Determines the prediction based on the node conditions:
   - 0 represents an insolvent company
   - 1 represents a solvent company
5. Returns the prediction and the list of node truth values

The thresholds used (0.05, 0.10, and 0.30) are meaningful values for these financial ratios:
- EBIT/TA <= 0.05 indicates low profitability relative to assets
- WC/TA <= 0.10 suggests poor short-term financial health
- Equity/TA <= 0.30 implies high leverage and potentially poor long-term solvency

This function adheres to
