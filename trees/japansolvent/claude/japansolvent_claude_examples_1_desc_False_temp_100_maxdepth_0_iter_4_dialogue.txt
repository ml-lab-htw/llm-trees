Based on the financial ratios and their typical ranges, I'll create a decision tree function that makes economically meaningful predictions about company solvency:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check profitability
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    # Node 1: Check working capital position
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    
    # Node 2: Check equity ratio
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.20
    
    # Node 3: Check debt coverage
    nodes[3] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.30
    
    # Node 4: Check return on capital
    nodes[4] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.01
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low profitability
        if nodes[1]:  # Negative working capital
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Low equity ratio
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # Adequate profitability
        if nodes[3]:  # Low debt coverage
            if nodes[4]:  # Low return on capital
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses realistic threshold values:
- EBIT/TA: 0.02 (2% return on assets)
- WC/TA: -0.10 (-10% working capital ratio)
- Equity/TA: 0.20 (20% equity ratio)
- Equity/TL: 0.30 (30% equity to liability ratio)
- NI/TC: 0.01 (1% return on capital)

The prediction returns 1 for solvent companies and 0 for in
