Based on the decision tree I created earlier and following the format you've provided, here's the Python function that predicts whether a company is solvent or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the financial ratios.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 3 elements (for a depth-2 tree), initially set to `None`.

3. We fill the `nodes` list with boolean values based on the conditions in our decision tree:
   - `nodes[0]`: Is EBIT/TA <= 0.05?
   - `nodes[1]`: Is WC/TA <= 0.10?
   - `nodes[2]`: Is Equity/TA <= 0.30?

4. We then use these conditions to determine the prediction:
   - If EBIT/TA <= 0.05 (nodes[0] is True):
     - If WC/TA <= 0.10 (nodes[1] is True), predict Insolvent (0)
     - Otherwise, predict Solvent (1)
   - If EBIT/TA > 0.05 (nodes[0] is False):
     - If Equity/TA <= 0.30 (nodes[2] is True), predict Insolvent (0)
     - Otherwise, predict Solvent (1)

5. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for
