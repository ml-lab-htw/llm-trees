I'll create a Python function for the solvency decision tree that returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for a tree with depth 2 (2 inner nodes)
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check EBIT/TA ratio
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    # Second node: Check Equity/TA ratio (only evaluated if EBIT/TA is low)
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.02
        if nodes[1]:  # If Equity/TA <= 0.30
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # If Equity/TA > 0.30
            prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.02
        prediction = 1  # solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the conditions
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node checks if EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.02 (2%)
   - Second node checks if Equity/TA is less than or equal to 0.30 (30%)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition

The thresholds (0.02 for EBIT/TA and 0.30 for Equity/TA) are common benchmarks in financial analysis:
- EBIT/TA ≤ 0.02 indicates very low profitability
- Equity/TA ≤ 0.30 indicates high leverage (low equity cushion)
