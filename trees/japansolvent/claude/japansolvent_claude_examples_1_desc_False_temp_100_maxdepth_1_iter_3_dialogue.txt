Based on the provided feature names and format, here's the decision tree function that uses EBIT/TA as the main decision criterion with a meaningful threshold:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node since max_depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.04  # 4% threshold for EBIT/Total Assets
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.04
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.04
        prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Uses EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets) as the decision criterion
3. Uses a threshold of 0.04 (4%), which is a reasonable threshold for this ratio
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list of node conditions
5. The nodes list contains a single boolean value since the tree has a depth of 1

The threshold of 0.04 is chosen because companies with EBIT/TA below 4% typically struggle to generate sufficient returns from their assets, which could indicate potential solvency issues.
