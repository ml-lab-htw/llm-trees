Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided format, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for company solvency:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result (True = 1, False = 0) in the `nodes` list.
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. Returns the prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used are:
- EBIT/TA: 0.05 (5% profitability relative to total assets)
- WC/TA: 0.10 (10% working capital relative to total assets)
- Equity/TA: 0.30 (30% equity relative to total assets)

These thresholds are based on general financial principles and common benchmarks, but they may need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset or industry standards.
