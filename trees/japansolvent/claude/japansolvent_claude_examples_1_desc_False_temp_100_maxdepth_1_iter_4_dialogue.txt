Based on the features and their typical financial ratio ranges, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree with EBIT/TA as the main decision feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.13  # 13% threshold for EBIT/TA
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.13
        prediction = 0  # insolvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.13
        prediction = 1  # solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the condition
3. Checks if EBIT/TA is <= 0.13 (13% threshold)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition

The threshold of 0.13 (13%) for EBIT/TA is a reasonable value as:
- Companies with EBIT/TA > 13% typically show good operational efficiency
- Companies with EBIT/TA â‰¤ 13% might struggle to generate sufficient returns from their assets
