Certainly! Below is the Python function representing the decision tree classifier based on the specified features, which returns a prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list for the nodes (inner conditions)
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check Equity/Total Liabilities (Equity/TL) <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Check Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        # Node 2: Check Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.1
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    # Return the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the first decision point: `Equity/TL <= 1.0`.
- **nodes[1]** is determined by the path taken based on the result of **nodes[0]**:
  - If **nodes[0]** is `True` (i.e., `Equity/TL <= 1.0`), we check **EBIT/TA** (the second decision).
  - If **nodes[0]** is `False` (i.e., `Equity/TL > 1.0`), we instead check **WC/TA**.

### Example usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "NI/TC": 0.3,
    "Sales/TA": 1.2,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.15,
    "NI/Sales": 0.08,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 0.9,
    "Equity/TA": 0.5
}

# Call the function to get the prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Insolvent) or 1 (Solvent)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True] or [True, False], etc.
```

This function will now return the predicted class (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) based on the input feature values, along with a list of the boolean values representing the truth of the conditions at each node.
