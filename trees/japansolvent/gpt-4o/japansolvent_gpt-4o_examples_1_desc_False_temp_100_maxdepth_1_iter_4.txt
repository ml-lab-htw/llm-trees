Here is the decision tree for the Features and target variable ("company is solvent") with a depth of 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05  # Chose EBIT/TA as the most important feature for solvency
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
- The decision tree uses the ratio of **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets) as the most important feature to determine if a company is solvent.
- The threshold chosen is **0.05** (5%). If the EBIT/TA ratio is greater than 5%, the company is predicted to be solvent (1). Otherwise, it is predicted to be insolvent (0).
- This decision tree has a maximum depth of 1, with only one inner node (a single decision based on EBIT/TA). The list `nodes` contains a single boolean value representing whether the condition `X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05` is true or false.

Example usage:

```python
X_example = {"EBIT/TA": 0.07, "NI/TC": 0.03, "Sales/TA": 0.5, "EBIT/Sales": 0.1, "NI/Sales": 0.02, "WC/TA": 0.1, "Equity/TL": 0.8, "Equity/TA": 0.6}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (solvent)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True]
```

In this example:
- The EBIT/TA ratio is 0.07, which is greater than 0.05, so the company is predicted to be solvent (`prediction = 1`), and the condition at the inner node is satisfied (`nodes = [True]`).
