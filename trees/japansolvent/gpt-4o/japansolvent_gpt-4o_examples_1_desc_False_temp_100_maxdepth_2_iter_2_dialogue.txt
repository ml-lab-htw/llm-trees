Based on the decision tree structure I provided earlier, and considering the exact syntax of the features, here is the Python function that returns a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First decision node: EBIT/TA <= 0.08
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.08
        # Second decision node: Equity/TL <= 0.50
        nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.50
        if nodes[1]:  # If Equity/TL <= 0.50
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If Equity/TL > 0.50
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.08
        # Second decision node: NI/Sales <= 0.03
        nodes[1] = X["NI/Sales"] <= 0.03
        if nodes[1]:  # If NI/Sales <= 0.03
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If NI/Sales > 0.03
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Code:
- The function takes in a dictionary `X`, where the keys are the feature names (as provided) and the values are the feature values for a particular company.
- The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes (i.e., conditions at each decision point).
- The first split is based on the feature `"EBIT/TA"`: if it is less than or equal to 0.08, the function evaluates the next feature `"Equity/TL"`.
    - If `"Equity/TL"` is less than or equal to 0.50, the company is classified as insolvent.
    - Otherwise, it is classified as solvent.
- If `"EBIT/TA"` is greater than 0.08, the function evaluates the feature `"NI/Sales"`.
    - If `"NI/Sales"` is less than or equal to 0.03, the company is classified as insolvent.
    - Otherwise, it is classified as solvent.

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.07,
    "NI/TC": 0.12,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.1,
    "NI/Sales": 0.02,
    "WC/TA": 0.3,
    "Equity/TL": 0.6,
    "Equity/TA": 0.5,
    "target": 1  # This is not used in the function
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output:
```
Prediction: Solvent, Nodes: [True, False]
```

In this example, the first condition (`EBIT/TA <= 0.08`) is satisfied (True), but the second condition (`Equity/TL <= 0.50`) is not satisfied (False), leading to a classification of "Solvent".
