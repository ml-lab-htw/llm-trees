Below is the implementation of a Python function that uses our decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company is solvent. The function returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.20
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.1,
    "NI/TC": 0.05,
    "Sales/TA": 0.3,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.25,
    "NI/Sales": 0.1,
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "Equity/TL": 1.5,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Inner Nodes:", nodes)
```

Explanation of the code:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input.
- It initializes a list `nodes` to keep track of the truth values of the inner nodes.
- The first decision node checks if `"Equity/TL"` is less than or equal to 1.20.
- The second decision node checks if `"EBIT/TA"` is less than or equal to 0.08.
- The function then makes decisions based on these conditions and returns the classification (`1` for solvent, `0` for not solvent) along with the list of truth values of the nodes which indicate if the condition of each inner node is satisfied (1) or not (0).

This function adheres to a maximum depth of 2 as requested and uses the most important features as determined previously: `Equity/TL` and `EBIT/TA`.
