Certainly! Let's create a fully implemented Python function based on your provided context and feature keys that classify whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0). This function will use binary branching based on threshold values and return a prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Nodes will track the conditions at each decision point
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree conditions based on given features and reasonable thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.90
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.15

    # Decision tree classification based on nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
            
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X_example = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.12,
    'NI/TC': 0.16,
    'Sales/TA': 0.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.2,
    'NI/Sales': 0.1,
    'WC/TA': 0.06,
    'Equity/TL': 0.95,
    'Equity/TA': 0.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: Checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.10, indicating low profitability.
- **nodes[1]**: Checks if `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to 0.90, which could indicate financial instability.
- **nodes[2]**: Checks if `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05, indicating low liquidity.
- **nodes[3]**: Checks if `NI/TC` is less than or equal to 0.15, indicating low efficiency in using capital.

The function traverses these nodes to make a prediction based on the defined thresholds. Feel free to adjust the threshold values based on domain knowledge or further dataset analysis for better accuracy.
