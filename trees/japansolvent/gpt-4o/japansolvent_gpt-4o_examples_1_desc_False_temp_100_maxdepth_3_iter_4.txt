Here's a decision tree based on the Features and the target variable "company is solvent (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent)" with a depth of 3. The decision tree has 3 inner nodes and uses the most important features for predicting the solvency of a company.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if EBIT/TA is less or equal to 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: If EBIT/TA is <= 0.05, check if NI/TC is less or equal to 0.02
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.02
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: If NI/TC is <= 0.02, check if WC/TA is less or equal to 0.1
            nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # If WC/TA is <= 0.1, predict insolvent
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # If WC/TA is > 0.1, predict solvent
                prediction = 1
        else:
            # If NI/TC is > 0.02, predict solvent
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: If EBIT/TA is > 0.05, check if Equity/TA is greater than 0.3
        nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: If Equity/TA is > 0.3, predict solvent
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If Equity/TA is <= 0.3, predict insolvent
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
- **Node 0**: The first decision checks if the company's EBIT/TA ratio is less than or equal to 0.05. If it is, this might indicate that the company has low profitability relative to its assets, which could be a sign of insolvency.
- **Node 1**: If EBIT/TA is low (<= 0.05), the next check is whether the Net Income to Total Capital (NI/TC) is low (<= 0.02). Companies with very low net income relative to their capital might be at risk of insolvency.
- **Node 2**: If NI/TC is also low (<= 0.02), the Working Capital to Total Assets (WC/TA) ratio is checked. If WC/TA is very low (<= 0.1), it indicates a lack of liquidity, so the company is predicted to be insolvent.
- **Else branches**: If EBIT/TA is not low (> 0.05), the tree checks if the company's equity relative to its assets (Equity/TA) is sufficiently high (> 0.3). If so, the company is predicted to be solvent; otherwise, it's predicted to be insolvent.

### Features used:
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
- **NI/TC**: Net Income / Total Capital
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital / Total Assets
- **Equity/TA**: Equity / Total Assets
