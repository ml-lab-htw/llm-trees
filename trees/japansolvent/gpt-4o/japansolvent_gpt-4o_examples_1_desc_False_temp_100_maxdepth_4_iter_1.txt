Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 that uses the Features provided and predicts whether a company is solvent (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05  # Node 0: Check if EBIT/TA is greater than 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.03    # Node 1: Check if NI/TC is greater than 0.03
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.1     # Node 2: Check if WC/TA is greater than 0.1
    nodes[3] = X["Equity/TL"] > 0.5 # Node 3: Check if Equity/TL is greater than 0.5

    # Tree structure based on the above conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0 (`EBIT/TA > 0.05`)**: If the EBIT to Total Assets ratio is greater than 0.05, it moves down this branch, indicating stronger earnings relative to assets.
2. **Node 1 (`NI/TC > 0.03`)**: If the Net Income to Total Capital ratio is greater than 0.03, it continues down this branch, indicating positive net income relative to capital.
3. **Node 2 (`WC/TA > 0.1`)**: If the Working Capital to Total Assets ratio is greater than 0.1, this indicates that the company has sufficient working capital.
4. **Node 3 (`Equity/TL > 0.5`)**: If the Equity to Total Liabilities ratio is greater than 0.5, it suggests the company is funded more by equity than debt, which is a sign of financial health.

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.06,
    "NI/TC": 0.04,
    "Sales/TA": 0.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.1,
    "NI/Sales": 0.02,
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "Equity/TL": 0.55,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output:
```
Prediction: 1  # Solvent
Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```

In this case, the company is predicted to be solvent based on the given financial ratios.
