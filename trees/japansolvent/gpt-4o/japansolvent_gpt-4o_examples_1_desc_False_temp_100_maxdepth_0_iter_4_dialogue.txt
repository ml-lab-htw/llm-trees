Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree based on the financial ratios you've provided. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the input values for the features and returns both the predicted class (solvent or insolvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each decision node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the decision nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Decision Node 1: Equity / Total Liabilities <= 1.5
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the company has a high level of liabilities relative to equity
        # Decision Node 2: Working Capital / Total Assets <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Low Working Capital -> Insolvent
            prediction = 0
        else:  # Sufficient Working Capital -> Solvent
            prediction = 1

    else:  # If the company has a healthy equity position
        # Decision Node 3: EBIT / Total Assets <= 0.03
        nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03
        
        if nodes[2]:  # Low efficiency in generating profits from assets -> Insolvent
            prediction = 0
        else:  # Healthy EBIT/TA ratio -> Check profitability
            # Decision Node 4: Net Income / Total Capital <= 0.08
            nodes[3] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.08
            
            if nodes[3]:  # Low profitability -> Insolvent
                prediction = 0
            else:  # Good profitability -> Solvent
                prediction = 1

    # Return the final prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Input**: 
  - `X`: This is a dictionary where the keys are the feature names (e.g., `"EBIT/TA"`, `"NI/TC"`, etc.) and the values are the corresponding financial ratios for a company. 
  - Example input: 
    ```python
    X = {
        "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
        "NI/TC": 0.09,
        "Sales/TA": 0.5,
        "EBIT/Sales": 0.2,
        "NI/Sales": 0.15,
        "WC/TA": 0.1,
        "Equity/TL": 2.0,
        "Equity/TA": 0.6
    }
    ```

- **Output**: 
  - The function returns two values:
    1. **`prediction`**: 1 if the company is predicted to be solvent, 0 if predicted to be insolvent.
    2. **`nodes`**: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the internal decision nodes. This helps trace which splits were followed during the decision process.

- **Logic**:
  - **Node 1**: First checks the **Equity / Total Liabilities** ratio. A value less than or equal to 1.5 indicates a higher reliance on liabilities, which increases the risk of insolvency.
  - **Node 2**: If the company has a high debt burden, we next check the **Working Capital / Total Assets** ratio. If this is too low, the company is classified as **Insolvent** (0). Otherwise, it is classified as **Solvent** (1).
  - **Node 3**: If the company has a strong equity base, we move on to the **EBIT / Total Assets** ratio. If this is low, the company is inefficient in generating earnings from its assets, which leads to insolvency.
  - **Node 4**: If the company has a healthy EBIT/TA ratio, we finally check **Net Income / Total Capital**. A low value indicates poor profitability, leading to insolvency.

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "NI/TC": 0.09,
    "Sales/TA": 0.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.2,
    "NI/Sales": 0.15,
    "WC/TA": 0.1,
    "Equity/TL": 2.0,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

For this example, the output might be something like:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [False, None, False, False]
```

This indicates that the company is predicted to be solvent, and the decision process followed the path where `Equity/TL > 1.5` and the other features were evaluated accordingly.
