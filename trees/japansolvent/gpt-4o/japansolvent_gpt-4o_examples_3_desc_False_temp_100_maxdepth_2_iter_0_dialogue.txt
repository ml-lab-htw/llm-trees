Based on your instructions, here is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, using the specified features. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a prediction along with the list of truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.2
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.1
    nodes[2] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent when EBIT/TA > 0.2

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.15,
    'NI/TC': 0.05,
    'Sales/TA': 1.2,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.3,
    'NI/Sales': 0.12,
    'WC/TA': 0.08,
    'Equity/TL': 0.9,
    'Equity/TA': 0.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function:
- The first condition checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.2`.
- If true, it then checks if `NI/TC` is less than or equal to `0.1` to make the final decision.
- If `EBIT/TA` is greater than `0.2`, the company is predicted to be solvent.

Example output:
```python
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True, True, True]
```

In the above example usage:
- The feature `EBIT/TA` is `0.15`, so `nodes[0]` becomes `True`.
- Next, `NI/TC` is `0.05`, so `nodes[1]` becomes `True`.
- Since both conditions in the path are satisfied (`True`), the final prediction indicates that the company is `Not Solvent`.

Feel free to modify the threshold values if you have more precise data or domain knowledge regarding these features.
