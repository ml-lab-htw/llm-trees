Based on the given requirements, we will implement the decision tree classifier function in Python. This function will take a dictionary of feature values as input and return the predicted class (solvent or insolvent) along with a list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions of the tree's nodes were satisfied.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store truth values of tree conditions
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Evaluate conditions for each node in the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.90
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    # Determine the prediction based on evaluated conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # If Equity/Total Liabilities is <= 0.90
        if nodes[1]:  # If EBIT/Total Assets is <= 0.10
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If EBIT/Total Assets is > 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # If Equity/Total Liabilities is > 0.90
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'NI/TC': 0.02,
    'Sales/TA': 0.30,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.10,
    'NI/Sales': -0.01,
    'WC/TA': -0.10,
    'Equity/TL': 0.40,
    'Equity/TA': 0.30
}

# Predict and print the result for the example features
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `nodes` list is initialized with `None` values to store the truth values for each condition in the tree.

2. **Evaluation**:
   - The first condition checks if `Equity/Total Liabilities` is less than or equal to `0.90`.
   - The second condition checks if `EBIT/Total Assets` is less than or equal to `0.10`.

3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the first condition is true:
     - It further checks the second condition to classify as `Insolvent` if true, else `Solvent`.
   - If the first condition is false:
     - It directly classifies as `Solvent`.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns the prediction along with the list of nodes containing the truth values.

This implementation respects the defined tree structure and dynamically evaluates conditions based on input features to make a prediction.
