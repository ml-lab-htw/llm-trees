Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using the most important features (`'EBIT/TA'` and `'NI/TC'`), and includes thresholds that are meaningful based on typical financial ratios.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0) based on financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
        'NI/TC': Net Income/Total Capital
        'Sales/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        'EBIT/Sales': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales
        'NI/Sales': Net Income/Sales
        'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        'Equity/TL': Equity/Total Liabilities
        'Equity/TA': Equity/Total Assets
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if the company is solvent, 0 if insolvent.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # To store the truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # First split: EBIT/TA <= 0.15
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.15
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.15
        # Second split: NI/TC <= 0.10
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.10
        if nodes[1]:  # If NI/TC <= 0.10
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If NI/TC > 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.15
        # Second split: NI/TC <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # If NI/TC <= 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If NI/TC > 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names, and the values are the corresponding feature values for a company.
2. **Nodes**: A list `nodes` is used to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the list corresponds to whether the condition at that node is satisfied (1 for True, 0 for False).
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The first split is based on `'EBIT/TA' <= 0.15`. If this condition is satisfied, the decision proceeds to the second split on `'NI/TC' <= 0.10`. If not, it proceeds to another split on `'NI/TC' <= 0.05`.
   - Based on these splits, the function predicts whether the company is solvent (`1`) or insolvent (`0`).
4. **Output**: The function returns a tuple:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input data
company_data = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.12,
    "NI/TC": 0.08,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.1,
    "NI/Sales": 0.05,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 1.2,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

# Predict whether the company is solvent
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (insolvent) or 1 (solvent)
print("Inner Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True] or similar
```

This function is straightforward to use and provides both the prediction and the internal decision process for interpretability.
