Based on the Features and the new prediction target, here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 for predicting whether a company is solvent or insolvent. I've used logical conditions combining the provided features to create this decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] > 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.1
    nodes[2] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.05
    nodes[3] = X["Sales/TA"] > 0.3
    nodes[4] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.2

    if nodes[0]:  # Equity/TL > 0.5
        if nodes[1]:  # EBIT/TA > 0.1
            if nodes[2]:  # NI/TC > 0.05
                prediction = 1  # solvent
            else:  # NI/TC <= 0.05
                if nodes[3]:  # Sales/TA > 0.3
                    prediction = 1  # solvent
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # insolvent
        else:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.1
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
    else:  # Equity/TL <= 0.5
        if nodes[4]:  # WC/TA > 0.2
            prediction = 1  # solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # insolvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): The first condition checks whether the ratio of Equity to Total Liabilities (`Equity/TL`) is greater than 0.5. If yes, the company is likely solvent (more equity compared to liabilities). If not, the company might be at risk of insolvency.
   
2. **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): If the company passes the equity/liability test, I next check if the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes to Total Assets (`EBIT/TA`) is greater than 0.1. Positive EBIT relative to assets is a sign of good operational efficiency.

3. **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): The third level checks if the Net Income to Total Capital (`NI/TC`) is greater than 0.05. A healthy net income relative to the total capital indicates profitability.

4. **Node 3** (`nodes[3]`): For companies with lower profitability, I check if the company has a good sales/asset ratio (`Sales/TA`). A ratio greater than 0.3 is typically a good indicator of solvency.

5. **Node 4** (`nodes[4]`): If the equity/liability ratio is low, I check the working capital relative to total assets (`WC/TA`). A working capital ratio greater than 0.2 might still indicate that the company can meet its short-term obligations, leading to a prediction of solvency.

### Summary:
- This decision tree uses 5 nodes to predict company solvency based on financial ratios, making a prediction of either 1 (solvent) or 0 (insolvent) based on the conditions.
- The nodes list will contain the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions for each inner node, allowing you to trace the decision-making process.
