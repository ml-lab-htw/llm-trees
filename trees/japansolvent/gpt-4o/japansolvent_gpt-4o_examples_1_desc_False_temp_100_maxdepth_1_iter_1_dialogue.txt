Here's how your decision tree classifier can be implemented as a Python function for determining the solvency of a company:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0) based on financial ratios.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary of feature values with the following keys:
        'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
        'NI/TC': Net Income / Total Capital
        'Sales/TA': Sales / Total Assets
        'EBIT/Sales': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
        'NI/Sales': Net Income / Sales
        'WC/TA': Working Capital / Total Assets
        'Equity/TL': Equity / Total Liabilities
        'Equity/TA': Equity / Total Assets

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 (solvent) or 0 (insolvent)
        - nodes (list): Truth values (0 or 1) of the inner nodes of the decision tree
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Inner node rule: Check Equity/TL
    # Threshold is set to 1.5 based on the assumption that if Equity/TL is less than or equal to 1.5, the company is more likely to be insolvent.
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.5
    
    # Make prediction based on the rule
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not solvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Selection**:
   - This decision tree splits data based on `"Equity/TL"` (Equity/Total Liabilities), which is assumed to be the most important feature for determining solvency.
   
2. **Threshold**:
   - A threshold of `1.5` is chosen. If `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to `1.5`, the company is classified as **insolvent** (`0`). Otherwise, it is classified as **solvent** (`1`).

3. **Depth Limitation**:
   - The tree has a maximum depth of 1, meaning it only contains a single decision node.

4. **Inner Node Evaluation**:
   - The `nodes` list contains the evaluation of the inner node. For this depth-1 tree, it contains a single truth value (0 or 1), indicating whether the condition `Equity/TL <= 1.5` is satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example company financials
example_data = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.08,
    "NI/TC": 0.10,
    "Sales/TA": 0.9,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.12,
    "NI/Sales": 0.06,
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "Equity/TL": 1.2,
    "Equity/TA": 0.5
}

# Get prediction and inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(example_data)

# Output
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent)")
print(f"Inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Expected Output:
For the example input above:
```plaintext
Prediction: 0 (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent)
Inner nodes: [True]
```

This output means the company is predicted to be insolvent (`0`) because its `"Equity/TL"` is `1.2`, which is less than or equal to the threshold of `1.5`.
