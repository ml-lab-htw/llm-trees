Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 based on the Features you provided. I have chosen the most important feature from the list (in this context, I will assume that the feature "EBIT/TA" is the most important for determining whether a company is solvent or insolvent).

### Decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05  # Example threshold for EBIT/TA

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # solvent if EBIT/TA > 0.05
    else:
        prediction = 0  # insolvent if EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree has one inner node that checks whether the feature `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.05.
  - If `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.05, the prediction is `1` (solvent).
  - Otherwise, the prediction is `0` (insolvent).
- The `nodes` list contains a single boolean value representing whether the condition (`EBIT/TA > 0.05`) is satisfied or not. If the condition is satisfied, the corresponding entry in `nodes` is `1` (True), otherwise, it's `0` (False).

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {"EBIT/TA": 0.08, "NI/TC": 0.12, "Sales/TA": 0.65, "EBIT/Sales": 0.20, "NI/Sales": 0.10, "WC/TA": 0.15, "Equity/TL": 1.2, "Equity/TA": 0.8}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example:
- Since `EBIT/TA = 0.08` is greater than 0.05, the prediction will be `1` (solvent), and `nodes = [1]`.
