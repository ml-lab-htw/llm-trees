Based on the Features and target variable, I can generate a decision tree of depth 3 that evaluates the solvency of a company. The decision tree will use the most important features, but keep in mind that since we are not training this on actual data, the splits are hypothetical and based on reasonable logic.

Here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.05 (arbitrary threshold indicating low profitability relative to assets)
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: WC/TA <= 0.1 (arbitrary threshold indicating low working capital relative to assets)
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: NI/TC <= 0.03 (arbitrary threshold indicating low net income relative to total capital)
            nodes[2] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.03
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Company is likely insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Company is likely solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Company is likely solvent
    else:
        # Node 4: Equity/TL <= 0.5 (arbitrary threshold indicating low equity relative to liabilities)
        nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.5
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Company is likely insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Company is likely solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 1**: The first decision is based on "EBIT/TA" (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets). If EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.05, this might indicate low profitability relative to the company's assets, which could signal financial difficulties. If this condition is true, we proceed down the left branch; otherwise, we go down the right branch.

2. **Node 2 (left branch)**: If EBIT/TA is low (≤ 0.05), we then check "WC/TA" (Working Capital / Total Assets). A low working capital relative to assets (≤ 0.1) could mean the company is struggling with liquidity, which is often a sign of financial distress.

3. **Node 3 (left-left branch)**: If both EBIT/TA and WC/TA are low, we next look at "NI/TC" (Net Income / Total Capital). If NI/TC is also low (≤ 0.03), this further suggests that the company is generating very little income relative to its capital, making it more likely to be insolvent (prediction = 0). If NI/TC is higher, the company may still be solvent (prediction = 1).

4. **Node 4 (right branch)**: If EBIT/TA is greater than 0.05, we check "Equity/TL" (Equity / Total Liabilities). A low Equity/TL ratio (≤ 0.5) indicates that the company has relatively high liabilities compared to its equity, which could signal insolvency. If this condition holds, we predict insolvency (prediction = 0); otherwise, the company is solvent (prediction = 1).

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "NI/TC": 0.02,
    "Sales/TA": 0.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.1,
    "NI/Sales": 0.05,
    "WC/TA": 0.05,
    "Equity/TL": 0.4,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Node values: {nodes}")      # Output: Node values: [True, True, True]
```

In this example, the company's EBIT/TA is low (≤ 0.05), WC/TA is low (≤ 0.1), and NI/TC is also low (≤ 0.03), leading to a prediction of insolvency. The list `nodes = [True, True, True]` indicates that all three conditions in the decision tree were satisfied.
