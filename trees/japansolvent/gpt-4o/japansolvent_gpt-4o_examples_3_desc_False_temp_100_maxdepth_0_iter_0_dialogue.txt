Below is the `predict` function for the decision tree we discussed. This function uses the specified financial metrics to classify whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0). The function returns both the classification prediction and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.0
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05    
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.15  
    nodes[3] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08 
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Equity/TL <= 1.0:** The first node checks if the ratio of Equity to Total Liabilities is less than or equal to 1.0. This evaluates the company's leverage.
2. **NI/TC <= 0.05:** If the first condition is met, the second node checks if the Net Income to Total Capital ratio is less than or equal to 0.05. This evaluates profitability.
3. **Equity/TA <= 0.15:** If the second condition is not met, the third node checks if the ratio of Equity to Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.15. This evaluates the company's equity base.
4. **EBIT/TA <= 0.08:** If the first condition is not met, the fourth node checks if the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes to Total Assets ratio is less than or equal to 0.08. This evaluates operational efficiency.

The function will return the prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. This way, you can trace which paths were taken within the decision tree.
