Based on the Features provided, I will induce a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, using the most important features. Since we are not training the tree on actual data, I will choose a feature that is often considered important in financial health assessments of companies, such as "EBIT/TA" (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets). Typically, a higher EBIT/TA ratio indicates better profitability, which is a good predictor of solvency.

Here is the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Decision based on EBIT/TA
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05  # Assume 0.05 as a threshold for solvency
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree has one inner node, which checks if the "EBIT/TA" ratio is greater than 0.05.
- If the "EBIT/TA" is greater than 0.05, the company is predicted to be **solvent** (`prediction = 1`).
- Otherwise, the company is predicted to be **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
- The list `nodes` will store the truth value (`True` or `False`) for the condition of the inner node.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.06,
    "NI/TC": 0.03,
    "Sales/TA": 0.8,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.1,
    "NI/Sales": 0.2,
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "Equity/TL": 1.2,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, since `EBIT/TA = 0.06`, which is greater than 0.05, the company is predicted to be solvent (`prediction = 1`), and the inner node condition is satisfied (`nodes = [True]`).
