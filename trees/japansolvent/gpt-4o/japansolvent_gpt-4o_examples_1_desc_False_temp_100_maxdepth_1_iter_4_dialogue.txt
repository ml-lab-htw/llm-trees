Here is the corresponding Python function for your required decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0) 
    based on financial features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following features:
        'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
        'NI/TC': Net Income/Total Capital
        'Sales/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        'EBIT/Sales': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales
        'NI/Sales': Net Income/Sales
        'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        'Equity/TL': Equity/Total Liabilities
        'Equity/TA': Equity/Total Assets
    
    Returns:
    int: The predicted class (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent).
    list: A boolean list of truth values for the decision tree's inner nodes.
    """
    
    # Initializing the list to track the truth values of each condition
    nodes = [None]  # Depth 1 decision tree has one condition

    # Condition for the root node: 'NI/TC' <= 0.15
    nodes[0] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.15

    # Decision based on the condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation
1. **Inputs**: The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial features provided:
   - `'EBIT/TA'`
   - `'NI/TC'`
   - `'Sales/TA'`
   - `'EBIT/Sales'`
   - `'NI/Sales'`
   - `'WC/TA'`
   - `'Equity/TL'`
   - `'Equity/TA'`

2. **Condition**:
   - Based on the tree, the critical feature is `'NI/TC'` (Net Income/Total Capital).
   - The threshold value is `0.15`. If `NI/TC` is less than or equal to `0.15`, classify the company as **insolvent (0)**, otherwise **solvent (1)**.

3. **Truth values**:
   - The list `nodes` keeps track of whether the condition of the decision node is satisfied (`1` or `True`) or not (`0` or `False`).

4. **Return values**:
   - The function returns the classification (`prediction`) along with the `nodes` list that tracks the evaluation of inner nodes.

### Example Use Case

```python
# Example input
example_input = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.12,
    "NI/TC": 0.10,  # Key feature
    "Sales/TA": 1.2,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.35,
    "NI/Sales": 0.08,
    "WC/TA": 0.20,
    "Equity/TL": 0.90,
    "Equity/TA": 0.55
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (insolvent)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True]
```

### For Depth 1 Decision Tree:
- This function uses only one condition (`NI/TC <= 0.15`) to classify the company as either solvent (`1`) or insolvent (`0`).
- If you would like to extend this tree to greater depths, the function can be updated with additional conditions or nested if-else structures.
