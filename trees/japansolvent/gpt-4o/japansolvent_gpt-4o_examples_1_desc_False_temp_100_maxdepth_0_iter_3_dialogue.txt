Sure! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier, formatted as you requested. The function returns both a prediction (solvent or insolvent) and a list of boolean values representing whether each condition at the inner nodes is satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # We have 5 internal nodes in this tree

    # Node 0: Check if Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL) <= 0.50
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.50
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC) <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= -0.10
            nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    else:
        # Node 3: Check if Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.10
        nodes[3] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Check if Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales (EBIT/Sales) <= 0.05
            nodes[4] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <= 0.05
            
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores whether each condition (at each internal node) is satisfied (`True` or `False`). The length of the list is pre-defined based on the number of internal nodes in the tree.
- **Conditions**: The tree's decisions are based on thresholds that make sense based on typical financial ratios, with values like 0.50 for **Equity/Total Liabilities (E/TL)**, 0.05 for **Net Income/Total Capital (NI/TC)**, and so on.
- **Prediction**: The function returns `1` if the company is solvent, and `0` if the company is insolvent.

### Example usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary with financial data
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.12, 
    "NI/TC": 0.06, 
    "Sales/TA": 0.4, 
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.08, 
    "NI/Sales": 0.07, 
    "WC/TA": 0.05, 
    "Equity/TL": 0.55, 
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This `predict()` function will classify the given company as solvent or insolvent based on the financial ratios and return the decision path taken.
