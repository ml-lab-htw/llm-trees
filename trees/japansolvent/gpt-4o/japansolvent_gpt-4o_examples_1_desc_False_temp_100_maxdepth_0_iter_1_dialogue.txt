Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on the provided financial features. The function follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Equity/TL <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: WC/TA <= -0.1
            nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.1
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        # Node 3: NI/Sales <= 0.03
        nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] <= 0.03
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: EBIT/Sales <= 0.1
            nodes[4] = X["EBIT/Sales"] <= 0.1
            
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (as provided) and the values are the respective feature values.
   - Example: `X = {"EBIT/TA": 0.06, "NI/TC": 0.02, "Sales/TA": 0.5, ...}`

2. **Output**: The function returns two items:
   - `prediction`: A binary value that indicates whether the company is solvent (`1`) or insolvent (`0`).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values where each entry corresponds to whether an inner node condition was satisfied (`1` if the condition is true, `0` otherwise).
   
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The decision tree checks conditions at each node:
     - First, it checks if `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to 1.0.
     - Depending on that, it further checks `EBIT/TA`, `WC/TA`, `NI/Sales`, and `EBIT/Sales` to make the final prediction.
   - The thresholds were selected based on reasonable financial interpretations, such as:
     - **Equity/TL <= 1.0**: A company with liabilities exceeding or equal to equity could be at risk.
     - **EBIT/TA <= 0.05**: Low profitability relative to assets might indicate financial trouble.
     - **WC/TA <= -0.1**: Negative working capital is a sign of liquidity issues.
     - **NI/Sales <= 0.03**: Low net income relative to sales could signal weak profitability.
     - **EBIT/Sales <= 0.1**: A low EBIT margin suggests inefficiency in generating profits from sales.

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "NI/TC": 0.02,
    "Sales/TA": 0.6,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.08,
    "NI/Sales": 0.02,
    "WC/TA": -0.05,
    "Equity/TL": 0.8,
    "Equity/TA": 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example:
- The company would be classified as **solvent** (`prediction = 1`), and the list of truth values for the decision tree nodes would show which conditions were satisfied along the decision path.
