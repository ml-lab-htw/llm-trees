Based on the Features and target variable that you provided, let's create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4. The decision tree will attempt to classify whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on some of the given financial ratios.

Here is the decision tree in Python format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.08
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08
    
    # Node 2: NI/TC > 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.05
    
    # Node 3: Sales/TA <= 1.2
    nodes[2] = X["Sales/TA"] <= 1.2
    
    # Node 4: Equity/TL > 0.5
    nodes[3] = X["Equity/TL"] > 0.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
1. **Node 1:** Checks whether `EBIT/TA <= 0.08`. If true, it moves to the next condition.
2. **Node 2:** Checks whether `NI/TC > 0.05`. This is the net income relative to total capital. A higher `NI/TC` indicates a healthier company.
3. **Node 3:** Evaluates `Sales/TA <= 1.2`. This measures how efficiently the company uses its assets to generate sales.
4. **Node 4:** Finally, it checks whether `Equity/TL > 0.5`. A higher equity-to-liabilities ratio indicates less leverage and a more solvent company.

The tree has a maximum depth of 4 and makes a prediction based on the conditions at each node. The function returns the prediction (1 for solvent and 0 for insolvent) along with a list of the truth values of each node.
