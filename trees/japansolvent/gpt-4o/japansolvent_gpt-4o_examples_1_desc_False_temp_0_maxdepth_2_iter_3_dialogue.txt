Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a single prediction (`1` for solvent, `0` for insolvent) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0) based on financial ratios.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
        - 'NI/TC': Net Income/Total Capital
        - 'Sales/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/Sales': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales
        - 'NI/Sales': Net Income/Sales
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'Equity/TL': Equity/Total Liabilities
        - 'Equity/TA': Equity/Total Assets

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if the company is solvent, 0 if insolvent
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    # Initialize the list of nodes (inner conditions)
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.10
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    # Node 1: NI/TC <= 0.05 (only evaluated if Node 0 is False)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated if Node 0 is True
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.10
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.10
        if nodes[1]:  # If NI/TC <= 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If NI/TC > 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.12,
    "NI/TC": 0.04,
    "Sales/TA": 0.8,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.15,
    "NI/Sales": 0.1,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 1.5,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Insolvent) or 1 (Solvent)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True] or similar based on input
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Node 0** checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.10`. If this condition is satisfied, the company is classified as **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`), and no further nodes are evaluated.
2. If **Node 0** is not satisfied (`EBIT/TA > 0.10`), **Node 1** is evaluated. **Node 1** checks if `NI/TC` is less than or equal to `0.05`. If this condition is satisfied, the company is classified as **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
3. If neither condition is satisfied, the company is classified as **solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
- `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `EBIT/TA <= 0.10`.
- `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `NI/TC <= 0.05` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`).

This implementation adheres to the structure of a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.
