Sure, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree classifier guided by the given features. Let's use the thresholds and structure as previously described:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.02
    nodes[2] = X["Sales/TA"] <= 0.60
    nodes[3] = X["NI/Sales"] <= 0.03

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            # EBIT/TA <= 0.05 and NI/TC <= 0.02
            prediction = 0  # Non-Solvent
        else:
            # EBIT/TA <= 0.05 and NI/TC > 0.02
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                # EBIT/TA > 0.05 and Sales/TA <= 0.60 and NI/Sales <= 0.03
                prediction = 0  # Non-Solvent
            else:
                # EBIT/TA > 0.05 and Sales/TA <= 0.60 and NI/Sales > 0.03
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            # EBIT/TA > 0.05 and Sales/TA > 0.60
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.06,
    "NI/TC": 0.03,
    "Sales/TA": 0.70,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.10,
    "NI/Sales": 0.04,
    "WC/TA": 0.08,
    "Equity/TL": 1.5,
    "Equity/TA": 0.75
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Solvent'}")
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection & Thresholds:**
   - **EBIT/TA:** Companies must have their `EBIT/TA` evaluated against `0.05`. This is the first node (nodes[0]).
   - **NI/TC:** If `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.05`, then evaluate `NI/TC` against `0.02` (nodes[1]).
   - **Sales/TA:** If `EBIT/TA` is greater than `0.05`, then evaluate `Sales/TA` against `0.60` (nodes[2]).
   - **NI/Sales:** Further evaluate `NI/Sales` only if the `Sales/TA` condition applies (nodes[3]).

2. **Nodes Array:** Includes Boolean values (True/False) for each decision node condition, providing a path tracing mechanism through the tree.

3. **Prediction Logic:** Follows the condition specified:
   - If `EBIT/TA <= 0.05` and `NI/TC <= 0.02`, classify as `Non-Solvent`.
   - If `EBIT/TA <= 0.05` and `NI/TC > 0.02`, classify as `Solvent`.
   - If `EBIT/TA > 0.05`:
     - If `Sales/TA <= 0.60` and `NI/Sales <= 0.03`, classify as `Non-Solvent`.
     - If `Sales/TA <= 0.60` and `NI/Sales > 0.03` or `Sales/TA > 0.60`, classify as `Solvent`.

**Note:** Adjust the thresholds and feature importance based on your actual dataset for precise classification.
