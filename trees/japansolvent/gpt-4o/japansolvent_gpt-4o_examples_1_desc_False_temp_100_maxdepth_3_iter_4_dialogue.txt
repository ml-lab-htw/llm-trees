Hereâ€™s the Python function for the decision tree classifier that predicts if a company is solvent or insolvent, based on the provided features and thresholds. The function will return the prediction as well as a list (`nodes`) representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0) based on financial ratios.
    
    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the financial feature values for a company.
              Keys: 'EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales', 'NI/Sales', 'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA'
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple of:
           - prediction (int): 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent
           - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    # Decision tree logic
    # Node 0: Equity/TL <= 0.50
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.50
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Equity/TL <= 0.50
        # Node 1: NI/TC <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:  # NI/TC <= 0.05
            # Node 2: WC/TA <= -0.10
            nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
            
            if nodes[2]:  # WC/TA <= -0.10
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:  # WC/TA > -0.10
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # NI/TC > 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # Equity/TL > 0.50
        # Node 3: EBIT/TA <= 0.10
        nodes[3] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
        
        if nodes[3]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.10
            # Node 4: NI/Sales <= 0.02
            nodes[4] = X["NI/Sales"] <= 0.02
            
            if nodes[4]:  # NI/Sales <= 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:  # NI/Sales > 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### How This Function Works:
1. **Inner Nodes (Conditions):**
   - Each node represents a condition based on one of the financial ratios. The truth value (`1` or `0`) of each condition is calculated and stored in the `nodes` list.
   - `nodes` keeps track of decisions at each node, with `1` indicating the condition was satisfied (True) and `0` indicating it was not satisfied (False).

2. **Thresholds:** 
   - **Node 0:** Checks if `Equity/TL` (a primary solvency indicator) is less than or equal to 0.50.
   - **Node 1:** If the company is at higher risk due to low equity, `NI/TC` is checked to see if profitability is too low (<= 0.05).
   - **Node 2:** If profitability is also low, the `WC/TA` ratio is checked to see if working capital is negative (<= -0.10), sealing insolvency.
   - **Node 3:** For companies with good financial structure (`Equity/TL > 0.50`), efficiency is checked via `EBIT/TA` to see if it's too low (<= 0.10).
   - **Node 4:** If efficiency seems poor, profitability at the sales level is checked via `NI/Sales` (<= 0.02).

3. **Prediction:**
   - The final classification (solvent or insolvent) is determined based on the path taken through the decision tree.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Sample input: Financial ratios of a company
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.15,
    "NI/TC": 0.04,
    "Sales/TA": 0.8,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.12,
    "NI/Sales": 0.01,
    "WC/TA": -0.05,
    "Equity/TL": 0.45,
    "Equity/TA": 0.6
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}")
```

#### Output for the above example:
```
Prediction: Insolvent
Nodes (Truth Values): [1, 1, 0, None, None]
```

The function correctly classifies the company and provides the truth table for the inner nodes.
