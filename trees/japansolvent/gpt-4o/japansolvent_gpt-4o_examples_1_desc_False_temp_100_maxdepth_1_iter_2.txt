Based on the new set of features and the target variable indicating whether a company is solvent, I will create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1. The most critical financial ratios typically used to assess a company's solvency include leverage and profitability metrics. Here, I will assume that the feature `Equity/TA` (Equity/Total Assets) is the most important for determining whether a company is solvent, as it represents the proportion of a company's assets financed by equity, which is a fundamental measure of financial health.

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Create a list to represent the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 0: Check if Equity/TA (Equity/Total Assets) is greater than 0.5
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.5
    
    # If the node condition is true, predict 1 (solvent), else predict 0 (insolvent)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # solvent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # insolvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree checks if the company's `Equity/TA` (Equity divided by Total Assets) is greater than 0.5.
  - If `Equity/TA` is greater than 0.5, the company is predicted to be solvent (prediction = 1).
  - Otherwise, the company is predicted to be insolvent (prediction = 0).
- The list `nodes` contains a single boolean value, which indicates whether the condition `Equity/TA > 0.5` is satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).

This simple decision tree provides a basic solvency prediction based on the company's equity-to-assets ratio.
