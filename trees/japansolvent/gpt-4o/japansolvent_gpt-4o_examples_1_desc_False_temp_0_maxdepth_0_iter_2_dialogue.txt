Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a single prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0) based on financial ratios.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
        - 'Equity/TL': Equity/Total Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if solvent, 0 if insolvent
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.50

    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # Equity/TL <= 1.50
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # Equity/TL > 1.50
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (`'EBIT/TA'` and `'Equity/TL'`) and the values are the corresponding feature values for a company.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if `'EBIT/TA'` is less than or equal to 0.05.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if `'Equity/TL'` is less than or equal to 1.50.
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., `'EBIT/TA'` <= 0.05), the company is classified as **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (i.e., `'EBIT/TA'` > 0.05), the function evaluates `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True` (i.e., `'Equity/TL'` <= 1.50), the company is classified as **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If `nodes[1]` is `False` (i.e., `'Equity/TL'` > 1.50), the company is classified as **solvent** (`prediction = 1`).
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The classification result (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.06,
    "Equity/TL": 1.60
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Solvent)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
```

This function is simple, interpretable, and adheres to the decision tree structure with a maximum depth of 2.
