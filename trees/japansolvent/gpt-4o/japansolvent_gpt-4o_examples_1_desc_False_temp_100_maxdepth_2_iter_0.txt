Here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for the Features you provided. The decision tree uses the most important features to predict whether a company is solvent or insolvent.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets)
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.10
    
    # Second decision node: NI/TC (Net Income / Total Capital)
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # insolvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is made based on the `EBIT/TA` ratio, which is a profitability metric. If `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.10, the company is considered more likely solvent.
2. **Node 1**: The second decision is based on `NI/TC`, a profitability and efficiency ratio. If `NI/TC` is greater than 0.05, the company is likely solvent. Otherwise, it is likely insolvent.

This tree is constructed with a maximum depth of 2 and contains 2 internal (decision) nodes. The `nodes` list represents the conditions at each decision node:
- `nodes[0]` checks whether `EBIT/TA > 0.10`.
- `nodes[1]` checks whether `NI/TC > 0.05`.

The function returns the predicted class (solvent or insolvent) and the list of truth values (`nodes`) for the conditions at each decision node.
