Here is a Python function based on the decision tree we discussed earlier, now formatted to provide a single prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.60
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.15

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # X['NI/TC'] > 0.05
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:  # X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # X['Equity/TL'] > 0.60
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # X['WC/TA'] > 0.15
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'NI/TC': 0.06,
    'Sales/TA': 0.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.2,
    'NI/Sales': 0.1,
    'WC/TA': 0.16,
    'Equity/TL': 0.7,
    'Equity/TA': 0.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation
This function implements the decision tree as described previously. It checks the conditions at each of the decision nodes and sets them in the `nodes` list as either `True` (1) or `False` (0).

#### Nodes List Structure:
1. `nodes[0]`: Whether `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to 0.60
2. `nodes[1]`: Whether `NI/TC` is less than or equal to 0.05 (checked only if `nodes[0]` is True)
3. `nodes[2]`: Whether `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.02 (checked only if `nodes[0]` is True and `nodes[1]` is False)
4. `nodes[3]`: Whether `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.15 (checked only if `nodes[0]` is False)

Then it traverses the tree and makes a prediction of whether the company is solvent (`1`) or insolvent (`0`).

#### Example Usage:
The example usage shows how to call the function with a dictionary `X` containing the features and how to interpret the output. The prediction is printed as "Solvent" or "Insolvent" based on the return value, and the nodes list shows the truth values of each inner node condition.
