### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a condition in the decision tree. These are assigned boolean values based on comparisons of the input features (`X`) with threshold values.
- **First split** (`nodes[0]`): The first condition checks whether the company has high or low leverage (measured by "Equity/TL"). High leverage (low equity relative to liabilities) is a risk factor for insolvency.
- **Second split** (`nodes[1]`): For highly leveraged companies, the next check is liquidity ("WC/TA"). Low liquidity is another indicator of potential insolvency.
- **Third split** (`nodes[2]`): If liquidity is sufficient, we check profitability ("EBIT/TA"). Low profitability is a sign of financial distress.
- **Fourth split** (`nodes[3]`): For companies with low leverage, profitability is an important indicator of solvency.
- **Fifth split** (`nodes[4]`): For low-profitability companies, we further check the net profit margin ("NI/Sales"). A low margin may indicate insolvency.

The function returns the **prediction** (whether the company is solvent or insolvent) and a list of the **truth values** of the inner nodes (whether each condition was satisfied).
