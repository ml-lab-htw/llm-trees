Sure! Below is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 based on the Features you provided, and the target variable is whether a company is solvent (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent). I'll create the tree using the most important features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.1
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if NI/TC is less than or equal to 0.02
        nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.02
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if WC/TA is less than or equal to 0.05
            nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        # Node 2: Check if Equity/TL is greater than 0.5
        nodes[2] = X["Equity/TL"] > 0.5
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Decision Tree Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the ratio `EBIT/TA`. If this ratio is less than or equal to 0.1, the company is generally less profitable relative to its assets, which could indicate insolvency.
   
2. **Node 1**: If the company passes the first test (i.e., `EBIT/TA` is low), it checks the `NI/TC` (Net Income/Total Capital) ratio. A low `NI/TC` ratio (less than or equal to 0.02) suggests the company may have poor profitability, increasing the likelihood of insolvency.

3. **Node 2**: If both EBIT/TA and NI/TC are low, the tree checks the `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) ratio. A low value (less than or equal to 0.05) indicates low liquidity, which further confirms insolvency. If WC/TA is higher, the company has more liquidity and thus is solvent.

4. If the `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.1, the decision moves to the third node, which checks `Equity/TL` (Equity/Total Liabilities). A higher ratio (greater than 0.5) indicates the company has strong equity relative to its liabilities, suggesting solvency.

This is a basic decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 that uses 3 inner nodes for decision-making.
