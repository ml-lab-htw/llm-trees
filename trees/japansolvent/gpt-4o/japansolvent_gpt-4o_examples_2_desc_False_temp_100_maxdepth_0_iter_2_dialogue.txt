Sure! Based on your requirements, let's construct a decision tree classifier in Python for predicting whether a company is solvent or not using the given features. The tree will return a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's a sample implementation that considers meaningful thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to track the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 4

    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.1
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] > 0.5
    nodes[2] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.05
    nodes[3] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.2

    # Determine the prediction based on the node conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.15,
    "NI/TC": 0.08,
    "Sales/TA": 0.45,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.2,
    "NI/Sales": 0.06,
    "WC/TA": 0.3,
    "Equity/TL": 0.6,
    "Equity/TA": 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Node Conditions**:
   - The `nodes` list is initialized with `None` to keep track of the conditions at each decision point.
   - The thresholds for the conditions are chosen for demonstration purposes (e.g., `EBIT/TA > 0.1`).

2. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - Each condition narrows down the decision path. For instance, if `nodes[0]` is satisfied (`EBIT/TA > 0.1`), the next condition is evaluated.
   - Based on the satisfaction of the node conditions, the decision tree leads to a classification as solvent (`1`) or insolvent (`0`).

3. **Example Usage**:
   - The example feature vector `X` is used to test the prediction function.
   - The output includes the prediction, and the list of node conditions evaluated to `True` or `False`.

You can fine-tune the thresholds to better fit your data or business logic.
