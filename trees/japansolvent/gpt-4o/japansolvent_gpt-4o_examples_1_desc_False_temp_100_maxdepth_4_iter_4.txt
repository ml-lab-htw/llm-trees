Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 based on the Features and the target variable, "company is solvent (1 = solvent, 0 = insolvent)". This tree is created using logic and without training on actual data. The decision tree is represented as a Python function that returns a prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    # Node 1: Equity/TA <= 0.3
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.3
    
    # Node 2: NI/TC <= 0.02
    nodes[2] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.02
    
    # Node 3: WC/TA > 0.15
    nodes[3] = X["WC/TA"] > 0.15
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:

1. **Node 0 (EBIT/TA ≤ 0.05)**: The tree first checks if the ratio of EBIT to Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.05. Companies with a low EBIT/TA ratio may be more likely to be insolvent.
   
2. **Node 1 (Equity/TA ≤ 0.3)**: If EBIT/TA is low, the next check is whether the Equity to Total Assets ratio is less than or equal to 0.3. Companies with low equity as a portion of total assets may be more at risk of insolvency.
   
3. **Node 2 (NI/TC ≤ 0.02)**: If both EBIT/TA and Equity/TA are low, the tree checks if the Net Income to Total Capital ratio is less than or equal to 0.02. Low net income relative to total capital could indicate financial instability.
   
4. **Node 3 (WC/TA > 0.15)**: Finally, the tree checks if Working Capital to Total Assets is greater than 0.15. Higher working capital relative to total assets can be a sign of better liquidity, which would indicate a solvent company.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input features
features = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "NI/TC": 0.01,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.1,
    "NI/Sales": 0.05,
    "WC/TA": 0.18,
    "Equity/TL": 0.4,
    "Equity/TA": 0.25
}

# Predict whether the company is solvent or insolvent
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Inner node values:", nodes)
```

This code will output whether the company is solvent or insolvent based on the input features and will also return the evaluation of the inner nodes as a boolean list.
