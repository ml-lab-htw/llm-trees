The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features with the exact keys as specified, and returns a single prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for not solvent), along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the list `nodes` is `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to hold truth values for 2 inner nodes

    # Inner Node 0: Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.0
    nodes[0] = int(X['NI/TC'] <= 0.0)

    # Inner Node 1: Equity/Total Liabilities <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.5)

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied, predict Not Solvent (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 0 condition is not satisfied but Node 1 condition is, predict Not Solvent (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If neither Node 0 nor Node 1 conditions are satisfied, predict Solvent (1)
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node Assignments:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `NI/TC <= 0.0`.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `Equity/TL <= 0.5`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition is satisfied), the company is predicted to be **Not Solvent** (`0`).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (condition is not satisfied), we check `nodes[1]`.
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1`, the company is predicted to be **Not Solvent** (`0`).
    - If `nodes[1]` is `0`, the company is predicted to be **Solvent** (`1`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a company with the following financial ratios:

```python
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.15,
    'NI/TC': 0.05,
    'Sales/TA': 1.2,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.1,
    'NI/Sales': 0.04,
    'WC/TA': 0.2,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.5
}
```

We can predict the solvency of the company using the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Solvent'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Solvent
Nodes: [0, 0]
```

This means that the company is predicted to be solvent, and neither of the inner node conditions were satisfied (`nodes` entries are `0`).
