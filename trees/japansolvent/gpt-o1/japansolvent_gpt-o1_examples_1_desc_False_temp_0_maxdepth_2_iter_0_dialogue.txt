    """
    Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of financial ratios.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent)
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.05  # ROA threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TL"] > 1.0  # Equity/Liabilities threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent (likely)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent (potential risk - high leverage)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent (likely - low profitability)

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  The code now explicitly uses `0.05` for `NI/TC` (ROA) and `1.0` for `Equity/TL` as threshold values, making the logic more transparent.  These are still illustrative examples; real-world thresholds would be learned from data.
* **Consistent Node Logic:** The conditions in the `if` statements are consistent with the decision tree logic described earlier.
* **Docstring:**  A docstring is added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
* **Type Hinting:** Type hinting (`X: dict`) improves code readability and helps with static analysis.


**Example Usage:**

```python
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.10,
    'NI/TC': 0.08,
    'Sales/TA': 1.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.067,
    'NI/Sales': 0.053,
    'WC/TA': 0.2,
    'Equity/TL': 0.8,  # Liabilities exceed equity
    'Equity/TA': 0.45
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Insolvent)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, False] (ROA > 0.05, Equity/TL <= 1.0)


company_data2 = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.12,
    'NI/TC': 0.09,
    'Sales/TA': 1.7,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.071,
    'NI/Sales': 0.059,
    'WC/TA': 0.25,
    'Equity/TL': 1.2,
    'Equity/TA': 0.55
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(company_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (Solvent)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True] (ROA > 0.05, Equity/TL > 1.0)
```


This revised answer provides a complete, functional Python implementation that addresses the prompt's requirements while maintaining clarity and best practices. It also demonstrates how to use the function with example data and interpret the output. Remember that the accuracy of this model relies heavily on the quality and representativeness of the training data used to determine the appropriate thresholds.
