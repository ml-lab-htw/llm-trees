Based on the decision tree provided earlier and following the format of your examples, here is the Python function that predicts whether a company is **solvent** (1) or **not solvent** (0). The function returns the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, where each entry is **1** if the condition is satisfied and **0** otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = int(X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30)
    nodes[1] = int(X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05)

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # Equity/TA <= 0.30
        prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
    else:
        # Equity/TA > 0.30
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
        else:
            # EBIT/TA > 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Equity/TA"`: Equity divided by Total Assets.
  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `Equity/TA <= 0.30`.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `Equity/TA` is **less than or equal to** 0.30 (`nodes[0] == 1`), the company is classified as **Not Solvent** (`prediction = 0`).
  - Else, if `Equity/TA` is **greater than** 0.30 (`nodes[0] == 0`):
    - If `EBIT/TA` is **less than or equal to** 0.05 (`nodes[1] == 1`), the company is classified as **Not Solvent** (`prediction = 0`).
    - Else, if `EBIT/TA` is **greater than** 0.05 (`nodes[1] == 0`), the company is classified as **Solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

Let's test the function with an example:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.07,
    "NI/TC": 0.05,
    "Sales/TA": 0.8,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.09,
    "NI/Sales": 0.06,
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "Equity/TL": 0.5,
    "Equity/TA": 0.35
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Step 1:** Evaluate `nodes[0]`:
  - `nodes[0] = int(X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.30)`
  - `nodes[0] = int(0.35 <= 0.30)` => `nodes[0] = int(False)` => `nodes[0] = 0`

- **Step 2:** Since `nodes[0] == 0` (condition not satisfied), evaluate `nodes[1]`:
  - `nodes[1] = int(X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05)`
  - `nodes[1] = int(0.07 <= 0.05)` => `nodes[1] = int(False)` => `nodes[1] = 0`

- **Step 3:** Since both conditions are not satisfied (`nodes = [0, 0]`), the company is classified as **Solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

**Important Notes:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - The feature keys in the input dictionary `X` must match exactly as specified:
    - `'EBIT/TA'`, `'NI/TC'`, `'Sales/TA'`, `'EBIT/Sales'`, `'NI/Sales'`, `'WC/TA'`, `'Equity/TL'`, `'Equity/TA'`.
    - Pay attention to capitalization and special characters.

- **Thresholds:**
  - The thresholds (`0.30` for `Equity/TA` and `0.05` for `EBIT/TA`) are derived from financial analysis and are meaningful for determining solvency.
  - In practice, these thresholds should be determined based on statistical analysis of real data.

**Feature Descriptions:**

- **EBIT/TA:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.
- **NI/TC:** Net Income divided by Total Capital.
- **Sales/TA:** Sales divided by Total Assets.
- **EBIT/Sales:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Sales.
- **NI/Sales:** Net Income divided by Sales.
- **WC/TA:** Working Capital divided by Total Assets.
- **Equity/TL:** Equity divided by Total Liabilities.
- **Equity/TA:** Equity divided by Total Assets.

**Target Variable:**

- **Company is Solvent:** Indicates whether the company is solvent.
  - `1` = Solvent.
  - `0` = Not Solvent (Insolvent).

By using this function, you can classify companies based on their financial ratios and understand which conditions led to the classification through the `nodes` list.
