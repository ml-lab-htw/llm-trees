Certainly! Based on the financial ratios provided and the importance of the **Working Capital / Total Assets (WC/TA)** ratio in assessing a company's short-term financial health, we'll construct the decision tree classifier.

Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    # Threshold for WC/TA ratio set at 0.2
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Used**: `'WC/TA'` (Working Capital / Total Assets)
- **Threshold**: `0.2`
  - A **WC/TA** ratio of **0.2** means the company's working capital is 20% of its total assets.
  - Companies with a **WC/TA** ratio **less than or equal to 0.2** may have insufficient short-term assets to cover short-term liabilities, indicating potential insolvency risk.
- **Nodes List**:
  - `nodes[0]` stores the boolean result of the condition `X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2`.
    - `1` if the condition is **True** (WC/TA ≤ 0.2).
    - `0` if the condition is **False** (WC/TA > 0.2).

### How to Use the Function:

- **Input**: A dictionary `X` containing the financial ratios with keys exactly as specified:

  ```python
  X = {
      'EBIT/TA': ...,
      'NI/TC': ...,
      'Sales/TA': ...,
      'EBIT/Sales': ...,
      'NI/Sales': ...,
      'WC/TA': ...,          # Working Capital / Total Assets
      'Equity/TL': ...,
      'Equity/TA': ...
  }
  ```
  
- **Output**:
  - `prediction`: `1` if the company is predicted to be **Solvent**, `0` if **Insolvent**.
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value (`1` or `0`) of the condition at each node.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example company data
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.15,
    'NI/TC': 0.10,
    'Sales/TA': 0.80,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.18,
    'NI/Sales': 0.12,
    'WC/TA': 0.18,      # Example WC/TA ratio
    'Equity/TL': 1.5,
    'Equity/TA': 0.60
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")   # 0 = Insolvent, 1 = Solvent
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")             # Truth values of the conditions
```

### Interpretation of the Output:

- **Prediction**:
  - `0`: The company is predicted to be **Insolvent**.
  - `1`: The company is predicted to be **Solvent**.
- **Nodes**:
  - `[1]`: The condition `X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2` is **True**.
  - `[0]`: The condition is **False**.

### Rationale for Threshold Selection:

- **Threshold of 0.2 for WC/TA**:
  - **Industry Standard**: A **WC/TA** ratio below **0.2** can be a red flag indicating potential liquidity issues.
  - **Financial Health**:
    - **WC/TA ≤ 0.2**: May suggest the company lacks sufficient short-term assets, increasing insolvency risk.
    - **WC/TA > 0.2**: Indicates better liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Notes:

- The function follows the user's specified format, with careful attention to feature keys and the target variable encoding.
- This simple decision tree provides a quick assessment based on a crucial financial ratio but should be used in conjunction with more comprehensive analysis for critical decisions.
