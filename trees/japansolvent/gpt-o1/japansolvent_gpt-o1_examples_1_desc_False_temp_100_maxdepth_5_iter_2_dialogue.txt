Sure! Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier based on the features you've provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial ratios of a company and returns:

- `prediction`: The predicted class (`1` for **solvent**, `0` for **insolvent**).
- `nodes`: A list representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 5  # Initialize a list of 5 nodes with zeros
    # Node 0: Equity/TL <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 1.0)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.04
        nodes[1] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.04)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: NI/Sales <= 0.01
            nodes[2] = int(X['NI/Sales'] <= 0.01)
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: WC/TA <= 0.10
                nodes[3] = int(X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10)
                if nodes[3]:
                    # Prediction: Insolvent
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    # Prediction: Solvent
                    prediction = 1
            else:
                # Prediction: Solvent
                prediction = 1
        else:
            # Prediction: Solvent
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # Prediction: Solvent
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `Equity/TL` (Equity/Total Liabilities) **≤ 1.0**.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets) **≤ 0.04**.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `NI/Sales` (Net Income/Sales) **≤ 0.01**.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) **≤ 0.10**.
  - `nodes[4]`: Unused in this tree, remains `0`.
- Each `nodes[i]` is set to `1` if the condition is satisfied, otherwise `0`.
- The function follows the structure of the decision tree to arrive at the `prediction`.

**Feature Keys and Descriptions:**

- `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
- `'NI/TC'`: Net Income / Total Capital
- `'Sales/TA'`: Sales / Total Assets
- `'EBIT/Sales'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
- `'NI/Sales'`: Net Income / Sales
- `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital / Total Assets
- `'Equity/TL'`: Equity / Total Liabilities
- `'Equity/TA'`: Equity / Total Assets

**Target Variable:**

- **`company is solvent`**:
  - **`1`**: Solvent
  - **`0`**: Insolvent

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data for a company
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'NI/TC': 0.02,
    'Sales/TA': 1.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.05,
    'NI/Sales': 0.008,
    'WC/TA': 0.08,
    'Equity/TL': 0.8,
    'Equity/TA': 0.45
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Insolvent)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
```

**Interpreting the Output:**

- **Prediction**:
  - `0`: The company is predicted to be **insolvent**.
  - `1`: The company is predicted to be **solvent**.
- **Nodes List**:
  - A list of `1`s and `0`s indicating which conditions were satisfied.
  - In the example, the first four conditions were satisfied (`1`), leading to the prediction.

**Decision Tree Conditions Recap:**

1. **Node 0**: `Equity/TL` ≤ 1.0
   - If **Yes** (`1`), proceed to Node 1.
   - If **No** (`0`), predict **Solvent** (`1`).
2. **Node 1**: `EBIT/TA` ≤ 0.04
   - If **Yes** (`1`), proceed to Node 2.
   - If **No** (`0`), predict **Solvent** (`1`).
3. **Node 2**: `NI/Sales` ≤ 0.01
   - If **Yes** (`1`), proceed to Node 3.
   - If **No** (`0`), predict **Solvent** (`1`).
4. **Node 3**: `WC/TA` ≤ 0.10
   - If **Yes** (`1`), predict **Insolvent** (`0`).
   - If **No** (`0`), predict **Solvent** (`1`).

**Important Notes:**

- The function strictly uses the **exact feature keys** as provided.
- Thresholds are set to meaningful values based on typical financial ratios.
- The decision tree has a **maximum depth of 5**, with `nodes` list accommodating up to 5 nodes.
- Unused nodes in the `nodes` list are set to `0`.

I hope this function meets your requirements and helps you classify companies based on their financial features!
