```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the first decision node:
  - `nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.5`
    - Checks if the **Equity/Total Liabilities** ratio is less than or equal to **0.5**.
- **nodes[1]** corresponds to the second decision node:
  - `nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1`
    - Checks if the **Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets** ratio is less than or equal to **0.1**.

**Decision Logic:**

1. **If** `nodes[0]` is **True** (i.e., `Equity/TL` ≤ 0.5):
   - The company is classified as **Not Solvent** (`prediction = 0`).
2. **Else** (i.e., `Equity/TL` > 0.5):
   - **If** `nodes[1]` is **True** (i.e., `EBIT/TA` ≤ 0.1):
     - The company is classified as **Not Solvent** (`prediction = 0`).
   - **Else** (i.e., `EBIT/TA` > 0.1):
     - The company is classified as **Solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a company with the following financial ratios:

```python
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.12,
    'NI/TC': 0.08,
    'Sales/TA': 1.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.08,
    'NI/Sales': 0.05,
    'WC/TA': 0.2,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Solvent'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Solvent
Nodes: [False, False]
```

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = False` means `Equity/TL` > 0.5
  - `nodes[1] = False` means `EBIT/TA` > 0.1
- Since both conditions are **False**, according to our decision tree, the company is classified as **Solvent**.

---

**Note:** The thresholds used (`0.5` for `Equity/TL` and `0.1` for `EBIT/TA`) are based on common financial benchmarks:

- A **Equity/Total Liabilities** ratio greater than **0.5** suggests the company has more equity than debt, indicating financial stability.
- An **EBIT/Total Assets** ratio greater than **0.1** implies the company is effectively generating earnings from its assets.

Feel free to adjust the thresholds based on specific industry standards or additional data you may have.
