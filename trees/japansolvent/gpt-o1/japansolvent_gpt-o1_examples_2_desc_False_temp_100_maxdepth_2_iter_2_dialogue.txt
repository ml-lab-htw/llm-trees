---

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Equity/TA <= 0.4
    nodes[0] = int(X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.4)
    
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # If Equity/TA <= 0.4, classify as Insolvent
        prediction = 0
        # Node 1 is not evaluated since the left child is a leaf node
        nodes[1] = None
    else:
        # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.08
        nodes[1] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.08)
        
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            # If EBIT/TA <= 0.08, classify as Insolvent
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If EBIT/TA > 0.08, classify as Solvent
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:**
  - `X`: A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys must exactly match the feature names:
    - `'EBIT/TA'`
    - `'NI/TC'`
    - `'Sales/TA'`
    - `'EBIT/Sales'`
    - `'NI/Sales'`
    - `'WC/TA'`
    - `'Equity/TL'`
    - `'Equity/TA'`

- **Outputs:**
  - `prediction`: An integer representing the classification (1 = Solvent, 0 = Insolvent).
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values (1 or 0) of the inner nodes:
    - `nodes[0]`: Result of the condition `Equity/TA <= 0.4`
    - `nodes[1]`: Result of the condition `EBIT/TA <= 0.08` (only evaluated if `nodes[0] == 0`)

- **Decision Tree Logic:**

  1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if `'Equity/TA'` is less than or equal to `0.4`.
     - If **Yes (`nodes[0] == 1`)**:
       - The company is classified as **Insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
       - The second node (`nodes[1]`) is **not evaluated** and set to `None`.
     - If **No (`nodes[0] == 0`)**:
       - Proceed to evaluate the second node.

  2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if `'EBIT/TA'` is less than or equal to `0.08`.
     - If **Yes (`nodes[1] == 1`)**:
       - The company is classified as **Insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **No (`nodes[1] == 0`)**:
       - The company is classified as **Solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Thresholds Used:**
  - `Equity/TA` threshold of `0.4` implies that companies with equity financing less than or equal to 40% of their total assets are at a higher risk of insolvency.
  - `EBIT/TA` threshold of `0.08` suggests that companies with earnings before interest and taxes less than or equal to 8% of their total assets may be insolvent.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Sample feature dictionary for a company
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'NI/TC': 0.1,
    'Sales/TA': 0.8,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.12,
    'NI/Sales': 0.08,
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.35
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = Solvent, 0 = Insolvent)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0 (1 = Solvent, 0 = Insolvent)
Nodes: [1, None]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] == 1` because `'Equity/TA'` is `0.35` which is less than or equal to `0.4`.
- Since `nodes[0] == 1`, the company is classified as **Insolvent**, and `nodes[1]` is not evaluated (`None`).

---

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the feature keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the specified keys, including capitalization and special characters.
- The function can be integrated into a larger system for batch processing or unit testing.
- The thresholds used are meaningful values typically derived from financial analysis and industry benchmarks.
