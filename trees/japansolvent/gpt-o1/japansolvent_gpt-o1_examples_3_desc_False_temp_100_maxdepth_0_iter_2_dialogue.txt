Sure! Based on the decision tree and the features you've provided, here's the Python function `predict` that encapsulates the decision tree logic. The function returns the prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 3  # We have 3 decision nodes in the tree

    # Evaluate conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.0

    # Follow the decision tree logic to make a prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 0 condition is True: Equity/TL <= 0.5
        # Classify as Not Solvent (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 0 condition is False: Equity/TL > 0.5
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 1 condition is True: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
            # Classify as Not Solvent (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 1 condition is False: EBIT/TA > 0.05
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 2 condition is True: WC/TA <= 0
                # Classify as Not Solvent (0)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # Node 2 condition is False: WC/TA > 0
                # Classify as Solvent (1)
                prediction = 1

    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'Equity/TL'` (Equity/Total Liabilities)
  - `'EBIT/TA'` (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets)
  - `'WC/TA'` (Working Capital/Total Assets)

- **Thresholds:**
  - **Node 0:** `Equity/TL <= 0.5`
  - **Node 1:** `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`
  - **Node 2:** `WC/TA <= 0.0`

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the truth value of the first condition.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second condition.
  - `nodes[2]` corresponds to the third condition.
  - Each node is `1` if the condition is satisfied (`True`), and `0` otherwise (`False`).

**Usage Example:**

Let's test the function with some sample data.

```python
# Sample company financial data
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.08,
    'NI/TC': 0.1,
    'Sales/TA': 0.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.2,
    'NI/Sales': 0.15,
    'WC/TA': 0.02,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.55
}

# Predict solvency
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = Solvent, 0 = Not Solvent)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1 (1 = Solvent, 0 = Not Solvent)
Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: `Equity/TL` is **not** less than or equal to `0.5` (since `Equity/TL = 0.6`).
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: `EBIT/TA` is **not** less than or equal to `0.05` (since `EBIT/TA = 0.08`).
  - `nodes[2] = 0`: `WC/TA` is **not** less than or equal to `0.0` (since `WC/TA = 0.02`).

- Since all node conditions are `False` after the first node, the company is classified as **Solvent** (`1`).

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic provided.
- Placeholder thresholds have been filled with meaningful financial thresholds as per standard financial analysis.
- Make sure to input all required features in the correct format when using the function.

**Feature Dictionary Keys:**

Please ensure that the keys in your input dictionary `X` exactly match the following:

- `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
- `'NI/TC'`: Net Income / Total Capital
- `'Sales/TA'`: Sales / Total Assets
- `'EBIT/Sales'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
- `'NI/Sales'`: Net Income / Sales
- `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital / Total Assets
- `'Equity/TL'`: Equity / Total Liabilities
- `'Equity/TA'`: Equity / Total Assets

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `1`: Solvent
- `0`: Not Solvent (Insolvent)

**Understanding the Decision Path:**

Here's how the function makes the prediction step-by-step:

1. **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):**
   - **Condition:** `Equity/TL <= 0.5`
   - **Interpretation:** 
     - If the company's equity is less than or equal to 50% of its total liabilities, it's highly leveraged.
   - **Result in Example:** `0.6 <= 0.5` ➔ `False` (`nodes[0] = 0`)

2. **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):**
   - **Condition:** `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`
   - **Interpretation:** 
     - If the company's earnings are less than or equal to 5% of its total assets, it's not generating enough income from its assets.
   - **Result in Example:** `0.08 <= 0.05` ➔ `False` (`nodes[1] = 0`)

3. **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):**
   - **Condition:** `WC/TA <= 0.0`
   - **Interpretation:** 
     - If the company's working capital is less than or equal to zero, it may face liquidity issues.
   - **Result in Example:** `0.02 <= 0.0` ➔ `False` (`nodes[2] = 0`)

4. **Final Prediction:**
   - Since all conditions lead to the company not being flagged for solvency issues, the company is classified as **Solvent** (`1`).

**Remember:**

- This function is a simplified model based on the decision tree provided. In practice, financial analysis may require more complex models and consideration of additional factors.
- Always ensure that the input data is accurate and up-to-date for reliable predictions.
