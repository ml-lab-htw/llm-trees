Sure! Here's the Python function `predict` based on the decision tree provided. It returns a single prediction (`1` for "Solvent", `0` for "Insolvent") and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries in the list are `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.40)
    nodes[1] = int(X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05)
    nodes[2] = int(X["NI/Sales"] <= 0.02)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Equity/TA"`: Equity/Total Assets
  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets
  - `"NI/Sales"`: Net Income/Sales

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if `Equity/TA` is less than or equal to `0.40`.
     - **Interpretation:** Companies with less than or equal to 40% equity financing are more leveraged.
  2. **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): If `nodes[0]` is `True`, check if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.05`.
     - **Interpretation:** Low operational profitability relative to assets may indicate insolvency.
  3. **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): If `nodes[0]` is `False`, check if `NI/Sales` is less than or equal to `0.02`.
     - **Interpretation:** Low net profitability from sales may signal solvency issues even with higher equity levels.

- **Prediction:**
  - Returns `0` for "Insolvent" and `1` for "Solvent" based on the decision path.

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - Each element in the `nodes` list is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
    - `nodes[0]`: `1` if `Equity/TA <= 0.40`, else `0`.
    - `nodes[1]`: `1` if `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`, else `0`. Evaluated regardless of `nodes[0]`.
    - `nodes[2]`: `1` if `NI/Sales <= 0.02`, else `0`. Evaluated regardless of `nodes[0]`.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Sample input data
X_example = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.04,
    'NI/TC': 0.03,
    'Sales/TA': 1.2,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.08,
    'NI/Sales': 0.015,
    'WC/TA': 0.1,
    'Equity/TL': 0.5,
    'Equity/TA': 0.35
}

# Making a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Insolvent
Nodes: [1, 1, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: `Equity/TA` is less than or equal to `0.40`.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.05`.
  - `nodes[2] = 1`: `NI/Sales` is less than or equal to `0.02` (evaluated but not used in this path).

**Notes:**

- The function assumes all required features are present in the input dictionary `X` with exact keys as specified.
- All thresholds are filled with meaningful values based on financial knowledge and the provided decision tree.
- The function follows the maximum depth of 3 as specified.
- Conditions are evaluated regardless of the path to ensure `nodes` contains the truth values for all inner nodes.
