The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None, None]  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = int(X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.0)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Equity/TL <= 1.0
        # Node 1: Check Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = int(X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05)
        nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 is not evaluated in this branch
        if nodes[1]:  # If NI/TC <= 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If NI/TC > 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:  # If Equity/TL > 1.0
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated in this branch
        # Node 2: Check EBIT/TA <= 0.08
        nodes[2] = int(X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08)
        if nodes[2]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.08
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.08
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Equity/TL"`: Equity divided by Total Liabilities.
  - `"NI/TC"`: Net Income divided by Total Capital.
  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates the first condition `Equity/TL <= 1.0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates the second condition `NI/TC <= 0.05` if applicable.
  - `nodes[2]`: Evaluates the third condition `EBIT/TA <= 0.08` if applicable.
  - Entries are set to `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` if not, and `None` if the node is not evaluated in that path.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Split** (`nodes[0]`):
     - Checks if `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to `1.0`.
  2. **Second Split**:
     - If `nodes[0] == 1`:
       - Evaluate `nodes[1]`: Check if `NI/TC` is less than or equal to `0.05`.
         - If `nodes[1] == 1`: Predict **Insolvent** (`0`).
         - If `nodes[1] == 0`: Predict **Solvent** (`1`).
     - If `nodes[0] == 0`:
       - Evaluate `nodes[2]`: Check if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.08`.
         - If `nodes[2] == 1`: Predict **Insolvent** (`0`).
         - If `nodes[2] == 0`: Predict **Solvent** (`1`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input data
X_sample = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.10,
    "NI/TC": 0.04,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.12,
    "NI/Sales": 0.08,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 0.8,
    "Equity/TA": 0.44
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print(f"Nodes values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Insolvent
Nodes values: [1, 1, None]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] == 1` because `Equity/TL (0.8) <= 1.0`.
- `nodes[1] == 1` because `NI/TC (0.04) <= 0.05`.
- `nodes[2] == None` because it's not evaluated in this path.
- The company is predicted to be **Insolvent** (`0`).

**Threshold Justification:**

- **Equity/Total Liabilities <= 1.0:**
  - A value less than or equal to `1.0` indicates that the company's liabilities are greater than or equal to its equity, which could be a sign of financial vulnerability.
- **Net Income/Total Capital <= 0.05:**
  - A return on total capital of `5%` or less may indicate low profitability.
- **EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.08:**
  - An EBIT to total assets ratio of `8%` or less suggests that the company is not efficiently generating earnings from its assets.

These thresholds are meaningful values commonly used in financial analysis to assess a company's solvency and operational efficiency.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that when using this function, all required features are present in the input dictionary `X` with the exact keys as specified.
- The function assumes that all input values are numerical and properly preprocessed.
