Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier you requested. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a single prediction (`1` for **solvent**, `0` for **insolvent**) along with a list of truth values of the inner nodes. The entries in the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.5)
    nodes[1] = int(X['NI/TC'] <= 0.1)
    nodes[2] = int(X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2)

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 0: Equity/TL <= 0.5
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        # Equity/TL > 0.5
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 1: NI/TC <= 0.1
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            # NI/TC > 0.1
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 2: WC/TA <= 0.2
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                # WC/TA > 0.2
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
  - `'NI/TC'`: Net Income / Total Capital
  - `'Sales/TA'`: Sales / Total Assets
  - `'EBIT/Sales'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
  - `'NI/Sales'`: Net Income / Sales
  - `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital / Total Assets
  - `'Equity/TL'`: Equity / Total Liabilities
  - `'Equity/TA'`: Equity / Total Assets

- **Target Variable:**
  - **company is solvent** (`1` = solvent, `0` = insolvent)

**Nodes Explanation:**

1. **Node 0**: Checks if `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to `0.5`.
   - If **True** (`nodes[0] = 1`), the company is classified as **Insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If **False**, proceed to **Node 1**.

2. **Node 1**: Checks if `NI/TC` is less than or equal to `0.1`.
   - If **True** (`nodes[1] = 1`), the company is classified as **Insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If **False**, proceed to **Node 2**.

3. **Node 2**: Checks if `WC/TA` is less than or equal to `0.2`.
   - If **True** (`nodes[2] = 1`), the company is classified as **Insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If **False**, the company is classified as **Solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

**Thresholds Explanation:**

- **`Equity/TL <= 0.5`**: A low equity-to-liabilities ratio indicates high leverage and potential solvency issues.
- **`NI/TC <= 0.1`**: Low net income relative to total capital suggests poor profitability.
- **`WC/TA <= 0.2`**: Low working capital relative to total assets indicates potential liquidity problems.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example feature values for a company
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.15,
    'NI/TC': 0.12,
    'Sales/TA': 0.8,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.1,
    'NI/Sales': 0.05,
    'WC/TA': 0.25,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Solvent)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- **Node 0**: `Equity/TL` is `0.6`, which is greater than `0.5`, so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- **Node 1**: `NI/TC` is `0.12`, which is greater than `0.1`, so `nodes[1] = 0`.
- **Node 2**: `WC/TA` is `0.25`, which is greater than `0.2`, so `nodes[2] = 0`.
- The company is classified as **Solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

**Note:**

- The function strictly follows the structure of the decision tree and uses the exact feature keys as specified.
- The `nodes` list contains `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise, representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
- Thresholds have been chosen based on common financial ratios that indicate solvency issues. They are illustrative and should be adjusted based on actual data analysis for precise modeling.

**Remember:**

- **Solvent Company (`prediction = 1`)**: Indicates the company is financially healthy.
- **Insolvent Company (`prediction = 0`)**: Indicates potential financial distress.
