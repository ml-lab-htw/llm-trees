Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict` that implements the decision tree classifier based on the financial ratios provided. The function returns a prediction indicating whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0), as well as a list representing the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes corresponding to the conditions in the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 4  # Initialize a list of 4 elements to store the truth values

    # Evaluate the conditions at each node and store 1 if True, 0 if False
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.5 else 0
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05 else 0
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['NI/TC'] <= 0.05 else 0
    nodes[3] = 1 if X['Sales/TA'] <= 0.70 else 0

    # Traverse the decision tree using the evaluated conditions
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # Node 0 condition satisfied: Equity/TL <= 0.5
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            # Node 1 condition satisfied: WC/TA <= 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2] == 1:
                # Node 2 condition satisfied: NI/TC <= 0.05
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                if nodes[3] == 1:
                    # Node 3 condition satisfied: Sales/TA <= 0.70
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
                else:
                    # All conditions not satisfied leading to this leaf
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values of a company. The keys of this dictionary must match exactly with the feature names:
  - `'EBIT/TA'`, `'NI/TC'`, `'Sales/TA'`, `'EBIT/Sales'`, `'NI/Sales'`, `'WC/TA'`, `'Equity/TL'`, `'Equity/TA'`
  
- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents whether **Equity/TL ≤ 0.50**
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents whether **WC/TA ≤ 0.05**
  - `nodes[2]`: Represents whether **NI/TC ≤ 0.05**
  - `nodes[3]`: Represents whether **Sales/TA ≤ 0.70**
  - Each element in the `nodes` list is set to **1** if the condition is **True** and **0** if **False**.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - The function traverses the decision tree using nested `if` statements based on the truth values in `nodes`.
  - If at any point a condition is satisfied (node value is `1`), and it leads to a leaf node, the function assigns the corresponding prediction.
  - The path followed in the tree depends on the sequence of conditions met.

- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: An integer value where `1` indicates the company is **solvent**, and `0` indicates **insolvent**.
  - `nodes`: A list of integers `[nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2], nodes[3]]`, where each element is `1` if the condition is satisfied or `0` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.08,
    'NI/TC': 0.06,
    'Sales/TA': 0.75,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.15,
    'NI/Sales': 0.10,
    'WC/TA': 0.10,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.55
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Solvent
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that all feature keys in the input dictionary `X` are spelled exactly as specified, including capitalization and symbols.
- The function can be used to predict the solvency of any company by supplying the appropriate financial ratios.
- The thresholds used in the conditions are based on meaningful values that are significant indicators of a company's financial health.

**Feature Descriptions:**

- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.
- **NI/TC**: Net Income divided by Total Capital.
- **Sales/TA**: Sales divided by Total Assets.
- **EBIT/Sales**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Sales.
- **NI/Sales**: Net Income divided by Sales.
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital divided by Total Assets.
- **Equity/TL**: Equity divided by Total Liabilities.
- **Equity/TA**: Equity divided by Total Assets.

**Target Variable:**

- **Company is Solvent**: 
  - `1`: Solvent
  - `0`: Insolvent
