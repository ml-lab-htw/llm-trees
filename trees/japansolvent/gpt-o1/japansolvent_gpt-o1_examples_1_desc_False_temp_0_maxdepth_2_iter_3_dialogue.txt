**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **NI/TC Calculation:**  The provided features don't directly include `NI/TC` (Net Income/Total Assets).  In a real application, you would calculate this from `NI/TC` (Net Income/Total Capital) and `Equity/TA`, or have access to `NI/TC` directly.  For this hypothetical example, we assume `NI/TC` is available.  If you only have `NI/TC`,  a simplification could be to use `NI/TC` directly as a proxy for profitability, though this isn't ideal.
* **Thresholds:** The 0.20 threshold for `Equity/TA` and 0.05 for `NI/TC` remain hypothetical.  These would be determined through data analysis and model training in a real application.
* **Feature Importance:** The choice of `Equity/TA` and `NI/TC` is based on general financial principles.  In a real-world scenario, you would use feature importance from a trained decision tree model to select the most relevant features.
* **Depth Limitation:**  The depth of 2 is a significant constraint.  A deeper tree could capture more complex relationships and potentially improve predictive accuracy.


This improved function provides a clearer and more practical example of a decision tree classifier for insolvency prediction while adhering to the specified format and constraints.  Remember, for a real application, you would use a machine learning library to train a model on actual data.
