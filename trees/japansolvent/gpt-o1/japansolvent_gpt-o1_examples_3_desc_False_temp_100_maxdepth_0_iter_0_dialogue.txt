The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, where each entry is `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = [None] * 3

    # Node 0: Equity/TL <= 0.5
    nodes[0] = int(X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.5)

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.08
        nodes[1] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.08)

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: NI/Sales <= 0.02
            nodes[2] = int(X['NI/Sales'] <= 0.02)

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        # When Equity/TL > 0.5, we directly predict Solvent
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
        nodes[1] = None  # Nodes 1 and 2 are not evaluated
        nodes[2] = None

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'Equity/TL'`: Equity divided by Total Liabilities.
  - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.
  - `'NI/Sales'`: Net Income divided by Sales.

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates the condition `Equity/TL <= 0.5`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates `EBIT/TA <= 0.08` (only if `nodes[0]` is `1`).
  - `nodes[2]`: Evaluates `NI/Sales <= 0.02` (only if both `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are `1`).
  - Entries are set to `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` if not, and `None` if not evaluated.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'NI/TC': 0.1,
    'Sales/TA': 0.8,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.15,
    'NI/Sales': 0.01,
    'WC/TA': 0.2,
    'Equity/TL': 0.4,
    'Equity/TA': 0.6
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Insolvent
Nodes truth values: [1, 1, 1]
```

In this example, the company is predicted to be **Insolvent** because it satisfies all the conditions leading to the **Insolvent** classification.

**Note:** Ensure that all keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the specified feature keys, including capitalization and special characters.

**Decision Tree Logic:**

```
|--- Equity/TL <= 0.5
    |--- EBIT/TA <= 0.08
        |--- NI/Sales <= 0.02
            |--- class: Insolvent (0)
        |--- NI/Sales > 0.02
            |--- class: Solvent (1)
    |--- EBIT/TA > 0.08
        |--- class: Solvent (1)
|--- Equity/TL > 0.5
    |--- class: Solvent (1)
```

- **Leaf Nodes:**
  - If a company's `Equity/TL` ratio is low (â‰¤ 0.5), and its `EBIT/TA` and `NI/Sales` ratios are also low, it's classified as **Insolvent**.
  - In all other cases, the company is classified as **Solvent**.

**Function Details:**

- **Input:**
  - `X`: A dictionary with the company's financial ratios.
    - Expected keys: `'EBIT/TA'`, `'NI/TC'`, `'Sales/TA'`, `'EBIT/Sales'`, `'NI/Sales'`, `'WC/TA'`, `'Equity/TL'`, `'Equity/TA'`
- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: An integer where `1` indicates the company is **Solvent**, and `0` indicates **Insolvent**.
  - `nodes`: A list containing `1`, `0`, or `None`:
    - `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied.
    - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
    - `None` if the node was not evaluated due to the tree's decision path.

Feel free to use this function as part of your classification system for predicting company solvency based on financial ratios.
