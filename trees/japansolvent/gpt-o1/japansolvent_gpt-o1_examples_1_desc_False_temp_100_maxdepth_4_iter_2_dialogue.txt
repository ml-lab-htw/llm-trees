```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Equity/TL <= 0.5
    nodes[0] = int(X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Left branch: Insolvent
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        nodes[1] = None
        nodes[2] = None
        nodes[3] = None
    else:
        # Node 1: WC/TA <= 0.10
        nodes[1] = int(X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Left branch: Insolvent
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            nodes[2] = None
            nodes[3] = None
        else:
            # Node 2: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
            nodes[2] = int(X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05)
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Equity/TA <= 0.6
                nodes[3] = int(X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.6)
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
                nodes[3] = None
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` with 4 `None` elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Each node corresponds to a decision in the tree.

- **Node Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates the condition `Equity/TL <= 0.5`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates `WC/TA <= 0.10` if `nodes[0]` is `False` (i.e., `Equity/TL > 0.5`).
  - `nodes[2]`: Evaluates `EBIT/TA <= 0.05` if `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are both `False`.
  - `nodes[3]`: Evaluates `Equity/TA <= 0.6` if `nodes[2]` is `True`.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (`Equity/TL` is less than or equal to 0.5), the company is predicted to be **Insolvent** (`0`), and no further conditions are checked.
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False` and `nodes[1]` is `True` (`WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.10), the prediction is **Insolvent** (`0`).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False`, `nodes[1]` is `False`, and `nodes[2]` is `True` (`EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05), we check `nodes[3]`:
    - If `nodes[3]` is `True` (`Equity/TA` is less than or equal to 0.6), the prediction is **Insolvent** (`0`).
    - If `nodes[3]` is `False`, the prediction is **Solvent** (`1`).
  - If `nodes[2]` is `False` (`EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.05), the prediction is **Solvent** (`1`).

- **Return Value:** The function returns the `prediction` (either `0` for Insolvent or `1` for Solvent) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes.

**Note:** The thresholds used in the conditions (e.g., `0.5`, `0.10`, `0.05`, `0.6`) are meaningful values chosen based on typical financial ratios that might indicate solvency.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.06,
    'NI/TC': 0.08,
    'Sales/TA': 1.2,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.05,
    'NI/Sales': 0.04,
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.65
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

This function will allow you to classify whether a company is solvent or insolvent based on the provided financial ratios, and it will also give you insight into which conditions were met during the classification process.
