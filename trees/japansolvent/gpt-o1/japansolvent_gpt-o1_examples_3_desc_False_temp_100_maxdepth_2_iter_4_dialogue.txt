Certainly! Here's the `predict` function formatted as per your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TL'] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.08

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Non-Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation**:

- **Features Used**:
  - `'Equity/TL'`: Equity / Total Liabilities
  - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets

- **Thresholds**:
  - **Equity/TL ≤ 0.5**:
    - Companies with Equity less than or equal to 50% of their Total Liabilities are predicted to be **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
  - **EBIT/TA ≤ 0.08**:
    - For companies with higher Equity relative to Liabilities, an EBIT relative to Total Assets of 8% or less indicates potential insolvency (`prediction = 0`).
  - **Otherwise**:
    - Companies exceeding both thresholds are predicted to be **solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Nodes Array**:
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates to `1` if `Equity/TL ≤ 0.5`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates to `1` if `EBIT/TA ≤ 0.08`, else `0`.
  - The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes:
    - `1` if the condition is **satisfied**.
    - `0` if the condition is **not satisfied**.

**Usage Example**:

```python
# Sample input features
X_sample = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.10,
    'NI/TC': 0.05,
    'Sales/TA': 1.2,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.08,
    'NI/Sales': 0.04,
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'Equity/TL': 0.6,
    'Equity/TA': 0.3
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Nodes evaluations:", nodes)
```

**Output**:

```
Prediction: Solvent
Nodes evaluations: [False, False]
```

**Notes**:

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct spelling and capitalization as specified:
  - `'EBIT/TA'`, `'NI/TC'`, `'Sales/TA'`, `'EBIT/Sales'`, `'NI/Sales'`, `'WC/TA'`, `'Equity/TL'`, `'Equity/TA'`
- The thresholds (0.5 for `Equity/TL` and 0.08 for `EBIT/TA`) are based on meaningful financial ratios that typically indicate solvency status.
- The function aligns with your examples and provides both the prediction and the list of node evaluations.

Feel free to adjust the thresholds or expand the tree depth if more nuanced classification is needed!
