**Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # We have 3 inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Net Income / Total Capital <= 0.00
    nodes[0] = int(X["NI/TC"] <= 0.00)
    
    # Node 1: Equity / Total Liabilities <= 0.50
    nodes[1] = int(X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.50)
    
    # Node 2: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = int(X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05)
    
    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # If Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If Node 1 condition is satisfied
            if nodes[2]:  # If Node 2 condition is satisfied
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Nodes:**

1. **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):**
   - **Condition:** `X["NI/TC"] <= 0.00`
   - **Feature:** Net Income / Total Capital (`"NI/TC"`)
   - **Threshold:** `0.00`
   - **Interpretation:**
     - If the company's Net Income relative to Total Capital is zero or negative, it indicates lack of profitability, suggesting potential insolvency.
     - `nodes[0] = 1` if the condition is **True** (Insolvent indication).
     - `nodes[0] = 0` if the condition is **False**.

2. **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):**
   - **Condition:** `X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.50`
   - **Feature:** Equity / Total Liabilities (`"Equity/TL"`)
   - **Threshold:** `0.50`
   - **Interpretation:**
     - A lower ratio means the company has less equity relative to its liabilities, indicating higher financial risk.
     - `nodes[1] = 1` if the condition is **True** (Higher risk).
     - `nodes[1] = 0` if the condition is **False**.

3. **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):**
   - **Condition:** `X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05`
   - **Feature:** Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets (`"EBIT/TA"`)
   - **Threshold:** `0.05`
   - **Interpretation:**
     - Measures operational profitability relative to assets.
     - A lower ratio indicates the company is not efficiently generating earnings from its assets.
     - `nodes[2] = 1` if the condition is **True** (Lower profitability).
     - `nodes[2] = 0` if the condition is **False**.

**Decision Logic:**

- **If** `nodes[0] == 1`:
  - **Prediction:** `0` (Insolvent)
  - **Reasoning:** The company is not generating profit relative to capital.

- **Else** (`nodes[0] == 0`):
  - **If** `nodes[1] == 1`:
    - **If** `nodes[2] == 1`:
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Insolvent)
      - **Reasoning:** High financial risk and low profitability.
    - **Else** (`nodes[2] == 0`):
      - **Prediction:** `1` (Solvent)
      - **Reasoning:** Despite high risk, adequate profitability may indicate solvency.
  - **Else** (`nodes[1] == 0`):
    - **Prediction:** `1` (Solvent)
    - **Reasoning:** Sufficient equity relative to liabilities suggests financial stability.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input data
X = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.06,    # Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
    "NI/TC": 0.01,      # Net Income / Total Capital
    "Sales/TA": 1.2,    # Sales / Total Assets
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.08, # Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
    "NI/Sales": 0.05,   # Net Income / Sales
    "WC/TA": 0.15,      # Working Capital / Total Assets
    "Equity/TL": 0.45,  # Equity / Total Liabilities
    "Equity/TA": 0.30   # Equity / Total Assets
}

# Get the prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Solvent
Nodes: [0, 1, 0]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: `NI/TC` is greater than `0.00`
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to `0.50`
  - `nodes[2] = 0`: `EBIT/TA` is greater than `0.05`

- **Prediction:** Solvent (`1`)
  - Although the company has higher financial risk (`nodes[1] = 1`), its profitability (`nodes[2] = 0`) suggests it is solvent.

**Note on Thresholds:**

- The thresholds used (`0.00`, `0.50`, `0.05`) are meaningful values based on general financial ratios:
  - **Net Income / Total Capital ≤ 0.00:** No profit relative to capital.
  - **Equity / Total Liabilities ≤ 0.50:** High leverage, potential financial risk.
  - **EBIT / Total Assets ≤ 0.05:** Low operational profitability.

**Important Feature Keys:**

- Ensure that the keys in your input dictionary `X` exactly match the following:

  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
  - `"NI/TC"`: Net Income / Total Capital
  - `"Sales/TA"`: Sales / Total Assets
  - `"EBIT/Sales"`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
  - `"NI/Sales"`: Net Income / Sales
  - `"WC/TA"`: Working Capital / Total Assets
  - `"Equity/TL"`: Equity / Total Liabilities
  - `"Equity/TA"`: Equity / Total Assets

**Final Remarks:**

- This function provides a simple and interpretable way to predict a company's solvency based on key financial ratios.
- The `nodes` list allows you to trace which conditions influenced the prediction, which can be useful for analysis and debugging.
- Replace the placeholder values in the `X` dictionary with actual data from the company you wish to evaluate.
