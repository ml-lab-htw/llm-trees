Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1. This function predicts whether a company is **solvent** (`1`) or **insolvent** (`0`) based on the **Equity to Total Liabilities** ratio.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial features of a company. The keys in `X` should match exactly with the feature names provided:

  ```
  ['EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales', 'NI/Sales', 'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA']
  ```

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` to keep track of the truth value of the decision node:

  ```python
  nodes = 1 * [None]
  ```

- **Decision Node:** We evaluate the condition at the root of the decision tree:

  ```python
  nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 1.0
  ```

  - If `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to `1.0`, the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = True`), indicating potential insolvency.
  - If `Equity/TL` is greater than `1.0`, the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] = False`), indicating solvency.

- **Prediction:** Based on the truth value of `nodes[0]`, we make a prediction:

  ```python
  if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 0  # Insolvent
  else:
      prediction = 1  # Solvent
  ```

- **Output:** The function returns the `prediction` and the list of node evaluations `nodes`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input data
company_data = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.15,
    "NI/TC": 0.10,
    "Sales/TA": 0.80,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.18,
    "NI/Sales": 0.12,
    "WC/TA": 0.05,
    "Equity/TL": 0.85,  # Equity to Total Liabilities ratio
    "Equity/TA": 0.46
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print(f"Nodes Evaluation: {nodes}")
```

**Note:** Ensure that all feature values are provided correctly, and the keys in the input dictionary `X` match exactly with the specified feature names, including capitalization and special characters.
