Based on the features provided and the decision tree structure, here is the Python function that predicts whether a company is solvent (1) or insolvent (0). The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Function Implementation:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Company is insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Company is insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Company is solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Equity/TL"`: Equity divided by Total Liabilities.
  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes divided by Total Assets.
- **Threshold Values:**
  - **Equity/TL ≤ 0.5**: Indicates higher leverage (more liabilities relative to equity).
  - **EBIT/TA ≤ 0.10**: Indicates lower profitability relative to assets.

**Decision Logic:**

1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`):**
   - Check if `Equity/TL` is less than or equal to 0.5.
     - If **True** (`nodes[0] = True`):
       - The company is classified as **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **False** (`nodes[0] = False`):
       - Proceed to the second node.

2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):**
   - Check if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.10.
     - If **True** (`nodes[1] = True`):
       - The company is classified as **insolvent** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **False** (`nodes[1] = False`):
       - The company is classified as **solvent** (`prediction = 1`).

**Return Values:**

- `prediction`: An integer representing the classification of the company.
  - `0`: Company is **insolvent**.
  - `1`: Company is **solvent**.
- `nodes`: A list of boolean values indicating the truth value of each condition in the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Result of `X["Equity/TL"] <= 0.5`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Result of `X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10`.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.12,
    "NI/TC": 0.08,
    "Sales/TA": 0.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.15,
    "NI/Sales": 0.1,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 0.6,
    "Equity/TA": 0.4
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Solvent" if prediction == 1 else "Insolvent")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Solvent
Nodes: [False, False]
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with the exact spelling and case as specified:
  - `'EBIT/TA'`
  - `'Equity/TL'`
- The thresholds used in the conditions are illustrative and based on common financial analysis practices. In a real-world scenario, these would be determined through data analysis and may vary depending on industry standards and economic conditions.
- The function is designed with a maximum depth of 2, as per the requirement.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into the path taken through the decision tree for the given input.

**Feature Descriptions:**

- **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets):**
  - Measures operating profitability relative to total assets.
  - Higher values indicate better efficiency in generating earnings from assets.

- **Equity/TL (Equity / Total Liabilities):**
  - Indicates the proportion of equity financing relative to liabilities.
  - A higher ratio suggests lower financial leverage and potentially lower risk.

This function allows you to input a dictionary of financial ratios and receive a prediction on the company's solvency, along with the evaluation of each decision node in the tree.
