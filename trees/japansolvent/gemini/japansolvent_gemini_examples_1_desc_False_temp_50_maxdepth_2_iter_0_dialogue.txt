**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  I've set explicit thresholds for `NI/TC` (0.0) and `Equity/TL` (1.0), which are reasonable starting points. However, these should ideally be determined from training data using a decision tree learning algorithm.

2. **Conservative Predictions:** The original logic had "Possibly Solvent" outcomes.  In a real-world financial setting, erring on the side of caution is often prudent. I've adjusted the predictions to lean towards classifying potentially risky situations as "Insolvent" (0).  This reflects a more conservative approach where further investigation would be warranted even for "Possibly Solvent" cases.

3. **Feature Names:** The code now uses the correct feature names provided (e.g., "NI/TC", "Equity/TL").

4. **Type Hinting:** I've added type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code readability and maintainability.

5. **Docstring:**  A docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.

**Example Usage:**

```python
company_data = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'NI/TC': 0.03,
    'Sales/TA': 1.2,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.04,
    'NI/Sales': 0.025,
    'WC/TA': 0.2,
    'Equity/TL': 0.8,
    'Equity/TA': 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")      # Output: Nodes: [False, True] (Illustrative - will vary with data)

```


This improved function is more robust and better aligned with practical considerations for solvency prediction.  Remember that for real-world applications, you must train a decision tree model on a dataset to obtain optimal thresholds and potentially a more complex tree structure.
