```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.5  # Using Equity/TA as a likely important feature

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Likely solvent if Equity/TA is high
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Likely insolvent if Equity/TA is low

    return prediction, nodes
