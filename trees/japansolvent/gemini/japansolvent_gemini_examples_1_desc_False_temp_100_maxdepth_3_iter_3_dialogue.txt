This function directly implements the hypothetical decision tree logic described previously.  It uses the provided feature names and thresholds. Remember that without real-world training data, these thresholds and the tree structure itself are not optimized and only serve as a demonstration.  The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth value of each decision node, providing insights into the path taken through the tree for a given input.
