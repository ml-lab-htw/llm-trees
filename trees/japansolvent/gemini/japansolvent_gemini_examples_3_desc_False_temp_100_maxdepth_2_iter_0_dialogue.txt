I understand now! You need a Python function representing a decision tree with a specific format for predictions. Since I cannot train a model without data, I will create a sample decision tree based on financial intuition for the solvency prediction task. 

**Important Note:** The thresholds in this example are chosen for demonstration purposes and should not be considered financially accurate. To get meaningful thresholds, you need to train a decision tree model on real-world data.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of financial ratios.

    Returns:
        tuple: Prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list of truth values for inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None] 
    nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] >= 0.05  # Profitability: Is Net Income/Total Capital above 5%?
    nodes[1] = X['Equity/TL'] >= 0.3  # Leverage: Is Equity/Total Liabilities above 30%?
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] >= 0.2  # Liquidity: Is Working Capital/Total Assets above 20%? 

    if nodes[0]:  
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Solvent if profitable and low leverage 
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Insolvent if profitable but high leverage
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0 # Insolvent if not profitable and low liquidity
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Solvent if not profitable but high liquidity 

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage
company_data = {'EBIT/TA': 0.10, 'NI/TC': 0.03, 'Sales/TA': 1.5, 
               'EBIT/Sales': 0.07, 'NI/Sales': 0.02, 'WC/TA': 0.25, 
               'Equity/TL': 0.2, 'Equity/TA': 0.4}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict(X)` function:** 
   - Takes a dictionary `X` containing financial ratios as input.
   - Initializes a list `nodes` with `None` values, representing the truth values of inner nodes in the decision tree.
2. **Decision Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] >= 0.05`:  Checks if Net Income/Total Capital is greater than or equal to 5% (profitability).
   - `nodes[1] = X['Equity/TL'] >= 0.3`: Checks if Equity/Total Liabilities is greater than or equal to 30% (leverage).
   - `nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] >= 0.2`: Checks if Working Capital/Total Assets is greater than or equal to 20% (liquidity).
3. **Decision Logic (if-else statements):**
   - The nested `if-else` statements implement the decision tree logic.  A company is predicted as "Solvent" if it meets certain criteria related to profitability, leverage, and liquidity, otherwise it is classified as "Insolvent." 
4. **Output:**
   - Returns the `prediction` (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and the `nodes` list, which contains True/False values indicating the path taken through the decision tree.

This Python code demonstrates the format you requested. Remember that the financial logic and thresholds used are simplified for this example. To obtain a reliable model, train a decision tree classifier on your own labeled dataset using libraries like scikit-learn.
