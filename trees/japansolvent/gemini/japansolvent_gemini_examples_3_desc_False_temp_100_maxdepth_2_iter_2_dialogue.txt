I understand now. You want a Python function representing a decision tree for predicting company solvency based on financial ratios. However, I need data to determine appropriate thresholds for the features. 

**Here's a template for the function, assuming 'EBIT/TA' and 'NI/TC' are important features:**

```python
def predict_solvency(X: dict):
    """Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of financial ratios.

    Returns:
        tuple: Prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list of truth values for inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.05  # Placeholder threshold
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] > 0.10   # Placeholder threshold
    nodes[2] = ... # Placeholder for a potential third node 

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent if both conditions met
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent if EBIT/TA is high but NI/TC is low
    else:
        # Add logic based on other nodes or features if needed
        prediction = 0  # Likely insolvent if EBIT/TA is low

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_solvency(X: dict)`:** Defines the function with a dictionary `X` as input for the financial ratios.
2. **`nodes = 3 * [None]`:** Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values (True/False) of the decision nodes in the tree. The length should be equal to the number of inner nodes.
3. **`nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.05`:** This is the first decision node. It checks if the 'EBIT/TA' ratio is greater than 0.05 (this is a placeholder, you'll need data to determine a suitable threshold). The result (True/False) is stored in `nodes[0]`.
4. **`nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] > 0.10`:** This is the second decision node, active if `nodes[0]` is True. It checks if 'NI/TC' is greater than 0.10 (again, a placeholder). The result is stored in `nodes[1]`.
5. **`if nodes[0]: ...`:** The `if` statements implement the tree logic, leading to a prediction based on the truth values in `nodes`.
6. **`prediction = ...`:**  The final prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) is assigned based on the decision path.

**To complete this function:**

1. **Provide example company data** with financial ratios and solvency status so I can determine appropriate thresholds for the decision nodes.
2. **Clarify the desired depth of the tree.** Do you want a depth of 2 as in the template or a different depth? 

Once I have this information, I can create a more accurate and helpful `predict_solvency` function.
