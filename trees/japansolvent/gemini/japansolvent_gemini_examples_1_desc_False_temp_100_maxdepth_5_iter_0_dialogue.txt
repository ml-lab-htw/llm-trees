```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.2
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
    nodes[3] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent (Potentially weak)
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Possible outlier)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **List Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized to the correct size (4 in this case, as there are 4 inner nodes in our hypothetical tree).
* **Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided (e.g., "Equity/TA", "NI/TC").
* **Threshold Values:**  Reasonable placeholder values are used (0.2, 0.05, 0.1) for demonstration.  These would be learned from data in a real application.
* **Clearer Structure:** The `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making the code easier to understand and relate back to the tree.
* **Comments:** Added comments to indicate the predicted class (solvent/insolvent) at each leaf node, as well as notes about potential weaknesses or outliers based on the chosen thresholds.


This improved version addresses all the requirements and provides a more robust and understandable function for making predictions based on the hypothetical decision tree. Remember, this function is still based on a *hypothetical* tree structure and thresholds.  For a real-world application, you *must* train a decision tree model on real data to obtain meaningful results.
