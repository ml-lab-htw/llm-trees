```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.5  # Example threshold -  no data to determine a real one

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent if Equity/TA is low
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent if Equity/TA is high

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the generated code:**

Since you requested a decision tree of maximum depth 1 and no training data is provided, the generated tree uses a single feature and a simple threshold. I've selected `Equity/TA` as a potentially important feature for solvency prediction.  A company with a low Equity/Total Assets ratio may be considered financially weaker and thus more likely to be insolvent. The threshold of 0.5 is arbitrary in the absence of data; a real-world application would involve determining this threshold through training on a dataset.

The `nodes` list stores the truth value of the condition at the root node (depth 0).  This allows you to track which branch of the tree was taken for a given input.  If `Equity/TA` is less than or equal to 0.5, `nodes[0]` will be `True` (represented as 1 in your specification), and the prediction will be 0 (insolvent). Otherwise, `nodes[0]` will be `False` (0), and the prediction will be 1 (solvent).

**Important Note:**  Without training data, this decision tree is just a template.  The feature selection (`Equity/TA`) and the threshold (0.5) are purely illustrative and unlikely to be optimal for a real-world solvency prediction task.  You would need to train a decision tree on actual data to determine the best features and thresholds to use.
