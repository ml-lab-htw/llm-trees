**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Feature Importance (Intuitive):**  I've tried to select features and create splits based on some reasonable assumptions about financial health:
   - `EBIT/TA` and `NI/TC`:  Profitability relative to assets and capital is a strong indicator of solvency. Higher values suggest better financial health.
   - `Sales/TA`: Asset turnover.  Higher values suggest efficient use of assets to generate sales.
   - `EBIT/Sales`: Profit margin.  Higher values suggest efficient cost management.
   - `Equity/TA`:  Capital structure. Higher equity relative to assets generally indicates lower risk and better financial health.

2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds (e.g., 0.05 for `EBIT/TA`) are **examples**.  In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be determined by analyzing data or using domain expertise.  This is because the current example does not include real data.

3. **Tree Structure (Depth 5):**  The `if/else` structure creates a decision tree of depth 5.  Each `if` statement represents a node in the tree, and the conditions (e.g., `X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05`) are the splitting criteria.

4. **Predictions (Solvent/Insolvent):** The `prediction = 1` or `prediction = 0` at the leaf nodes represents the final classification (solvent or insolvent).  The logic of assigning these predictions is based on the assumed importance of the features. You would typically adjust these based on actual data or business rules.

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 or 0) for each of the inner node conditions.  This is useful for understanding the path taken through the tree for a given input.


**Important Notes:**

* **No Training:**  As requested, this decision tree is not trained on any data. The structure, feature selection, thresholds, and predictions are based on intuitive reasoning and would need to be refined with actual data.
* **Real-World Application:** In a real-world application, you would use a machine learning library like scikit-learn to train a decision tree classifier on real data to determine the optimal tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds.  This example demonstrates how to manually construct a decision tree function but is not a substitute for proper model training.
