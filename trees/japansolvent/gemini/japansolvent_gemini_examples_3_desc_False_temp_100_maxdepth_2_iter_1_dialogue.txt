I still need the training data to determine the most important features and appropriate thresholds. However, I can provide you with a Python function template based on your provided examples and incorporating the financial ratios for solvency prediction. 

This template assumes 'Equity/TA' and 'EBIT/TA' are the most important features, which is a placeholder assumption. You'll need to replace these features and thresholds with the actual ones determined from your data analysis.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the financial ratios of the company.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent)
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Example thresholds - REPLACE THESE with values from your data analysis
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.5  # Example: Companies with Equity/TA below 0.5 are more likely to be insolvent
    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.1  # Example: Companies with low EBIT/TA are more likely to be insolvent
    nodes[2] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.05 # Example: Placeholder for a second-level node

    # Decision tree logic (depth 2)
    if nodes[0]:  # If Equity/TA is below the threshold
        if nodes[1]:  # And EBIT/TA is also below its threshold
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Likely insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1 # Likely solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Likely solvent
    else:  # If Equity/TA is above the threshold
        prediction = 1  # Likely solvent

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Remember:**

- **Replace placeholders:** The features ('Equity/TA', 'EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC'), thresholds (0.5, 0.1, 0.05), and even the chosen features themselves are just examples. You **must** determine the actual important features and thresholds from your data analysis.
- **Adjust depth:** You can modify the depth of the decision tree by adding or removing nodes and conditions within the `if-else` statements. 
- **Consider more sophisticated models:** While a decision tree with depth 2 is a good starting point,  more complex models might be needed to capture the nuances of financial solvency prediction accurately.

Once you have the actual important features and thresholds, substitute them into this function template to get your custom solvency prediction function.
