I can help you create that Python function.  However, I need data to determine meaningful thresholds for the decision tree. 

**Here's a template function based on your example and a possible starting decision tree structure:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None] 
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.05  # Example threshold - needs data to refine
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] > 0.1  # Example threshold - needs data to refine
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.2  # Example threshold - needs data to refine
    nodes[3] = X['Equity/TL'] > 1.0  # Example threshold - needs data to refine

    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely solvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1 # Likely solvent
            else:
                prediction = 0 # Likely insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1 # Likely solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely insolvent 

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Function `predict(X: dict)`:**
    * Takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys are feature names and values are feature values for a single company.
    * Returns: 
        * `prediction`: The predicted solvency (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent).
        * `nodes`: A list representing the truth values of each inner node condition (1 if true, 0 if false).
* **Decision Tree Logic (Example):** 
    * The code implements a basic decision tree.  
    * The thresholds (e.g., `0.05`, `0.1`) are placeholders and **need to be determined from your data**.
* **Nodes List:**
    * Each element in the `nodes` list corresponds to the truth value (True/False or 1/0) of the condition at a specific node in the decision tree. This helps track the decision path.

**To complete this function and make it effective, you'll need to provide:**

1. **Training Data:**  A dataset of companies with the features listed and their known solvency status. I can then use this data to find the optimal thresholds for the decision tree splits. 
2. **Evaluation:** After training, we'll need to evaluate the tree's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well. 

Let me know when you have the data ready!
