**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* **`Equity/TL <= 0.5`:**  A ratio below 0.5 signifies that the company has more liabilities than equity. This is a strong indicator of potential insolvency.

* **`NI/TC <= 0.02`:** A Return on Assets (Net Income / Total Assets) of 2% or less suggests the company isn't generating much profit from its assets. Even if a company has decent equity/liabilities, a persistently low ROA can be a sign of trouble.

These thresholds are examples and would need to be adjusted based on a real dataset and training process.  The optimal values would depend on the specific distribution of the features and the target variable within your data.  You would typically use techniques like cross-validation to determine the best thresholds.
