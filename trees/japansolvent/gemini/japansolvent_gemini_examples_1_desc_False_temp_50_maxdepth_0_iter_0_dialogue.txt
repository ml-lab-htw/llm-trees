**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** Includes reasonable placeholder values for the thresholds based on typical financial analysis benchmarks.  These would be optimized in a real application.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose and arguments.
* **Return Format:** Returns the prediction and the list of node truth values as requested.
* **Added Depth/Complexity:** Added a couple more branches to the tree using `NI/Sales` and `Equity/TA` to make it slightly more nuanced and closer to a real-world scenario.  This demonstrates how additional relevant ratios can be incorporated.


This revised function is a much better representation of how a decision tree classifier could be implemented for solvency prediction, although it still relies on placeholder thresholds and requires training with real data for optimal performance. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values learned from a real dataset when you use this in practice.
