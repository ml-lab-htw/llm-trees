This function implements the previously described hypothetical decision tree logic. It takes a dictionary `X` representing the feature values for a single company and returns the predicted solvency (1 or 0) and a list of truth values corresponding to the conditions evaluated at each internal node.  Remember, this is a simplified example and needs real-world data and training for accurate predictions.  The thresholds used (e.g., `Sales/TA` <= 0.5) are illustrative and would need adjustment based on actual data analysis.
