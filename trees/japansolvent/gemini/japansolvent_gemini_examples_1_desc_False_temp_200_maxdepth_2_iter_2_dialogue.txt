Key improvements:

* **Clearer Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  Uses 0.20 for `Equity/TA` and 0.05 for `NI/TC` as reasonable, though still hypothetical, thresholds.
* **Comments:** Explains the rationale behind the thresholds and decision logic.
* **Example Usage:**  Demonstrates how to use the function.
* **Return format:** Returns the prediction and the node truth values as a tuple, matching the requested format.
* **Type Hinting:** Includes type hinting for better readability and maintainability.


This improved version is more practical and demonstrates the requested functionality more accurately. Remember that a real-world model would require data and training. This example is for illustrative purposes.
