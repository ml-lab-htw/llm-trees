I understand. You want a Python function representing a decision tree of depth 2 for predicting company solvency based on the provided financial features. 

**Without actual training data, I can't determine the optimal feature thresholds.**  However, I can create a function with placeholder thresholds and use financial intuition to make the example meaningful:

```python
def predict_solvency(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary of financial features. 
       Keys: 'EBIT/TA', 'NI/TC', 'Sales/TA', 'EBIT/Sales', 'NI/Sales', 
             'WC/TA', 'Equity/TL', 'Equity/TA'

  Returns:
    prediction: 1 if solvent, 0 if insolvent
    nodes: List of truth values for inner nodes (1 if condition met, 0 otherwise)
  """
  nodes = 2 * [None]

  # Node 1: High NI/TC often indicates solvency
  nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] >= 0.10  

  # Node 2:  Given high NI/TC, check if WC/TA is healthy (positive is generally good)
  nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.05

  if nodes[0]: # NI/TC is high
    if nodes[1]: # WC/TA is also healthy
      prediction = 1  # Likely solvent
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Potentially risky despite high NI/TC
  else: # NI/TC is low
    prediction = 0  # More likely to be insolvent 

  return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage
company_data = {'EBIT/TA': 0.05, 'NI/TC': 0.12, 'Sales/TA': 1.5, 
                'EBIT/Sales': 0.03, 'NI/Sales': 0.08, 
                'WC/TA': 0.15, 'Equity/TL': 0.7, 'Equity/TA': 0.6}

prediction, nodes = predict_solvency(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Solvent' if prediction == 1 else 'Insolvent'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 1:**  We use 'NI/TC' (Net Income/Total Capital) as the first split. A higher value generally suggests profitability and better solvency. The threshold of 0.10 is a placeholder; the optimal value would come from training data.
- **Node 2:** If 'NI/TC' is high, we look at 'WC/TA' (Working Capital/Total Assets). A positive 'WC/TA' usually indicates a company has enough liquid assets to cover short-term liabilities, which is important for solvency.

**Important:**

- This example uses simplified logic and placeholders.  **Real-world solvency prediction requires more complex models and rigorous analysis.**
- **To get a more accurate and reliable decision tree, provide me with the labeled training data.** I can then determine the optimal features, thresholds, and potentially build a deeper tree if the data supports it.
