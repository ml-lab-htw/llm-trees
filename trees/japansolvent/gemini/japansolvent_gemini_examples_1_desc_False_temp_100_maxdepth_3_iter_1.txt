**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

The provided features relate to financial health.  The decision tree is designed to assess solvency based on key financial ratios:

* **NI/TC (Net Income/Total Capital):** This is a primary indicator of profitability.  A positive net income suggests financial health, making it a good root node.
* **Equity/TL (Equity/Total Liabilities):** This represents a company's solvency.  A higher ratio indicates more equity to cover liabilities, which is a positive sign.
* **Sales/TA (Sales/Total Assets):** This is a measure of asset utilization efficiency. A higher ratio means the company is generating more sales per unit of assets.


The tree logic prioritizes profitability (NI/TC).  If a company is profitable, it then checks for solvency (Equity/TL).  If solvency is questionable, it then checks efficiency (Sales/TA). The assumption is a profitable company might still be solvent if it's efficiently using its assets, even if it has higher liabilities. If a company is not profitable, it is predicted to be insolvent regardless of other factors.

This decision tree is a heuristic example based on general financial principles. In a real-world scenario, a model would be trained on actual data for greater accuracy.  The choice of thresholds (0.05, 0.5, 1.0) is illustrative and would also need to be determined by data analysis.
