This function mirrors the logic of the hypothetical decision tree presented earlier.  Remember that the performance of this function heavily relies on the validity of the assumed thresholds and the relationships between these financial ratios and solvency.  Without training on real-world data, its predictive accuracy is unknown.  The `nodes` list provides a trace of the decision path taken for a given input. Each element corresponds to an inner node's condition, with 1 representing True and 0 representing False. This allows for interpretability and analysis of the decision-making process.
