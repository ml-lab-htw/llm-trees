**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Values:** I've filled in reasonable placeholder values for the thresholds based on typical financial analysis.  For instance, `Equity/TL <= 0.5` suggests a higher debt burden, while `NI/Sales <= 0.02` indicates a low-profit margin.  These are just examples, and the best thresholds would depend on the specific dataset and industry.
* **Simplified "Possibly" Cases:** I've simplified the "Possibly Solvent/Insolvent" outcomes to 0 and 1 for the prediction itself. The accompanying `nodes` list still provides the full decision path, enabling further analysis if needed. The simplification is to have the function return an integer class label (0 or 1), which corresponds to how a decision tree classifier typically predicts.
* **Node Indexing:** The `nodes` list is populated carefully to reflect the actual decision path. Since the tree is not perfectly balanced, we use nodes[2] on both branches of the first split but for different feature checks.  We return `nodes[:3]` to only include the nodes actually checked as determined by the input features.
* **Feature Usage:**  The code strictly uses the provided feature names and adheres to the specified format.


This function now provides both a prediction (0 or 1 for insolvency status) and the truth values of the inner nodes, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the decision-making process.  Remember that this is still a hypothetical tree, and a real-world application would require training on actual data.
