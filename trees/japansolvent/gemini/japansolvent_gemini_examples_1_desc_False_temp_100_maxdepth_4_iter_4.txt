Explanation and Key Improvements:

1. **Node Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized with `None` values for all potential nodes (up to the maximum possible, here we used 10,  given the maximum depth of 4 and potential for between 4 and 15 inner nodes). This ensures that even if a branch of the tree isn't used, there's a placeholder in the list.

2. **Feature Usage:** The provided financial features are used in the conditions of the inner nodes, with example thresholds. These thresholds are arbitrary and  *not* learned from data (as requested).  In a real application, these thresholds would be determined during the training process.  I've tried to select thresholds that make intuitive financial sense (e.g., higher profitability ratios likely correspond to solvency), but they are purely illustrative.

3. **Tree Structure:** The `if-else` structure represents the branches of the decision tree. It implements a depth of 4  with between 4 and 15 inner nodes using the specified features.  The structure is somewhat arbitrary as we're not training on data, but demonstrates how a deeper tree would be constructed.

4. **Return Values:** The function returns both the `prediction` (0 or 1 for insolvency/solvency) and the `nodes` list, which contains the truth values (0 or 1) for each inner node's condition. This allows you to see which path through the tree was taken.

5. **Flexibility:** The code is designed to easily adjust the conditions and thresholds or even add more nodes up to the desired depth, should you wish to experiment with different tree structures.


To use this function, you would create a dictionary representing the feature values of a company:

```python
company_data = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.07,
    "NI/TC": 0.03,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.12,
    "NI/Sales": 0.06,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 0.6,
    "Equity/TA": 0.5, 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```


This would output the prediction and the truth values for each node based on the input `company_data` and the hardcoded decision tree logic.  Remember, the accuracy of this tree would be highly dependent on appropriately chosen thresholds if used in a real application with real data.  Since the example requests no training, the thresholds are chosen arbitrarily for demonstration purposes only.
