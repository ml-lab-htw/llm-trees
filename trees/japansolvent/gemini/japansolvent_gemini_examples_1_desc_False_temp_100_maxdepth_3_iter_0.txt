**Explanation and Rationale:**

The generated decision tree uses a maximum depth of 3 and focuses on what are likely to be important financial ratios for solvency prediction.  Here's the reasoning behind the chosen features and thresholds:

* **NI/TC (Net Income/Total Capital):** This is a core profitability measure relative to the total capital employed. A low NI/TC often suggests financial distress and potential insolvency. The threshold of 0.05 is chosen as a potential indicator of low profitability.

* **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets):**  This ratio indicates the operating profitability of a company's assets.  Low EBIT/TA suggests the company may struggle to generate sufficient returns to cover its costs, increasing the risk of insolvency. The 0.02 threshold acts as a possible sign of weak operating performance.

* **Equity/TA (Equity/Total Assets):**  This represents the proportion of a company's assets financed by shareholders' equity. A low Equity/TA implies higher reliance on debt, making the company more vulnerable to financial shocks and potentially increasing insolvency risk. The threshold of 0.3 suggests a possibly risky capital structure.

The tree structure reflects a hierarchical assessment of solvency risk:

1. **Start with profitability (NI/TC):** If NI/TC is significantly low, it's a strong indicator of potential insolvency.

2. **Consider operating performance (EBIT/TA):**  If NI/TC is low, then a low EBIT/TA further increases the insolvency likelihood.

3. **Assess capital structure (Equity/TA):** If both profitability and operating performance are weak, a low Equity/TA can be the final straw, indicating a highly leveraged and potentially insolvent company.


It's crucial to remember that this decision tree is generated without training on actual data.  The chosen features, thresholds, and tree structure are based on general financial principles and assumptions.  A real-world solvency prediction model would require training on a labeled dataset to optimize its performance and accuracy.  The thresholds used here are illustrative.
