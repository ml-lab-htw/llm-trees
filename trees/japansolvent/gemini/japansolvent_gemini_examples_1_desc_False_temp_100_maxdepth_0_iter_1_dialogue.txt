This Python function mirrors the structure of the hypothetical decision tree outlined previously.  It takes a dictionary `X` of features as input, where the keys are the feature names (exactly as you specified) and the values are the feature values.  The function then evaluates the conditions at each node, storing the truth values (True/False represented as 1/0) in the `nodes` list. Finally, it returns the predicted solvency (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) along with the `nodes` list.  As before, remember that this is a hypothetical tree and the thresholds are chosen for illustrative purposes. A real-world application requires training on a dataset.
