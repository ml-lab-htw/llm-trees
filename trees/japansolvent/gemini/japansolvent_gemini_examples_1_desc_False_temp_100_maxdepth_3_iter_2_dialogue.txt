def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.20
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.00

    if nodes[0]:  # Equity/TA <= 0.20
        if nodes[1]:  # NI/TC <= 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:  # NI/TC > 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Potentially, but high risk - simplified to insolvent)
    else:  # Equity/TA > 0.20
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.00
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Likely)
        else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.00
            prediction = 1  # Solvent (Likely)

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Consistent Insolvency Prediction for Low Equity:** The original logic had a potential ambiguity where a company with low `Equity/TA` but higher `NI/TC` could be considered potentially solvent. This has been simplified to predict insolvency in both cases of low `Equity/TA`, as low equity generally indicates higher risk regardless of current profitability.
* **Clearer Thresholds:**  The code now explicitly uses the threshold values (0.20, 0.05, and 0.00) as discussed previously.
* **List Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized with the correct size (3 in this case) to avoid potential errors.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the mapping to the decision tree structure.


This improved function provides a more consistent and understandable implementation of the hypothetical solvency prediction decision tree.  Remember that this remains a simplified example, and a real-world application would require data-driven training and validation.
