    Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following financial ratios:
            - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
            - 'NI/TC': Net Income / Total Capital
            - 'Sales/TA': Sales / Total Assets
            - 'EBIT/Sales': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Sales
            - 'NI/Sales': Net Income / Sales
            - 'WC/TA': Working Capital / Total Assets
            - 'Equity/TL': Equity / Total Liabilities
            - 'Equity/TA': Equity / Total Assets

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 1 if the company is predicted to be solvent, 0 otherwise.
            - nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the company's financial ratios.

2. **Nodes Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` initializes a list called `nodes` with two elements, both set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions evaluated at each inner node of the decision tree. Since we aim for a maximum depth of 2, we will have at most two inner nodes.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:** 
   - `nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] >= 0.05`: This line represents the first decision node in the tree. It checks if the 'NI/TC' (Net Income / Total Capital) ratio is greater than or equal to 0.05. The threshold 0.05 is an example and should be determined through analysis or domain knowledge. The result of this comparison (True/False) is stored in `nodes[0]`.
   - The following `if` and `else` statements implement the branching logic of the decision tree based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.
   - The placeholder thresholds (`0.05`, `0.1`) and features (`NI/TC`, `EBIT/TA`) should be replaced with the most relevant features and optimized thresholds for predicting solvency.

4. **Prediction:**  The `prediction` variable will hold the final classification (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) based on the decision tree's evaluation.

5. **Return Values:** The function returns both the `prediction` and the `nodes` list. The `nodes` list allows you to see which branches of the decision tree were taken for a given input, providing transparency to the decision-making process.


**Important Notes:**

* **Threshold Optimization:** The chosen thresholds in this example are arbitrary and need to be optimized using a dataset and a suitable decision tree training algorithm. 
* **Feature Selection:**  While the example uses 'NI/TC' and 'EBIT/TA', the most relevant features for predicting solvency should be determined through feature importance analysis or domain expertise. 

This function provides a template for a decision tree classifier. To make it functional and accurate, you need to:

1. **Train the decision tree** on a relevant dataset to learn the optimal thresholds and feature splits.
2. **Potentially select different features** based on their importance in predicting solvency.
