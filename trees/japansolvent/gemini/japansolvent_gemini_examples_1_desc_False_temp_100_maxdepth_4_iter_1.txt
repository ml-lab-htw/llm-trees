Explanation of the Generated Code:

1. **Node Initialization:**  `nodes = 10 * [None]` creates a list to store the truth values (True/False, or 1/0) of the conditions at each decision node. We initialize it with a size slightly larger than the required minimum of 4 and less than the maximum of 15 to ensure we have enough space.

2. **Decision Nodes:** The conditions inside the `if/else` structure represent the decision nodes.  They use the provided feature names (e.g., "EBIT/TA", "NI/TC") and compare them to threshold values. These threshold values are chosen arbitrarily, as we are not training the tree on real data.  The important part is the structure and use of the feature names.

3. **Leaf Nodes (Predictions):**  The `prediction = 1` or `prediction = 0` lines represent the leaf nodes of the tree, where the final prediction (solvent/insolvent) is made.


4. **Depth and Number of Nodes:** The nested `if/else` structure creates a decision tree.  The example I've provided has a depth of 4 in some branches and fulfills the requirement of having between 4 and 15 internal nodes (the conditions within the `if/else` statements). The specific depth and number of nodes might change a little bit depending on which branch you follow down the tree. You can easily adjust the depth and the number of inner nodes in the tree by adding/removing inner if/else blocks.

5. **Return Values:** The function returns both the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, which contains the truth values (1 or 0) for each decision node encountered during the prediction process, as requested.


Important:  This code generates a *symbolic* decision tree.  It is not trained on data and will not generalize well to real-world scenarios. To build an effective decision tree, you need to train it on a dataset using a machine learning library like scikit-learn.  This example demonstrates how to programmatically create the structure of a decision tree function using given features and fulfilling the specified constraints.
