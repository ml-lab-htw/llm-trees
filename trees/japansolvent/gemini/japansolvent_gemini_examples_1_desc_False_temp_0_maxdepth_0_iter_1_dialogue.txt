```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Adjusted number of nodes

    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.20
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.00  # Using NI/TC (Net Income/Total Assets) as a proxy for ROA
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10
    nodes[3] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent (potentially stressed)
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent (requires further investigation)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  Meaningful threshold values (0.20, 0.00, 0.10, 0.05) have been added based on common financial interpretations.  These are still examples; optimal values would come from training a model on real data.
* **`NI/TC` as ROA proxy:** The original tree used `Net Income/Total Assets`. I've explicitly used this as a proxy for Return on Assets (ROA) and called it `NI/TC` in the code for clarity.
* **Simplified Structure:** The original nested `if/else` structure was simplified for readability and to more directly reflect the decision tree logic.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly tracks the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node.
* **Feature Names:** The code now uses the exact feature names provided in your prompt.



**Example Usage:**

```python
example_features = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'NI/TC': 0.02,
    'Sales/TA': 1.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.02,
    'NI/Sales': 0.01,
    'WC/TA': 0.15,
    'Equity/TL': 0.5,
    'Equity/TA': 0.3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, False, True]
```


**Key takeaway:** This function now provides a working example that adheres to your specifications.  Remember that to create a robust, accurate model, you'll need to train a decision tree algorithm on a real dataset.  This example demonstrates the structure and logic of such a function but is not a substitute for data-driven model development.
