```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.25
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.02
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05

    if nodes[0]:  # Equity/TA <= 0.25
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # Equity/TA > 0.25
        if nodes[1]:  # NI/TC <= 0.02
            if nodes[2]:  # WC/TA <= 0.05
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:  # WC/TA > 0.05
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:  # NI/TC > 0.02
            if nodes[3]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05
                prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes

```


Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided (e.g., 'Equity/TA', 'NI/TC').
* **Threshold Values:**  Includes more realistic (though still example) threshold values. These values should be learned from data in a real application.
* **Node Truth Values:**  Creates and populates the `nodes` list to store the boolean values of the decision tree's internal node conditions.  This list accurately reflects the path taken through the tree for a given input.
* **Clearer Structure:** Improved code formatting and comments make the logic easier to follow.
* **Type Hinting:** Includes type hinting (`X: dict`) for better readability and maintainability.


This function now takes a dictionary of feature values as input and returns both the predicted solvency (0 or 1) and a list representing the path through the decision tree. Remember, this decision tree is a simplified example.  A real-world model would be trained on data and likely have a more complex structure.
