```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.5  # Using Equity/TA as a likely important feature

    if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 0  # Predict insolvent if Equity/TA is low
    else:
      prediction = 1  # Predict solvent if Equity/TA is high
    return prediction, nodes
```
