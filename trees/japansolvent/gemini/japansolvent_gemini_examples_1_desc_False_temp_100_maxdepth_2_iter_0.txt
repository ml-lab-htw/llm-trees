```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.5  # Example threshold
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.02 # Example threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the generated code and choices:**

1. **Feature Selection (Equity/TA and NI/TC):**  I've chosen `Equity/TA` (Equity to Total Assets) and `NI/TC` (Net Income to Total Capital) as the features for the decision tree.  These are often strong indicators of a company's financial health. A low `Equity/TA` ratio suggests a company has a higher proportion of debt relative to its assets, which can be a risk factor for insolvency.  Similarly, a low or negative `NI/TC` indicates poor profitability.

2. **Thresholds (0.5 and 0.02):** The thresholds (0.5 for `Equity/TA` and 0.02 for `NI/TC`) are example values. In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be determined by analyzing the data and finding optimal splits to maximize the predictive accuracy of the decision tree.  Because we are asked to create the decision tree *without* training, I have included placeholder values.

3. **Tree Structure (Depth 2):** The code implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, as requested. It has two inner nodes (the conditions based on `Equity/TA` and `NI/TC`) and three leaf nodes (the final predictions).

4. **Predictions (0 and 1):** The leaf nodes return predictions of 0 (insolvent) or 1 (solvent) based on the path taken through the tree.

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 for true, 0 for false) of the conditions at each inner node.  This is returned alongside the prediction to provide insights into the decision-making process of the tree.



**Important Note:**  This decision tree is created without any training data.  Its predictive performance would likely be poor in a real-world application. To build an effective decision tree, you would need to train it on a labeled dataset using a suitable algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) to determine the optimal features, thresholds, and tree structure.  The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the structure of a decision tree function as requested, not to provide a production-ready model.
