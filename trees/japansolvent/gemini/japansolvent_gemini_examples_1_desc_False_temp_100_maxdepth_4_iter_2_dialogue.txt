**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Thresholds:**  Realistic threshold values are used based on general financial analysis principles.  For example, `Equity/TA <= 0.2` reflects a company with a high debt-to-equity ratio.
* **Marginal Solvency:**  Introduces the concept of "Solvent (Marginal)" to acknowledge situations where a company might be technically solvent but showing warning signs.
* **Depth Management:** While the prompt mentions a maximum depth of 4, the previous hypothetical tree implied a slightly deeper structure in some branches. This version refactors and simplifies the logic to consistently maintain a maximum depth of 4, making the tree slightly more balanced and reducing the risk of overfitting with limited data.  The `Sales/TA` split now occurs directly after the `EBIT/TA` split in the `else` branch, streamlining the decision process.
* **Simplified Conditions:** The conditions for solvency in the second main branch (where `Equity/TA > 0.2` and `EBIT/TA > 0.0`) are now simplified.  A company with positive equity and positive EBIT is considered solvent, even with very high sales turnover (which might warrant further investigation, but doesn't immediately imply insolvency).




This function fulfills the requirements and provides a more refined and practically applicable decision tree structure compared to the initial hypothetical example. Remember, to build a truly effective model, you'll need to train it on real-world data. This example provides a strong starting point based on financial principles.
