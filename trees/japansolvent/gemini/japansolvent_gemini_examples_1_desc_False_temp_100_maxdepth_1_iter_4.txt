```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.5  # Example threshold - no data used

    if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 1 # Assume higher Equity/TA means solvent
    else:
      prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

Since no training data is provided, and we're asked to build a decision tree of maximum depth 1, we choose a single feature and a threshold to split on.  "Equity/TA" (Equity/Total Assets) seems like a reasonable feature to use for predicting solvency.  A company with a higher proportion of equity relative to its total assets is generally considered more financially stable.

The threshold of 0.5 is arbitrary in this case, as we're not using any data to optimize it.  In a real-world scenario, you'd determine the best threshold (and the best feature) using a training dataset and a suitable splitting criterion (like Gini impurity or information gain).

The function returns both the predicted value (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list `nodes` which represents the path taken through the decision tree. In this case, `nodes[0]` stores the truth value of the comparison  `X["Equity/TA"] > 0.5`. This list is helpful for understanding the decision-making process of the tree, especially with deeper trees.
