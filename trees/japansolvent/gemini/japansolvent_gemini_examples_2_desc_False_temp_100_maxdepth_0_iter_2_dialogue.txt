**Explanation of Threshold Selection:**

* **Profitability:**
    * `nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] > 0.05`:  Positive net income relative to total capital is a strong indicator of solvency.
    * `nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.02`: A positive EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) in relation to assets suggests the company is generating operating profits.
    * `nodes[5] = X['EBIT/Sales'] > 0.1`:  A higher EBIT/Sales margin generally means better profitability and efficiency.

* **Liquidity & Efficiency:**
    * `nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.15`:  A healthy working capital ratio indicates the company can meet its short-term obligations.
    * `nodes[4] = X['Sales/TA'] > 0.8`:  This threshold assesses asset utilizationâ€”higher values might indicate the company is using its assets effectively to generate sales.

* **Financial Leverage:**
    * `nodes[3] = X['Equity/TA'] > 0.3`: A higher equity-to-assets ratio suggests the company relies less on debt financing, potentially indicating lower financial risk.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data-Driven:** The chosen thresholds are illustrative. The optimal values will depend heavily on the specific dataset used for training the decision tree.
* **Overfitting:** This decision tree is relatively simple to avoid overfitting. With more data, you could create a more complex tree, but be cautious of overfitting to the training data.
* **Evaluation:**  Always evaluate the performance of the decision tree on a separate test dataset to estimate its real-world performance.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Consider exploring additional financial ratios and feature engineering techniques to potentially improve the model's accuracy.
