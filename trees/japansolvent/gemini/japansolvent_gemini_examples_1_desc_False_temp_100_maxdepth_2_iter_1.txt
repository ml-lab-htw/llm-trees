```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TL"] > 0.5  # Example threshold
    nodes[1] = X["NI/Sales"] > 0.05 # Example threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Insolvent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification:**

The task is to create a decision tree *without training*, using only the provided feature names, and with a maximum depth of 2.  This means we need to make reasonable assumptions about which features might be important and what thresholds might be useful for splitting.

For predicting company solvency, I've chosen `Equity/TL` (Equity/Total Liabilities) and `NI/Sales` (Net Income/Sales) as potentially important features.

* **`Equity/TL`**:  A higher equity-to-liabilities ratio generally indicates a stronger financial position and a lower risk of insolvency.  A threshold of 0.5 (meaning equity is greater than half of total liabilities) is a plausible starting point, though in a real-world scenario, this would need to be determined based on data analysis.

* **`NI/Sales`**:  Net Income as a percentage of sales (profit margin) is a key indicator of profitability.  A positive net income is generally good, and a higher margin is better.  A threshold of 0.05 (5% profit margin) is used as an example. Again, this would need to be validated with data.

The logic of the tree is:

1. **Check `Equity/TL`:** If it's greater than 0.5, the company is more likely to be solvent.  We move to the next level of the tree.
2. **Check `NI/Sales`:** If it's also greater than 0.05, the company is even more likely to be solvent, so we predict 1 (solvent). Otherwise, even with good equity/liabilities, low profitability might suggest problems, leading to a prediction of 0 (insolvent).
3. **If `Equity/TL` is not greater than 0.5:**  This indicates a potentially weaker financial position, so we predict 0 (insolvent) regardless of the profit margin.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training:** The provided solution is a *demonstration* of how to structure a decision tree function. It is NOT based on any real-world data or training.
* **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds (0.5 for `Equity/TL` and 0.05 for `NI/Sales`) are arbitrary examples. In a real application, you would determine these thresholds through data analysis and model training.
* **Feature Selection:** The selection of `Equity/TL` and `NI/Sales` is also based on general financial principles, not data. A real-world model might use different features or combinations of features.
* **Depth 2:** The tree is structured to have a maximum depth of 2, as specified in the prompt.


This Python function fulfills the requirements: it takes a dictionary of features as input, uses the specified feature names, creates a decision tree of depth 2 with plausible (but not data-driven) thresholds, and returns the prediction along with a list of the truth values of the inner nodes. Remember that to use this effectively, you'd need to train a real decision tree on a relevant dataset to determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure.
