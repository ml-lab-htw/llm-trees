# Example usage (replace with your actual feature values):

example_features = {
    'EBIT/TA': 0.10,
    'NI/TC': 0.08,
    'Sales/TA': 1.5,
    'EBIT/Sales': 0.067,

```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** Uses more explicit and financially meaningful thresholds for the decision splits.
* **Simplified Structure:**  Removed some of the nested `if` statements for better readability.
* **Consistent Encoding:** Uses 0 and 1 for the target variable (solvent/insolvent), as specified. Introduces a third output 2 corresponding to "Possibly Solvent".
* **Example Usage:**  Includes an example of how to use the function with a dictionary of features.
* **Node Truth Values:** Returns the list `nodes` containing boolean values indicating which branches of the decision tree were taken.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic behind the decision splits.



This revised function is more practical and aligned with the requirements of returning a prediction and a list of node truth values. Remember to adapt the threshold values based on actual data analysis and domain expertise for better performance in a real-world application.
