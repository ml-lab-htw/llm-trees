I understand you want a Python function that predicts company solvency based on a decision tree, along with a list reflecting the truth values of the inner nodes. However, you haven't provided me with a decision tree structure. The examples you provided use features like 'petal_length' and 'sepal_width', which are irrelevant to predicting company solvency.

To create the function you need, I need the decision tree's structure. This means knowing:

1. **Which feature is used at each decision node?**  
2. **What are the threshold values for each feature split?**
3. **What is the predicted class (solvent or insolvent) at each leaf node?**

**Once you provide the decision tree structure, I can translate it into a Python function like the examples you gave.**  

**Example Decision Tree Structure (Illustrative):**

Let's say your decision tree looks like this (this is just an example, you need to provide your actual tree):

```
If 'EBIT/TA' > 0.05:
    If 'NI/Sales' > 0.10:
        Prediction: Solvent (1)
    Else:
        Prediction: Insolvent (0)
Else:
    If 'Equity/TL' > 1.5:
        Prediction: Solvent (1)
    Else: 
        Prediction: Insolvent (0) 
```

**Python Function based on the example tree:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.05  
    nodes[1] = X['NI/Sales'] > 0.10 
    nodes[2] = X['Equity/TL'] > 1.5  

    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # NI/Sales > 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        if nodes[2]:  # Equity/TL > 1.5
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Please provide the decision tree structure, and I'll generate the Python function for you.**
