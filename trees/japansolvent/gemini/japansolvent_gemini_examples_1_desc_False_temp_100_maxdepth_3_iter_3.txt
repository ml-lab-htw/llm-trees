```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05  # Example threshold
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02 # Example threshold
    nodes[2] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.5 # Example threshold

    if nodes[0]:  # Low NI/TC
        prediction = 0 # Likely insolvent
    else: # Higher NI/TC
        if nodes[1]: # Low EBIT/TA despite decent NI/TC (potentially unsustainable)
            if nodes[2]: # Low Equity/TA
                prediction = 0 # Insolvent
            else: # Higher Equity/TA
                prediction = 1 # Solvent, may recover
        else: # Higher EBIT/TA and higher NI/TC
            prediction = 1 # Solvent
    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Reasoning for Tree Structure:**

The provided features are financial ratios, commonly used to assess a company's financial health and predict solvency. The decision tree logic is built around these ratios using reasonable assumptions:

* **NI/TC (Net Income/Total Capital):**  A primary indicator of profitability and return on investment. Low or negative NI/TC often suggests financial distress and potential insolvency.  This is chosen as the root node because overall profitability is crucial.
* **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets):**  Measures operating efficiency and how effectively a company generates profits from its assets. If NI/TC is decent but EBIT/TA is low, it could indicate issues with debt servicing or other non-operating expenses, making long-term solvency questionable.
* **Equity/TA (Equity/Total Assets):** Represents the proportion of a company's assets owned by shareholders. A low Equity/TA signifies a high level of debt and increased financial risk. This is a good tie-breaker when NI/TC and EBIT/TA might give conflicting signals.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds used (0.05, 0.02, 0.5) are examples. In a real-world scenario, these would be determined by data analysis and potentially optimized through a training process.
* **Maximum Depth:** The tree has a depth of 3, adhering to the requirement. This means there are at most 7 inner nodes (this example has 3).
* **No Training:** The tree is induced based on financial logic, not trained on data.  Therefore, its accuracy is heavily dependent on the validity of the assumptions about these ratios' relationships with solvency.
* **Feature Importance:**  The features selected are considered important in solvency prediction based on common financial analysis principles.



This example fulfills the prompt requirements: a Python function predicting solvency based on the specified features, employing a decision tree structure with a maximum depth of 3, and returning the prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Remember that without training, the performance of this tree is unknown and likely suboptimal.  Real-world applications would involve training on a dataset to optimize thresholds and potentially the tree structure itself.
