This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree structure outlined in the previous response.  It checks the feature values provided in the input dictionary `X` and makes a prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent) based on the thresholds.  It also records the truth values of the conditions in the `nodes` list. For example, if `X['Equity/TA']` is less than or equal to 0.20, then `nodes[0]` will be `True` (or 1 in numerical terms), otherwise it will be `False` (or 0). This allows for tracking which branches of the decision tree were taken.


Remember, this function is a simplified example and hasn't been trained on real data.  The thresholds (0.20, 0.05, and 0.10) are reasonable estimates based on general financial principles but would need to be adjusted based on real-world data in a true application. Using a machine learning library like scikit-learn is essential for building robust and accurate decision tree models from data.
