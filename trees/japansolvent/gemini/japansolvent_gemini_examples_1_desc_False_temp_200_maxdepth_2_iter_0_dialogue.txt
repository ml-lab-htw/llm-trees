**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Usage:** The function now uses `X['Equity/TA']` and `X['NI/TC']` (calculated as `X['NI/TC'] * X['TC/TA']` if you have Total Capital/Total Assets, otherwise a reasonable proxy would be needed) as the primary and secondary decision features, respectively.  The keys match the provided feature list.
* **Thresholds:** The thresholds of 0.20 for `Equity/TA` and 0.05 for `NI/TC` remain as illustrative examples.  In a real-world scenario, these thresholds should be determined through data analysis and model training.
* **Borderline Cases:** The borderline cases (where `Equity/TA` > 0.20 but `NI/TC` <= 0.05) are now explicitly classified as potentially insolvent (prediction 0) in this simplified model.  A more complex model might have a separate "borderline" class or use more features to refine the prediction.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) for the conditions at each inner node.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability and includes a docstring explaining the function's purpose.

This revised function provides a more accurate and robust implementation of the decision tree, adhering to the specified requirements and incorporating best practices for clarity and maintainability.  Remember that the accuracy and effectiveness of this model would significantly improve with real-world data and appropriate training.
