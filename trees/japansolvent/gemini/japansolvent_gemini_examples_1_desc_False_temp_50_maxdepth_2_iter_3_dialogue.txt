**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Using `nodes` instead of less descriptive names improves readability.
* **Explicit Thresholds:**  The thresholds (0.20 and 0.05) are now included directly in the code, making the logic more transparent and easier to adjust.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic at each decision point, referencing the specific financial ratios being used.
* **Consistent Return Type:** The function consistently returns a tuple containing both the prediction and the list of node truth values.
* **Type Hinting:**  Included type hinting (`X: dict`) to clarify the expected input type.
* **Docstring:** A docstring is added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value, following good coding practices.

This revised function is more readable, maintainable, and better aligned with software engineering best practices. It also demonstrates the decision tree logic more clearly. Remember, to use this effectively, you should train a real decision tree model with a substantial dataset to determine the best features and thresholds for your specific use case.  This example is a simplified illustration.
