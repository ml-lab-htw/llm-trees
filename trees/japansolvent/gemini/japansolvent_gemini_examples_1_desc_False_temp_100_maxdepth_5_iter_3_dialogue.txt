This function takes a dictionary `X` representing the features of a company and returns the predicted solvency (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) and a list `nodes` containing the truth values (1 or 0) for each decision node in the tree.  The thresholds are filled in with reasonable values based on general financial analysis principles, as requested.  This function represents the decision tree structure outlined in the previous responses, translated into executable Python code. Remember, this function is based on a hypothetical tree and hasn't been trained on actual data. Using it on real data will likely require adjustments to the thresholds and possibly the tree structure itself.
