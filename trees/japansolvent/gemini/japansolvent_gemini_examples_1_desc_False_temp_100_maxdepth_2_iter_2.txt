```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["NI/TC"] > 0.02  # Example threshold - adjust as needed
    nodes[1] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.3 # Example threshold - adjust as needed
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely solvent if both conditions met
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Potentially insolvent even with positive NI/TC
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Likely insolvent if NI/TC is low

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification:**

The provided features relate to financial health. I've chosen `NI/TC` (Net Income/Total Capital) and `Equity/TA` (Equity/Total Assets) as the top two features for a hypothetical decision tree of depth 2 to predict solvency.

* **NI/TC:**  A positive net income relative to total capital is a strong indicator of profitability and financial health. A company losing money (negative NI/TC) is much more likely to be insolvent.
* **Equity/TA:** This ratio represents the proportion of a company's assets owned by shareholders. A higher equity-to-assets ratio generally suggests a stronger financial position and lower risk of insolvency.  A low Equity/TA might indicate high debt levels, a risk factor for insolvency.

**Thresholds:**

The thresholds (0.02 for NI/TC and 0.3 for Equity/TA) are example values.  In a real-world scenario, you would determine optimal thresholds using statistical analysis or domain expertise. These thresholds would be tuned based on the specific dataset and business context.

**Logic:**

The decision tree logic follows this structure:

1. **Is NI/TC > 0.02?**
   - **Yes:**  Check Equity/TA.
      - **Is Equity/TA > 0.3?**
         - **Yes:** Predict solvent (1).
         - **No:** Predict insolvent (0) - even with some profits, low equity is risky.
   - **No:** Predict insolvent (0) - low or negative net income is a strong indicator of problems.



**Important Notes:**

* **No Training:** This code generates a *hypothetical* decision tree structure.  It is NOT trained on any data.  The feature selection, thresholds, and even the chosen features themselves would be different after training on real data.
* **Feature Importance:**  In a true machine learning scenario, feature importance is determined by the algorithm during training. Here, I've made educated guesses about which features would likely be important for solvency prediction.
* **Depth 2:**  The code implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 as requested, meaning it has at most two levels of decision nodes below the root.
* **Python Function Format:** The code adheres to the requested format, returning both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the decision nodes.


This example provides a conceptual framework.  To create a robust and accurate decision tree classifier, you must train it on relevant data using a machine learning library like scikit-learn.  This training process will automatically determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure to maximize predictive accuracy.
