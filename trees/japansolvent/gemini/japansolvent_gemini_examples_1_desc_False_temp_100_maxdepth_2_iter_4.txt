```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["NI/TC"] <= 0.05

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely insolvent if both low equity and low net income
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Possibly solvent with low equity but positive net income
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Likely solvent with high equity

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Reasoning for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

In the absence of actual data and training, the choices made here are based on general financial principles:

* **Equity/TA (Equity to Total Assets):** A low equity-to-assets ratio generally suggests higher financial risk. Companies with lower equity are more reliant on debt financing and may be more vulnerable to insolvency. A threshold of 0.5 (50%) is a reasonable starting point, as companies with less equity than assets are generally considered more risky.
* **NI/TC (Net Income to Total Capital):**  Profitability is a strong indicator of solvency.  Net income relative to total capital provides a measure of return on investment.  A low or negative NI/TC suggests poor performance and potentially a higher risk of insolvency.  A threshold of 0.05 (5%) is used as a placeholder;  realistically, this threshold could vary significantly based on the industry.

**Tree Structure and Predictions:**

The tree structure attempts to capture the following logic:

1. **High Equity/TA:**  Companies with a high equity-to-assets ratio are more likely to be solvent, regardless of their net income, at least to a first approximation.  Therefore, if `Equity/TA > 0.5`, the prediction is solvency (1).

2. **Low Equity/TA:** If `Equity/TA <= 0.5`, the tree considers net income:
    * **Low NI/TC:** If `NI/TC <= 0.05`, the company is likely to be insolvent (0) due to both low equity and weak profitability.
    * **High NI/TC:** If `NI/TC > 0.05`,  the company might still be solvent (1), despite low equity, if its profitability is relatively strong. This indicates they might be managing debt well and generating positive returns.


It's crucial to understand that this decision tree is built without training data and based on simplified assumptions.  In a real-world application, training a decision tree on a representative dataset and using appropriate evaluation metrics is essential for building a reliable and accurate model.  The thresholds and chosen features would also need to be validated using statistical methods and domain expertise.
