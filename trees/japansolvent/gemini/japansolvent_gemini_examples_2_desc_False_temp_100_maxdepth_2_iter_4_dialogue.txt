**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial ratios as input.
2. **Nodes List:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` initializes a list with two elements (for a depth of 2), representing the truth values of the decision nodes. 
3. **Decision Logic:**
   - `nodes[0] = X['NI/TC'] >= 0.05`: This is an **example** decision node. It checks if the Net Income/Total Assets ratio is greater than or equal to 0.05. You'll need to replace this with a meaningful threshold based on your analysis.
   - `nodes[1] = X['Equity/TL'] >= 1.5`: This is another **example** decision node checking if Equity/Total Liabilities is greater than or equal to 1.5. Again, replace with an appropriate threshold.
4. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision tree logic based on the truth values in the `nodes` list. 
   - The `prediction` is set to 1 (solvent) or 0 (insolvent) based on the combination of decision node outcomes.

**Important Notes:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** The provided code uses example thresholds (0.05 and 1.5) and features (NI/TC and Equity/TL) for demonstration purposes. You **must** replace these with thresholds and features you determine to be most important for predicting solvency based on your data and domain knowledge.
* **Feature Importance:**  You haven't specified how you want to determine feature importance. You can use techniques like information gain, Gini impurity, or feature importance scores from tree-based models during training to identify the most relevant features.

This code provides the structure for your decision tree function. Remember to analyze your data, determine the most important features and appropriate thresholds, and then replace the placeholders with your findings to create an accurate and meaningful solvency prediction model.
