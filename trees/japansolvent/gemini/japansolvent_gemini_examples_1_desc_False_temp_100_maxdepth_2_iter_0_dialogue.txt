def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.1  # Threshold1: 0.1 (low working capital suggests potential insolvency)
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.05  # Threshold2: 0.05 (low return on capital suggests insolvency)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent if working capital is low
    else:  # Working capital is healthy
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent if return on capital is also low
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent if both working capital and return on capital are healthy

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* **`WC/TA <= 0.1`:** A working capital ratio of 0.1 or less is often a red flag.  It indicates that for every dollar of current assets, the company has a high amount of current liabilities, potentially signaling difficulty meeting short-term obligations.

* **`NI/TC <= 0.05`:**  A return on capital of 5% or less might be considered low, especially depending on the industry. It suggests the company isn't generating strong profits relative to the capital invested.

These threshold values are for illustrative purposes only. In a real-world scenario, these would be learned from data using a machine learning algorithm.  Different industries and economic conditions will necessitate different threshold values.  The chosen features and structure also assume relationships between these ratios and solvency. A thorough analysis with real data is always required for accurate prediction.
