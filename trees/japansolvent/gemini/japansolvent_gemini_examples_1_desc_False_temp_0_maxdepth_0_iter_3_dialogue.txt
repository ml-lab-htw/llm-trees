```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Thresholds determined based on general financial principles.
    # These would be optimized with real data and a training process.
    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.20
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.00
    nodes[3] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.10


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Low Equity/TA)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Low NI/TC)
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                 prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Negative WC/TA)
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Low EBIT/TA)
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Solvent (Healthy ratios)

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable placeholder threshold values based on general financial analysis principles.  Remember, these are just examples.  With a real dataset, you'd train a decision tree algorithm (like CART, ID3, or scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`) to learn optimal thresholds.

2. **Feature Usage:** The function directly uses the provided feature keys (e.g., 'Equity/TA', 'NI/TC').

3. **Target Encoding:** The function returns 1 for "solvent" and 0 for "insolvent," matching the provided target encoding.

4. **Simplified Structure:** The nested `if` statements follow the logic of the decision tree described earlier, making the code cleaner and more efficient.

5. **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) of each decision node's condition, as requested.



**How to use with a real dataset and scikit-learn:**

1. **Data Preparation:** Load your data into a pandas DataFrame, separating features (X) and the target variable (y).

2. **Train the Decision Tree:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()  # You can adjust parameters like max_depth
   clf.fit(X, y) 
   ```

3. **Predict:**
   ```python
   new_company_data = {'EBIT/TA': 0.15, 'NI/TC': 0.08, 'Sales/TA': 1.2, 'EBIT/Sales': 0.12, 'NI/Sales': 0.06, 'WC/TA': 0.1, 'Equity/TL': 0.5, 'Equity/TA': 0.3}
   prediction = clf.predict([list(new_company_data.values())])[0] # scikit-learn requires list of values
   ```

This approach uses scikit-learn's powerful `DecisionTreeClassifier` to build the tree from data, automatically determining optimal thresholds and feature splits.  The provided function then serves as a blueprint for understanding the basic structure of a decision tree and how predictions are made based on feature values.  The `nodes` list can help visualize which branches of the tree are taken for a given input.
