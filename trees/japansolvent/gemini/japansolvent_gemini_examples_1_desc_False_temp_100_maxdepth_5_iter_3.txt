This decision tree uses a series of financial ratios to assess the solvency of a company. It prioritizes profitability (EBIT/TA, NI/TC) and then considers sales efficiency (Sales/TA), capitalization (Equity/TA), and liquidity (WC/TA).  The thresholds chosen (0.05, 0.02, 1.5, 0.5, 0.1) are illustrative and could be adjusted based on domain knowledge or further analysis.  The tree structure ensures that highly profitable and well-capitalized companies are classified as solvent, while unprofitable companies are generally classified as insolvent unless they show signs of potential turnaround (high Sales/TA despite low profits).  The depth of 5 is utilized to create a reasonably complex but interpretable decision process.


Remember that this decision tree is generated without training on real data. It's a demonstration of how to construct the function and the logic within a decision tree based on feature interpretations. To create a more accurate and robust model, you would need to train a decision tree classifier on a labeled dataset of company financials.
