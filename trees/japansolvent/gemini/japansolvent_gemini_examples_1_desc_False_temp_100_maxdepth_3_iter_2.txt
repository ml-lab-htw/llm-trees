**Explanation of the Decision Tree Logic:**

This decision tree uses financial ratios to assess solvency. The key idea is that profitable companies with efficient asset utilization are more likely to be solvent.

1. **NI/TC (Net Income/Total Capital):**  This is a measure of overall profitability relative to the capital invested. A value above 5% is considered a positive indicator of solvency.

2. **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets):** This measures the operating profitability of a company's assets, before considering the effects of financing and taxes. A value above 10% suggests a reasonable level of operating efficiency.

3. **Sales/TA (Sales/Total Assets):** This ratio indicates how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. A value above 1.5 generally suggests good asset utilization.

The tree follows this logic:

* **If NI/TC > 0.05:** The company is profitable overall, suggesting solvency.  
* **Else (NI/TC <= 0.05):**  The company is not making a net profit. We need further investigation.
    * **If EBIT/TA > 0.1:** The company is operating profitably, even if the bottom line (NI) is negative.  This could be due to high interest expenses or taxes. We look at sales efficiency next.
        * **If Sales/TA > 1.5:**  The company has high sales efficiency, which improves the likelihood of solvency despite low NI/TC.
        * **Else (Sales/TA <= 1.5):** The company has low sales efficiency combined with low NI/TC, which is a stronger indicator of insolvency.
    * **Else (EBIT/TA <= 0.1):** The company is not operating profitably, making insolvency more likely.


This is a simplified example, and a real-world solvency prediction model would likely involve more features and a more complex decision tree (or other machine learning algorithms). This demonstrates the basic principles of how a decision tree can be designed using domain knowledge.
