This function mirrors the decision tree logic previously outlined, now structured as a Python function that takes a dictionary of feature values (X) as input and returns the predicted solvency (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent) along with a list representing the path taken through the tree.  The threshold values used are still illustrative and would need adjustment based on real-world data.  Remember to evaluate the performance of any such model thoroughly.
