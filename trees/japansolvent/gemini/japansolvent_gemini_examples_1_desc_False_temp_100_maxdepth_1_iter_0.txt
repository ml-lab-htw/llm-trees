```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > 0.5  # Example threshold, could be any feature and threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Assuming higher Equity/TA suggests solvency
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```
