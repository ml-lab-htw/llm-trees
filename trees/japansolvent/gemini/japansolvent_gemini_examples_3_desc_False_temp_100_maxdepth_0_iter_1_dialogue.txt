Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I previously described, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for company solvency:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X['NI/TC'] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.30
    nodes[4] = X['Sales/TA'] <= 0.80

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Insolvent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else node for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the company's financial ratios as input. It then evaluates the decision tree nodes and returns two things:

1. The prediction: 1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent.
2. A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each element is 1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 if not satisfied, or None if the node wasn't evaluated.

The thresholds used in this function are based on common financial benchmarks and the structure of the decision tree I described earlier. However, these thresholds should ideally be fine-tuned based on actual historical data for optimal performance.
