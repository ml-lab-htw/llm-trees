Key improvements in this code:

* **Clearer Node Handling:**  The `nodes` list is initialized appropriately and only the relevant nodes are returned. This is more robust and avoids potential issues with unused `None` values.
* **Explicit Comments:**  Added comments to explain the decision logic and the expected output for the example usage.
* **Corrected Example Data and Expected Output:** Updated the example data and expected predictions to align with the decision tree logic.
* **More Robust Return:** Returning a slice `nodes[:3]` ensures only the actually used node truth values are returned.  This would be particularly useful for deeper trees where some branches might not be evaluated.

This revised version addresses the previous ambiguities and provides a more functional and understandable solution. It is now easier to use, understand, and adapt to different datasets.
