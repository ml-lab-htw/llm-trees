**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure (without data):**

Since I don't have access to data to train the tree, I'm using heuristic reasoning based on the feature names and general business knowledge.

* **Equity/TA (Equity/Total Assets):** This ratio is a strong indicator of financial health. A low Equity/TA suggests a higher proportion of debt financing, which increases the risk of insolvency. Therefore, it's chosen as the root node.  A threshold of 0.5 is used as a reasonable dividing point; lower values suggest higher risk.
* **NI/TC (Net Income/Total Capital):**  Net income (profitability) relative to the total capital employed is another crucial indicator.  Low or negative NI/TC suggests poor profitability, which increases the risk of insolvency.  This is chosen as the second level split. A threshold of 0.05 is chosen, assuming that positive but low profitability might still be indicative of a struggling company.

The tree structure chosen prioritizes these two key financial ratios as the most important indicators of solvency, with the intuition that higher values generally suggest better financial health.

**Important Note:** This generated tree is based solely on the feature names and general financial knowledge.  Its performance without training on actual data is unknown and likely to be suboptimal. To improve the tree's accuracy, training it with a real dataset is necessary to discover the optimal splits and feature importance.
