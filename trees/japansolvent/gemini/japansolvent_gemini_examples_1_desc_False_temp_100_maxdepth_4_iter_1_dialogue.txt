    nodes[0] = X['Equity/TA'] <= 0.20

                prediction = 0  # Insolvent (Low NI/TC and low WC/TA)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Possibly Solvent (Low NI/TC, but acceptable WC/TA)
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Possibly Solvent (Good NI/TC, but low EBIT/TA)

    return prediction, nodes

This Python function represents the previously described hypothetical decision tree. It takes a dictionary `X` of feature values as input and returns the prediction (0 for insolvent, 1 for solvent or possibly solvent) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values at each decision node.  The function follows the logic of the decision tree, using the specified thresholds for each feature.  Remember, this is a hypothetical tree.  A real-world tree needs to be trained on a dataset to determine the optimal thresholds and feature splits.
