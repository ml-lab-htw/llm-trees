**Explanation:**

The function implements a decision tree with the following logic:

1. **Root Node (nodes[0]):** Checks if the 'EBIT/TA' ratio is greater than 0.05. This is a common indicator of profitability.
    - If **True**, the company is more likely to be solvent and the tree branches to the right.
    - If **False**, the company might be at risk, and the tree branches to the left.

2. **Node 2 (nodes[1]):**  If 'EBIT/TA' is high, this node checks for 'NI/TC' (Net Income/Total Capital) being greater than 0.1.
    - If **True**, the company shows good profitability and efficient capital use, making it likely solvent.
    - If **False**, further analysis is needed based on working capital.

3. **Node 3 (nodes[2]):** If 'EBIT/TA' is high but 'NI/TC' is low, this node checks 'WC/TA' (Working Capital/Total Assets) to see if the company has enough short-term assets to cover its liabilities.
    - If **True**, the company might still be solvent due to a healthy working capital position.
    - If **False**, the company is likely insolvent despite high 'EBIT/TA' due to poor 'NI/TC' and 'WC/TA'. 

4. **Node 4 (nodes[3]):**  If 'EBIT/TA' is low, this node checks for a strong equity position ('Equity/TL' > 1.0).
    - If **True**, the company might still be solvent because it has a strong financial cushion (more assets than liabilities). 
    - If **False**, the company is likely insolvent due to low profitability and weak equity.

**Important Notes:**

* **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 1.0) are examples and should be adjusted based on industry benchmarks and expert knowledge.
* **Data-Driven:**  This is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would train the decision tree on a labeled dataset of company financials and solvency status to determine the most relevant features and optimal thresholds automatically. 
* **Model Complexity:** This is a basic decision tree. More complex models might be needed to capture more intricate relationships within the data.
