    Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following financial ratios:
            'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Taxes / Total Assets
            'NI/TC': Net Income / Total Capital
            'Sales/TA': Sales / Total Assets

            'Equity/TA': Equity / Total Assets

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted solvency (1 for solvent, 0 for insolvent).
            - nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Explanation:**

This decision tree uses a maximum depth of 2 and selects 'NI/TC' and 'WC/TA' as the most important features for predicting solvency. Here's the logic:

* **Node 0 (Root):**  Checks if 'NI/TC' (Net Income / Total Capital) is greater than or equal to 0.05. A higher NI/TC indicates profitability and efficient capital utilization, making solvency more likely.
* **Node 1 (Left Child):** If 'NI/TC' is high, this node checks if 'WC/TA' (Working Capital / Total Assets) is greater than or equal to 0.15. A higher WC/TA indicates better short-term liquidity, which is crucial for meeting financial obligations. If both conditions are met, the company is classified as solvent.
* **Otherwise:** If either 'NI/TC' is low or 'WC/TA' is low despite high 'NI/TC', the company is classified as insolvent.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example, and the optimal thresholds and feature choices will depend on your specific dataset and business context. You should train and evaluate this model using real data to determine its effectiveness and potentially adjust thresholds or features for better performance.
