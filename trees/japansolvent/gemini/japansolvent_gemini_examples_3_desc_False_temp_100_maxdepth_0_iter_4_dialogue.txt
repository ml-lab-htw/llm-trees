I understand. You want a Python function representing a decision tree classifier that predicts company solvency based on financial ratios, and you want the function to also output the truth values of the inner nodes. 

However, I cannot provide you with a decision tree with filled-in thresholds without any data. The process of determining which features and thresholds are most important for classifying solvency requires training a model on a dataset of companies with known solvency outcomes. 

**Here's a template for the function you requested, with placeholders for the thresholds:**

```python
def predict_solvency(X: dict):
    """Predicts company solvency based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the company's financial ratios.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) 
            - prediction (int): 1 if solvent, 0 if insolvent
            - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Adjust the number of nodes as needed

    # Example decision nodes - REPLACE THESE with meaningful conditions
    # and thresholds based on your data analysis. 
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] > 0.05  # Example: EBIT/TA greater than 5%
    nodes[1] = X['NI/TC'] > 0.10    # Example: NI/TC greater than 10%
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] > 0.20    # Example: WC/TA greater than 20% 

    # Example prediction logic (adjust based on your tree structure)
    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Solvent
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Insolvent

    return prediction, nodes 

```

**To complete this function and make it useful:**

1. **Provide the Dataset:** I need a labeled dataset of companies, their financial ratios, and their solvency status (solvent or insolvent).
2. **Train the Decision Tree:** I can use the provided dataset to train a decision tree model. This will determine the most important features and the optimal thresholds for each split in the tree. 

Once I have the trained decision tree, I can generate the Python code for you, with the appropriate features, thresholds, and prediction logic, similar to the examples you provided.
