```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree
    threshold = 0.5  # Reasonable threshold for Equity/TA.  Ideally learned from data.
    nodes[0] = X["Equity/TA"] > threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Solvent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Insolvent

    return prediction, nodes

```
