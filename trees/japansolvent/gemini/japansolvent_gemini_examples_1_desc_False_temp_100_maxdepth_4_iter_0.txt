Explanation and Design Choices:

1. **Maximum Depth of 4:** The provided example wasn't strictly depth 4 (it had nested conditions leading to a deeper effective depth). I've structured this tree to ensure no branch goes beyond a depth of 4.

2. **Feature Selection (Implied Importance):** Since there's no training data, I've selected features and thresholds heuristically based on what might seem financially relevant for solvency. For example:
   - `EBIT/TA`, `NI/TC`, `EBIT/Sales`, `NI/Sales`:  Profitability ratios. Higher values generally suggest better financial health and solvency.
   - `Sales/TA`: Asset turnover. Higher values could indicate efficient asset utilization.
   - `WC/TA`: Liquidity. Sufficient working capital is crucial for short-term obligations.
   - `Equity/TL`, `Equity/TA`: Capital structure/Leverage. Higher equity proportions suggest lower risk and better solvency.

3. **Thresholds:** The thresholds (e.g., 0.05, 0.02, 1.2) are completely arbitrary in this example.  With real data, these thresholds would be learned during the training process.

4. **Tree Structure:**  The tree structure itself is also arbitrary. A real decision tree algorithm would create the structure based on maximizing information gain or minimizing impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) on training data.

5. **List of Truth Values (nodes):** The `nodes` list stores the boolean (True/False) results of each comparison at the decision nodes.  This fulfills the requirement of having a list representing the path taken through the tree.

6. **Python Function Format:** The code is formatted as a Python function that takes a dictionary `X` of features as input and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list.

To use this function:

```python
example_input = {
    "EBIT/TA": 0.10,
    "NI/TC": 0.03,
    "Sales/TA": 1.5,
    "EBIT/Sales": 0.08,
    "NI/Sales": 0.02,
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "Equity/TL": 0.7,
    "Equity/TA": 0.5,
    "Sales/TA": 1.9,
    "WC/TA": 0.35

}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```
