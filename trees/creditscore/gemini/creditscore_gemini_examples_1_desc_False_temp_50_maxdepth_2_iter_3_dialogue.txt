Key Improvements:

* **Clearer Structure:**  The code now directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Meaningful Threshold:** The `income per dependent` threshold is set to 4, but remember this is an example and would need to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis.
* **Correct Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to use the `predict` function.
* **Docstrings:**  Includes a docstring to explain the function's purpose and parameters.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hints for clarity.


This revised code provides a functional implementation of the decision tree, following the specified format and incorporating best practices. Remember to replace the example threshold with a value derived from data analysis for a real-world application.
