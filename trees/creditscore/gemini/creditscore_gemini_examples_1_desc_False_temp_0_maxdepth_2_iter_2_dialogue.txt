Key improvements:

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  The code now explicitly includes the threshold values for income and derogatory reports, making the logic more transparent.
* **Correct Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Example Usage:** Includes example usage with print statements to demonstrate how the function works.
* **Docstrings:**  Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose and parameters.
* **Aligned with Problem Description:**  The logic now directly corresponds to the decision tree described earlier, considering different thresholds for derogatory reports based on income.


This improved version is functional, well-commented, and directly addresses the prompt's requirements.  Remember, though, that without training data, these thresholds are hypothetical and might not reflect real-world credit scoring practices.
