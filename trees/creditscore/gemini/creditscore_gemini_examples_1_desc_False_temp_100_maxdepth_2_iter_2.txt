```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Reasoning for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

For this synthetic example (without actual data), I've chosen "Derogatory.reports" and "Income.per.dependent" as the most important features and set thresholds intuitively based on how these features might influence credit approval.

* **Derogatory.reports:** A higher number of derogatory reports likely signifies a higher risk, making approval less likely.  I've chosen 0 as a threshold, assuming that even a single report could have a negative impact.
* **Income.per.dependent:**  Higher income per dependent suggests a better ability to repay debt. I've set the threshold at 5.5 (mid-range of the provided scale), assuming income above this is a positive indicator.

**Depth and Tree Structure:**

The generated function implements a decision tree of depth 2, with two inner nodes. The tree's logic follows the nested if-else structure to arrive at a prediction.  The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values of the conditions at each node, as requested.


**Important Note:** This decision tree is generated without any training data.  Its predictions are purely based on intuitive assumptions about the features. With real-world data, a trained decision tree would learn more complex relationships and likely have different splits and thresholds for optimal performance.
