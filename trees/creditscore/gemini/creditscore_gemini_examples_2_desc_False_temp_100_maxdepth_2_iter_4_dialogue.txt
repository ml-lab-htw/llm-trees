def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts credit application acceptance based on input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following features:
            - 'Age': Age (years)
            - 'Income.per.dependent': Income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
            - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': Monthly credit card expenses ($)
            - 'Own.home': Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - 'Self.employed': Self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - 'Derogatory.reports': Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = not accepted, 1 = accepted)
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.5  # Example threshold, adjust as needed
    nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] == 0  # Example threshold, adjust as needed

            prediction = 1  # Higher income, no derogatory reports - accept

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I chose 'Income.per.dependent' and 'Derogatory.reports' as the most important features for this example. These are likely strong indicators of creditworthiness.

2. **Thresholds:** I've added example thresholds (3.5 for income and 0 for derogatory reports) to demonstrate how the decision tree works. You'll need to adjust these thresholds based on your data and analysis.

3. **Decision Logic:**  The code implements the decision tree logic based on the chosen features and thresholds. 

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. You should:

* **Train the model:**  Use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) to train a decision tree classifier on real credit application data to find the optimal features, thresholds, and tree structure. 
* **Evaluate the model:**  Test the model's performance on unseen data to make sure it generalizes well. 
* **Feature Engineering:** Consider creating Features or transforming existing ones to improve model accuracy (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).
