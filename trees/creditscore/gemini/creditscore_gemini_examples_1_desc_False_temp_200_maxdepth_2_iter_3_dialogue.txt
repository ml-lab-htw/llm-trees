```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1  # Node 1: More than one derogatory report
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4 # Node 2: Income per dependent less than or equal to 4

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected if more than one derogatory report
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected if low income and not many derogatory reports
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted if higher income and not many derogatory reports

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clear Thresholds:** The provided thresholds for income (4) and derogatory reports (1) are now explicitly used in the code. These values should ideally be determined by analyzing a dataset and might need adjustment.
2. **Feature Names:**  The code now uses the correct feature names from the provided list (e.g., "Derogatory.reports").
3. **Target Encoding:**  The function returns 0 for rejection and 1 for acceptance, consistent with the specified target encoding.
4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly reflects the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is true, 0 if false).
5. **Simplified Logic:** The nested `if` statements clearly implement the decision tree logic based on the chosen features and thresholds.



**Example Usage:**

```python
applicant_data = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 7,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]


applicant_data2 = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 7,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Rejected)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```


This improved function correctly implements the decision tree logic, uses the specified feature names and target encoding, and provides a clear and interpretable output. Remember to determine appropriate thresholds based on real-world data analysis if you intend to use this in a practical application.
