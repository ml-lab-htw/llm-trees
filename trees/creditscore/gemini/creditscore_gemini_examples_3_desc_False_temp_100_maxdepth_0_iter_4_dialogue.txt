I understand now. You don't need me to train a decision tree on a dataset; you want me to translate a specific decision tree logic into a Python function.

Here's the function based on the features and target you've provided, along with some reasonable threshold choices:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts credit application acceptance based on applicant features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of applicant features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values 
               for each inner node condition.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Derogatory Reports - High number suggests risk
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 2 
    
    # Node 1: Income per Dependent (assuming higher is better)
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.0 
    
    # Node 2:  Monthly Credit Card Expenses (high expenses relative to income?)
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 0.4 * (X['Income.per.dependent'] * 12) 

    # Node 3: Age (younger applicants might be considered riskier)
    nodes[3] = X['Age'] < 25

    # Node 4: Owning a Home (often seen as stability)
    nodes[4] = X['Own.home'] == 0  # Not owning a home

    # Decision Logic based on the tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # High derogatory reports
        prediction = 0  # Likely rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Low income per dependent
            if nodes[2]:  # High credit card expenses relative to income
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:  # Higher income per dependent
            if nodes[3] and nodes[4]: # Young and not owning a home
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage
applicant_features = {
    'Age': 23,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 800,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1, 
    'Derogatory.reports': 1 
}

prediction, node_values = predict(applicant_features)
print(f"Prediction: {"Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected"}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {node_values}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict(X)` Function:**
   - Takes a dictionary `X` of applicant features as input.
   - Initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each node.
   - **Node Conditions:**  Sets up the conditions for each node. I've chosen some reasonable thresholds, but you might adjust them based on domain knowledge or analysis of a real dataset.
   - **Decision Logic:** The nested `if-else` statements implement the decision logic of the tree, leading to the final `prediction`.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Creates an example `applicant_features` dictionary.
   - Calls the `predict` function to get the prediction and node values.
   - Prints the results.

**Important Notes:**

* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds I used are just examples. In a real application, you'd determine these thresholds through data analysis and model training.
* **Missing Features:** The code assumes all features are present in the input dictionary. You might want to add error handling for missing features. 
* **Tree Complexity:** This is a relatively simple decision tree. You might need a more complex tree with more nodes and branches to capture the nuances of credit risk assessment accurately.

This Python function represents a basic decision tree classifier for credit scoring. You can test it with different applicant profiles and adjust the thresholds to explore different decision boundaries.
