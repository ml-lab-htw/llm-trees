def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1 
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.5 
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 800 

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 
        else:
            prediction = 1 
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation:**

This decision tree was built with a maximum depth of 2, meaning it has two levels of decision nodes before reaching a prediction.

* **Node 0 (Root):** This node checks if 'Derogatory.reports' is less than or equal to 1. This is a key factor in credit risk assessment, as a higher number of derogatory reports often indicates a higher likelihood of default. 
* **Node 1 (Left Child):**  If 'Derogatory.reports' are low (<= 1), this node checks 'Income.per.dependent'. A lower income per dependent might suggest difficulty managing debt, leading to a prediction of 0 (application rejected).
* **Node 2 (Right Child):**  If 'Derogatory.reports' are high (> 1), this node examines 'Monthly.credit.card.exp'. High credit card expenses combined with a poor credit history could suggest financial instability, leading to a prediction of 0. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds (1, 4.5, 800)  are examples and should be optimized using a larger dataset and techniques like cross-validation.
* **Feature Importance:**  This tree suggests 'Derogatory.reports' is the most important feature, followed by 'Income.per.dependent' and 'Monthly.credit.card.exp'.
* **Overfitting:** A depth-2 tree is very simple and may not generalize well to unseen data. A more complex tree or different model might be needed for better accuracy. 

This code provides a basic framework for building a credit approval prediction function. You can further refine this model by incorporating more features, adjusting thresholds, and increasing the tree depth if necessary.
