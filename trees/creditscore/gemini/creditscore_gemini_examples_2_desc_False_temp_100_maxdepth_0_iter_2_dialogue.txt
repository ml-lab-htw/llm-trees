**Explanation:**

This decision tree prioritizes the following:

1. **Derogatory Reports:** A higher number of derogatory reports is a strong indicator of risk.
2. **Income per Dependent:** If derogatory reports are low, a lower income per dependent suggests higher financial strain.
3. **Age:** Younger applicants with low income and low derogatory reports may be considered higher risk.
4. **Monthly Credit Card Expenses:**  High expenses combined with high derogatory reports are a red flag.
5. **Owning a Home:**  Homeownership can indicate stability, potentially mitigating some risk in cases with high derogatory reports and expenses.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified example and the thresholds (e.g., 4.0 for income, 25 for age) are arbitrary. To create a truly effective decision tree, you need a labeled dataset and a decision tree learning algorithm to determine the optimal thresholds and feature importance.
