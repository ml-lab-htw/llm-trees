def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] < 3
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 0.5 * X["Income.per.dependent"]


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0 # Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 1 # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes[:3]  # Return only the used nodes

```


This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single data point (application) with the specified feature keys.  It follows the decision tree logic outlined in my previous response. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each inner node for interpretability. The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values.  The threshold of 0.5 for credit card expenses relative to income remains, and as mentioned before, in a real-world scenario, this would be learned from data.  The slicing `nodes[:3]` ensures that only the relevant node truth values are returned, as the list was initialized with extra capacity.
