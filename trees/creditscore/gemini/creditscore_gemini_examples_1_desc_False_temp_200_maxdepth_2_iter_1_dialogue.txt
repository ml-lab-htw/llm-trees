**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've set a threshold of 4 for `Income.per.dependent`. This is a hypothetical value; in a real application, this would be determined based on data analysis and risk assessment.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now correctly reflects the truth values of the decision nodes.  A `None` value in the second element indicates that the second node was not evaluated (because the first condition was false).
* **Clearer Logic:** The code is slightly restructured for readability, with comments explaining the decision logic at each branch.
* **Example Usage:** The added examples demonstrate how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.


This revised function accurately represents the decision tree logic and provides a clear and usable interface. Remember that this is a simplified example, and real-world credit scoring models would be significantly more complex.
