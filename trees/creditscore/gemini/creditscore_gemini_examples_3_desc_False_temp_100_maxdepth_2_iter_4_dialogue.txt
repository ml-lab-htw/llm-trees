**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The code defines a function `predict(X)` that takes a dictionary `X` of features as input.
2. **Nodes Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree.
3. **Feature Selection and Thresholds:**  
   - `nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 5.0`: This line represents the condition at the root node of the decision tree. It checks if the 'Income.per.dependent' is less than or equal to 5.0. If the condition is True (income is low), `nodes[0]` is set to 1; otherwise, it's set to 0.
   - `nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1`: This represents the condition at the child nodes. It checks if the number of 'Derogatory.reports' is greater than 1. If True (many reports), `nodes[1]` is 1; otherwise, it's 0.
4. **Decision Making:**
   - The `if` and `else` blocks determine the prediction (approve or deny credit) based on the values in `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`, effectively traversing the decision tree.
5. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns a tuple: `(prediction, nodes)`. 
     - `prediction` (0 or 1) represents whether the application is denied or approved.
     - `nodes` is the list containing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node, indicating the path taken through the tree.

**Remember:** The chosen features, thresholds (5.0 for income, 1 for derogatory reports), and the specific tree structure are hypothetical examples in the absence of real data. To create a more accurate model, you would need to analyze a dataset and use algorithms to determine the most relevant features and optimal thresholds.
