**Example Usage:**

```python
example_applicant = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 3.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1000,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_applicant)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Approved)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, False, True, False]

example_applicant2 = {
    'Age': 22,
    'Income.per.dependent': 2.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 900,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 3
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_applicant2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Denied)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True, False, True]
```



**Explanation of the Code and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Conditionals:** The nested `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.
* **Descriptive Comments:** Comments explain the reasoning behind each branch of the tree.
* **Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Target Encoding:** Adheres to the 0/1 encoding for the target variable.
* **Realistic Thresholds:** Uses plausible thresholds based on general credit risk assessments.  These could be refined with real data.
* **Handles Division by Zero:** Though not in the initial tree, real data might have cases where `Income.per.dependent` is zero.  A robust model would need to handle this (e.g., imputation, separate branch).



This revised function provides a functional implementation of the decision tree and gives insight into the decision process with the `nodes` list. Remember that this remains a simplified example. Real-world credit scoring systems are far more complex.
