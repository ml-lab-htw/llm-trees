```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

For a credit application acceptance prediction, intuitively, "Derogatory.reports" and "Income.per.dependent" are likely to be highly influential. A higher number of derogatory reports would suggest a higher risk, making acceptance less likely.  A higher income per dependent would indicate a greater ability to repay, making acceptance more likely.

The decision tree uses these features with simple thresholds. The tree first checks "Derogatory.reports". If it's 0 (no derogatory reports), the tree proceeds to check "Income.per.dependent".  If income is low (<= 5), the prediction leans towards rejection (0).  Otherwise (higher income), it leans towards acceptance (1).  If "Derogatory.reports" is greater than 0, the prediction is rejection (0) regardless of income, as derogatory reports are a strong negative indicator.

This structure makes intuitive sense for credit risk assessment and provides a simple example within the depth constraint. Note that this tree is generated without training data, so it's a heuristic example and not optimized for performance on a real dataset.  A real-world application would require training a decision tree model on actual data to find the best features and thresholds.
