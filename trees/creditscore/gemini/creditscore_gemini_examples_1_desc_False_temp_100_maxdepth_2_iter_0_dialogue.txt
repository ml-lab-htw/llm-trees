    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2  # First inner node (left side of tree)

    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2  # condition at depth 2, first inner node
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0 # condition at depth 2, second inner node
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Denied

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function takes a dictionary `X` representing the features of a single application and returns the prediction (0 for denied, 1 for approved) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision nodes. The `nodes` list helps to understand the path taken through the decision tree.  For example, `nodes = [True, False]` would mean the first condition was met, but the second was not.


This function implements the same decision logic as the hypothetical tree described in the previous response, using the specified feature names and target encoding. Remember, this tree is based on assumed feature importance and thresholds and should ideally be trained on real-world data for accurate credit application prediction.
