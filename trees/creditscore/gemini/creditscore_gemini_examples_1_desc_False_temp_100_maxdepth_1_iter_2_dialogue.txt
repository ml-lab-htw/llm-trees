```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree

    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1  # Using 1 as the threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth value of the single decision node. The threshold for "Derogatory.reports" is set to 1, meaning one or fewer derogatory reports generally leads to acceptance, while more than one leads to rejection. This threshold could be adjusted based on specific risk tolerance and data analysis if a dataset were available.  The function adheres to the specified feature names, target variable encoding (0=no, 1=yes), and the provided example format.
