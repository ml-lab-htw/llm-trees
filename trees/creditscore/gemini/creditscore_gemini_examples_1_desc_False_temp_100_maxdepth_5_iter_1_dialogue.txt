This Python function implements the previously described hypothetical decision tree.  It takes a dictionary `X` representing a single application, with feature names as keys (matching the provided list).  It returns the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and a list `nodes` containing the truth values of the inner decision nodes.

Remember, this tree is *hypothetical* and built without real data.  The thresholds and feature choices are based on reasonable assumptions, but a real-world credit application decision tree would require training on a dataset of past applications. This function's purpose is to demonstrate the structure and logic of a decision tree, not to make actual credit decisions.
