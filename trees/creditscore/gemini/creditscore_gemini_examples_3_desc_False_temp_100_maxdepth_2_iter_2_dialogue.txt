def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 0.5 
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.25
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 850 
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 
        else:
            prediction = 0 
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
              
    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Feature Selection:** I've chosen 'Derogatory.reports', 'Income.per.dependent', and 'Monthly.credit.card.exp' as they are likely strong indicators of creditworthiness.
* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (0.5, 4.25, 850) are placeholders.  To find optimal thresholds, you would typically analyze the data distribution and relationship to credit acceptance using techniques like:
    * **Data Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, scatter plots to see how the features relate to the target.
    * **Statistical Measures:**  Calculate means, medians, percentiles for different target classes.
    * **Decision Tree Learning Algorithms:**  Use algorithms like ID3, C4.5, or CART, which automatically find good splitting points in the data.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example with arbitrary thresholds. You'll need a labeled credit application dataset to train a real decision tree model and find the most accurate decision boundaries.
