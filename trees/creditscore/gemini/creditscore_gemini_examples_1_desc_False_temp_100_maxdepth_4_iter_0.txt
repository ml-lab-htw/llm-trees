**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **No Training:** The generated decision tree is **not trained** on any data.  It's a structured example based on arbitrary thresholds and feature combinations. To create a *meaningful* decision tree, you *must* train it using a suitable algorithm (e.g., CART, ID3, C4.5) on a relevant dataset.

2. **Feature Importance:**  In a real-world scenario, feature importance is determined by the training process.  The decision tree algorithm identifies which features best separate the data based on the target variable.  Here, the choice of features and thresholds in the provided example is entirely arbitrary and for illustrative purposes.

3. **Depth and Nodes:**  The code ensures the tree has a maximum depth of 4 and can have up to 15 inner nodes.  The example tree uses 10 inner nodes. You can adjust the number and combination of conditions in the `if-else` structure to change the tree's complexity within these limits.

4. **Python Function Format:**  The code follows the specified format, returning the prediction and a list of truth values representing the inner nodes' conditions.

5. **Reusing Features:**  Notice that features like `Income.per.dependent`, `Monthly.credit.card.exp`, `Age`, and `Derogatory.reports` are reused in different nodes with varying thresholds.  This is a common practice in decision trees to capture different aspects of feature influence.

**To use the function:**

```python
example_input = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # This will show which conditions were true/false in the path
```


To create a truly effective decision tree, you'll need to use a machine learning library like scikit-learn and train it with data.  This example demonstrates the basic structure and format of a decision tree prediction function in Python.
