**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 5 * [None]`:  Creates a list called `nodes` with 5 elements, all initialized to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree.

2. **Node Conditions:**
   - Each `nodes[i] = ...` line represents a decision node in the tree. The expression on the right-hand side of the assignment operator (`=`) evaluates to `True` or `False` based on the input features (`X`) and the chosen thresholds.
     - `nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] >= 2`: This node checks if the number of derogatory reports is greater than or equal to 2.
     - ... (similarly for other nodes)

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - The `if-else` statements implement the decision logic of the tree. The structure of these statements mirrors the branches of the decision tree, determining the prediction based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.

4. **Thresholds:**
   - I've filled in some example thresholds for income, credit expenses, and age. These are just illustrative!  **You would need to use a dataset and potentially techniques like cross-validation to find optimal thresholds that result in the best predictive performance on your specific problem.**

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns two things:
     - `prediction`: The predicted class label (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted).
     - `nodes`: The list of truth values for the inner nodes, which provides insights into the decision path taken for a particular input.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_applicant = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1000, 
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")          # Output: Nodes: [False, True, False, True, False]
```

This output indicates the applicant was predicted to be accepted (1), and the decision path involved nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, with their corresponding truth values in the `nodes` list.
