**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The provided features relate to credit risk assessment.  Without training data, we have to make reasonable assumptions about feature importance for credit decisions.

1. **Derogatory Reports:**  The presence of derogatory reports is a strong indicator of poor creditworthiness. This is likely the most important feature, so it's used at the root of the tree.

2. **Income per Dependent:** Affordability is a key factor.  A higher income per dependent suggests a better ability to manage debt.  This is used as the second split.

3. **Age:** Age can be a proxy for financial stability (though discriminatory if used improperly). Older applicants are often perceived as lower risk due to longer credit histories and established financial patterns. This is used as the third split.

4. **Other Features:** "Monthly.credit.card.exp", "Own.home", and "Self.employed" could be important. However, without training data, it's difficult to determine their relative importance compared to the top three. A real decision tree trained on data would likely incorporate these features as well.

**Depth and Nodes:**  The generated tree has a maximum depth of 3 and uses 3 inner nodes (the conditional checks on the features). This meets the requirement of a depth between 3 and 7 nodes.

**Important:** This decision tree is based on intuitive assumptions about credit risk.  A real-world credit scoring model would be much more complex and require training on a large dataset to capture nuanced relationships between features and creditworthiness.  This example demonstrates how to construct the *structure* of a decision tree based on feature importance considerations, but it does *not* represent a statistically valid or reliable credit scoring system.
