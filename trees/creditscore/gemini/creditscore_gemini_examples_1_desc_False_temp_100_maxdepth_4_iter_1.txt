**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Maximum Depth and Nodes:** The code creates a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4. The `if/else` structure reflects the branching. While it initializes 15 nodes, not all will necessarily be used in every prediction path.  This structure allows for between 4 and 15 inner nodes, covering the specified range.

2. **Feature Importance (Intuitive):**  The code uses an intuitive approach to feature importance.  `Derogatory.reports` is chosen for the first split, as it's likely a strong indicator of creditworthiness. Then `Income.per.dependent` and `Monthly.credit.card.exp` are used, assuming financial stability matters. Age, homeownership, and self-employment are considered less crucial in this example, appearing deeper in the tree.  (In a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined through training and evaluation on data, not intuition.)

3. **Python Function Format:** The code is formatted as a Python function that takes a dictionary `X` (representing the features) as input and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.

4. **Node Conditions:** The conditions in the inner nodes are based on simple threshold comparisons using intuitive cutoff values.  These thresholds (e.g., `Income.per.dependent` <= 4, `Monthly.credit.card.exp` > 500) are arbitrarily chosen as we're not training on data.  In a real-world scenario, a decision tree learning algorithm would learn these thresholds from the training data.

5. **No Training:** The tree is generated *without* training on any data. It's a purely structural example of a decision tree of a specified depth based on given features. The prediction logic within the tree is arbitrary.



**Important:** This decision tree is not meant to be accurate or predictive.  Its purpose is solely to demonstrate the required format and structure of a decision
