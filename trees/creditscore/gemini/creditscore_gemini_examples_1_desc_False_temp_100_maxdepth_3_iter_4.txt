    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory reports present
        prediction = 0  # Likely rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Low income per dependent
            if nodes[2]:  # Older applicant
                prediction = 0  # Likely rejected
            else:  # Younger applicant
                prediction = 1  # Might be accepted
        else:  # High income per dependent
            prediction = 1  # Likely accepted

    return prediction, nodes


```


**Explanation and Justification:**

The generated decision tree prioritizes "Derogatory.reports" as the most crucial feature. Derogatory reports significantly impact creditworthiness. A high number of reports suggests risk, likely leading to rejection.

"Income.per.dependent" is considered next.  Lower income per dependent may indicate financial strain, making approval less likely, particularly for older applicants who might be closer to retirement or have higher expenses. Younger applicants with low income per dependent might still be deemed acceptable if they show potential.

"Age" further refines the decision-making process.  Older applicants with low income per dependent are considered higher risk, while younger applicants might be given more leeway assuming they have better prospects for income growth.

This structure creates a decision tree that uses simple, interpretable rules based on the provided features.  It aligns with common sense reasoning regarding credit applications, without requiring training data.  Importantly, it adheres to the specified maximum depth of 3 and returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Feature Importance:**  The chosen feature order is a *heuristic*.  In reality, the importance of these features would need to be determined through data analysis and potentially more sophisticated feature selection methods if you had access to training data.
* **Simplified Logic:** The tree's logic is simplified for demonstration.  A real-world credit application system uses more complex models and factors.
* **No Training:** The prompt explicitly states *not* to train on data. This solution creates a reasonable example tree based on general domain knowledge but isn't optimized for any particular dataset.
* **Depth and Nodes:** The tree satisfies the depth requirement (3) and uses between 3 and 7 inner nodes (it has exactly 3 in this case).


This approach provides a functional decision tree classifier that follows the given instructions.  If you have training data, employing a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) would allow you to build a much more accurate and robust model.
