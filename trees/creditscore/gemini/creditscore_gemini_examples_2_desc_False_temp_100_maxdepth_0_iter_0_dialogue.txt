**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized to store the truth values of each decision node in the tree. 
2. **Decision Nodes:** Each `nodes[i]` element represents a decision node in the tree. It evaluates a condition based on the input features (from the `X` dictionary) and stores True (1) if the condition is met, False (0) otherwise.
3. **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable thresholds where placeholders existed. For example:
    -  `nodes[2]`: Credit card expenses exceeding 40% of monthly income might be a rejection factor.
    -  `nodes[4]`:  Age below 25 might be considered higher risk (this is just an example, adjust based on your data).
4. **Prediction:** The `prediction` variable is set to 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted) based on the path taken through the tree as determined by the truth values in `nodes`.

**Important:**

* This Python function implements the decision tree logic I outlined previously. The thresholds and some decision nodes are based on assumptions. You **must** adjust these based on insights from your actual credit application dataset and business rules.
* Consider using a decision tree algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) and a labeled dataset to build a more accurate and robust credit scoring model.
