```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = float(X["Income.per.dependent"]) <= 3.0  # Low income threshold
    nodes[1] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"]) >= 2  # High derogatory reports
    nodes[2] = float(X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"]) > 0.5 * float(X["Income.per.dependent"]) * 1000  # High spending relative to income


    if nodes[0]:  # Low income per dependent
        if nodes[1]:  # High derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:  # Lower derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # Denied (Still risky due to low income)
    else:  # Higher income per dependent
        if nodes[2]:  # High spending
            prediction = 0  # Denied (Potential overspending)
        else:  # Reasonable spending
            prediction = 1  # Approved

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Type Handling:** The code now explicitly converts feature values to the appropriate types (float for income and expenses, int for derogatory reports) to avoid potential type-related errors.
* **Clearer Thresholds:** The threshold values are embedded directly in the conditions, making the logic easier to understand.
* **List Initialization:** The `nodes` list is initialized with the correct size (3 in this case, corresponding to the three internal nodes of the decision tree).
* **Consistent Feature Names:** The code uses the exact feature names provided, including capitalization and punctuation.
* **Target Variable Encoding:**  The function returns 0 for "no" (denied) and 1 for "yes" (approved), consistent with the provided encoding.



This improved function directly implements the decision tree logic described previously, handles potential type issues, and uses the correct feature names and target encoding.  It's ready to be used with a dictionary of feature values as input. Remember, this tree is based on assumptions; a real-world application would require training on actual data.
