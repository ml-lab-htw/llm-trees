**Explanation of Threshold Choices:**

* **Derogatory Reports (<= 1.5):** A low number of derogatory reports likely indicates a good credit history, making approval more likely.
* **Income per Dependent (<= 4.5):** This threshold splits applicants by income relative to dependents. Lower income per dependent might suggest a higher risk. 
* **Monthly Credit Card Expenses (<= $800):**  Lower credit card expenses might indicate better financial management and thus, higher approval chances.
* **Age (<= 35):** Younger applicants might have shorter credit histories, potentially leading to a lower chance of approval.

**Important Notes:**

* **These thresholds are examples.** Without actual data and model training, these are educated guesses.  You'll need to train a real decision tree model on your credit application data to get optimal thresholds.
* **Feature Importance:** The order of these features in the tree also reflects an assumed level of importance. Again, actual feature importance is determined during model training. 

This function mimics the structure of your examples. You provide a dictionary of features (`X`) to the `predict` function, and it returns both the predicted class (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and a list showing the truth values for each node condition.
