**Explanation and Reasoning for Tree Structure:**

This generated function represents a decision tree without actual training.  It uses the provided features and a plausible structure for credit application approval.  Here's the logic behind the feature choices in this *hypothetical* decision tree:

* **Age:** Younger applicants (<=35) might be perceived as higher risk due to potentially less established credit history.
* **Income.per.dependent:** Higher income per dependent suggests better financial stability and ability to repay.
* **Monthly.credit.card.exp:** High credit card expenses could indicate potential overspending, even with higher income.
* **Own.home:** Homeownership is often considered a sign of stability.
* **Derogatory.reports:**  Any derogatory reports are a strong negative indicator for creditworthiness.

The tree structure itself is designed to prioritize these factors in a hierarchical manner, with derogatory reports and homeownership playing significant roles, followed by spending habits, income, and age. Note: this decision tree is a demonstration, and it is NOT trained on data; it represents a *possible* way these features *could* be used for a credit approval decision. A real-world decision tree would require training on a dataset to determine the optimal thresholds and feature importance.

The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1 for credit application denial or approval) and the list `nodes`, which shows the truth value of each condition at each node. This `nodes` list is useful for understanding the path the decision-making process takes for a given input.
