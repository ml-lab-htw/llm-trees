**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The generated decision tree uses a depth of 5 and incorporates if/else conditions based on the provided features.  The features I selected  intuitively seem more related to creditworthiness.  "Derogatory.reports" is a strong indicator of credit risk, followed by income, age, expenses, and homeownership.

* **Derogatory.reports:** A higher number of derogatory reports likely leads to rejection.
* **Age & Income.per.dependent:** Younger applicants and those with lower income per dependent might be considered higher risk.
* **Monthly.credit.card.exp:** High credit card expenses relative to income could indicate financial strain.
* **Own.home:** Homeownership can be a sign of stability and might positively influence credit decisions.

The specific thresholds (e.g., age <= 35, income <= 4, expenses > 500) are arbitrary in this example because we are not training the tree on real data.  A real decision tree algorithm would learn these thresholds from data to optimize predictive accuracy.  The structure and logic demonstrate how a decision tree of depth 5 could be built with these features.

The code ensures that all paths through the tree lead to a prediction (either 0 or 1).  The `nodes` list is constructed to store the truth values (1 or 0) of each condition, facilitating interpretation of the decision path. This list is converted to integers using a list comprehension before being returned.
