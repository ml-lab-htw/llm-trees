**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**  The code defines a function `predict(X)` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the applicant's features.
2. **Nodes Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list to store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each decision node. Since we have a maximum depth of 2, we initialize two elements.
3. **Decision Node 1:**
   - `nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] > 5.0` checks if the applicant's 'Income.per.dependent' is greater than 5.0 (this threshold is an example, you can adjust it based on data analysis). 
   - If the condition is True, `nodes[0]` is set to 1 (or True), otherwise 0 (or False).
4. **Decision Node 2:**
   - The second decision depends on the outcome of the first. 
   - **If `nodes[0]` is True** (high income), we check `nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1` (are derogatory reports low?). 
   - **If `nodes[0]` is False** (low income), we check `nodes[1] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 800` (are credit card expenses low?).
5. **Final Prediction:**
   - The code uses `if-elif-else` to determine the final prediction based on the combination of `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`. 
   - You'll need to adjust these conditions and thresholds (5.0, 800, etc.) based on the patterns you find in your data and the risk tolerance for credit acceptance.
6. **Return:** The function returns a tuple: `(prediction, nodes)`. The `prediction` is either 0 (reject) or 1 (accept), and `nodes` is the list containing the truth values (1 or 0) for the decisions made at each inner node.

**Remember:** 

- This is a simplified example. Real-world credit scoring models are much more complex.
- You **must** analyze your data to determine the most important features, appropriate thresholds, and the logic for combining them to make credit decisions. 
- Consider using machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn) to build more robust decision trees and other classification models.
