```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0  # Most important feature guess 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5 # Most important feature guess 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Likely rejected if low income and derogatory reports
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Likely accepted if higher income and no derogatory reports
    else:
        prediction = 0 # Likely rejected if derogatory reports exist

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The task is to create a decision tree classifier *without any training data*. We only have feature descriptions and the target variable description.  Therefore, we have to make educated guesses about which features are most influential and how they might relate to the target variable (credit application acceptance).

**Feature Importance Guesses:**

* **`Derogatory.reports`:** This feature seems highly likely to influence credit acceptance.  A higher number of derogatory reports strongly suggests a higher risk, leading to rejection.
* **`Income.per.dependent`:** Income relative to dependents is another key factor. Higher income per dependent suggests greater financial stability and ability to repay, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Decision Tree Structure (Depth 2):**

The decision tree prioritizes `Derogatory.reports`. If there are *any* derogatory reports (i.e., > 0), it leans towards rejecting the application.  If there are no derogatory reports, it then considers `Income.per.dependent`.  A lower income per dependent (< 5) suggests lower chances of acceptance, while a higher income per dependent suggests better chances.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This solution is entirely based on assumptions about feature importance and their relationships with the target. With real-world data, the actual decision tree learned could be quite different.
* **Maximum Depth 2:** The problem specifies a maximum depth of 2.  This limits the complexity of the tree and how many features we can use.
* **Python Function Format:** The code is provided as a Python function that takes a dictionary of features (`X`) as input and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and a list representing the truth values of the decision nodes.


This approach provides a reasonable initial decision tree based on the limited information available. To build a more accurate and robust classifier, you would need to train a decision tree model on a labeled dataset.
