```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0  # Threshold for low income
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] >= 2   # Threshold for multiple derogatory reports
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 0.5 * X["Income.per.dependent"]  # High credit card expenses relative to income
    #nodes[3] =  Not used in this simplified tree (depth 4)


    if nodes[0]:  # Low income
        if nodes[1]:  # Multiple derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:  # Few or no derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # Denied (Low income is dominant)
    else:  # Higher income
        if nodes[1]:  # Multiple derogatory reports
            if nodes[2]:  # High credit card expenses
                prediction = 0  # Denied
            else:  # Manageable credit card expenses
                prediction = 1  # Approved (Derogatory reports might be less impactful)
        else: # Few or no derogatory reports
            prediction = 1  # Approved


    return prediction, nodes

```



**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've used more specific threshold values that make some intuitive sense in the context of credit applications.  For example, an income per dependent of 3 or less is considered low, and credit card expenses exceeding 50% of income are flagged.
* **Feature Usage:** The decision tree uses the specified feature names exactly as provided.
* **Target Variable Mapping:** The function returns 0 for "no" (application denied) and 1 for "yes" (application approved), following the provided mapping.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values of the decision nodes within the tree, which can be useful for understanding the decision path.
* **Simplified Tree:** The tree still has a maximum depth of 4. A deeper or more complex tree might capture more nuanced relationships in real-world data, but we don't have the data to train such a tree here.



This refined function provides a more concrete implementation of the decision tree logic while respecting the provided feature names, target variable mapping, and depth constraint. Remember, this is still a hypothetical example.  A true credit application model would require training on real-world data for accuracy.
