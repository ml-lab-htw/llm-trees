**Explanation of the Decision Tree and Thresholds:**

1. **Derogatory Reports:** A high number of derogatory reports is a strong indicator of risk. I set the threshold at `> 2`. 
2. **Income per Dependent:** Low income per dependent suggests difficulty managing finances. Threshold: `< 4` (assuming your scale is out of 10).
3. **Monthly Credit Card Expenses:** High expenses relative to income can be risky. Threshold: `> $1500` (adjust based on typical income levels in your data).
4. **Age:** Younger applicants might have less credit history, but if they meet the other criteria, they are more likely to be accepted. Older applicants who own a home represent lower risk. Threshold: `> 30`
5. **Owning a Home:**  Homeownership generally implies stability. 

**Remember:**

* These thresholds are examples. You'll need to fine-tune them based on your data distribution and expert knowledge.
* The tree's structure is simplified. A real-world credit scoring model would likely be more complex, potentially considering interactions between features. 

**How to Use the Function:**

```python
# Example Input (representing one applicant)
applicant_data = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1200,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [False, False, False, True, True]
```
