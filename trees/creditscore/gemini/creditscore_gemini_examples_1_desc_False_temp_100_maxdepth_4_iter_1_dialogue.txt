This function directly implements the decision tree logic outlined in the previous response, using the specified feature names and thresholds. The `nodes` list tracks the truth value (True/False, represented as 1/0) of each decision node's condition, providing insight into the path taken through the tree for a given input.  Remember that this tree is based on assumed thresholds and feature importance, and would need to be trained on real data for accurate credit application prediction.
