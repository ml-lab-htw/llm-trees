    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 2
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] < 3
    nodes[2] = X['Own.home'] == 0  # Owning a home == no
    nodes[3] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 0.5 * X['Income.per.dependent']

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Denied
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Denied
            else:  # Owns a home
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0 # Denied
                else:
                    prediction = 1 # Approved

        else:  # Income per dependent >= 3

    return prediction, nodes

This Python function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree's logic.  It takes a dictionary `X` representing a single application, where keys are feature names and values are the feature values for that application. It returns the prediction (0 for denied, 1 for approved) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the inner nodes.  The thresholds (e.g., 2 for derogatory reports, 3 for income per dependent, 50% for expense ratio) are incorporated directly into the conditions.


Remember: This function is based on hypothetical rules.  A real-world credit scoring model requires training on actual data to determine appropriate thresholds and feature importance.
