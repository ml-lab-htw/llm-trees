def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2  # First inner node (left side of tree)

    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2  # condition at depth 2, first inner node
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0 # condition at depth 2, second inner node
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function directly implements the decision tree logic described earlier:

1. **`nodes` List:**  Stores the truth values of the decision nodes.

2. **Node 0:** Checks if "Derogatory.reports" is less than 1.

3. **Node 1:**  If no derogatory reports (Node 0 is True), checks if "Income.per.dependent" is greater than 3.

4. **Prediction:**  Based on the node conditions, the function returns the predicted class (0 for Denied, 1 for Approved) and the `nodes` list indicating which branches were taken.


This function does not require any training because the decision tree logic is hardcoded based on the assumptions we made about feature importance.  If you had training data, you would use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those from scikit-learn) to build the tree from the data.
