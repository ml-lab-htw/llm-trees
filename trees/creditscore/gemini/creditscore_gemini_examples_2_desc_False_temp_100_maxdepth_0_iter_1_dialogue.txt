**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing the features of a single credit applicant.

2. **Node Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 4 * [None]`: We initialize a list called `nodes` with four `None` values. Each element in this list will represent the truth value (True/False or 1/0) of the condition evaluated at each inner node of our decision tree.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - **Node 0:** `nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 2`:  This checks if the applicant has more than two derogatory reports. If True, the corresponding `nodes[0]` element becomes 1, otherwise 0.
   - **Node 1:** `nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3`: This checks if the applicant's income per dependent is less than or equal to 3.  The `nodes[1]` element is updated accordingly.
   - **Node 2:** `nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 0.5 * X['Income.per.dependent']`: This calculates if the applicant's monthly credit card expenses exceed 50% of their income per dependent. The `nodes[2]` element reflects the result.
   - **Node 3:** `nodes[3] = X['Age'] < 25`: This is an additional check.  It assesses if the applicant's age is below 25 (you can adjust this threshold based on domain knowledge or data analysis).

4. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree's flow, using the truth values stored in the `nodes` list to arrive at a prediction (0 for rejection, 1 for acceptance).

5. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns a tuple: `(prediction, nodes)`. 
     - `prediction`: The final prediction (0 or 1).
     - `nodes`: The list of truth values for the inner nodes, showing the path taken through the decision tree for the given input features.
