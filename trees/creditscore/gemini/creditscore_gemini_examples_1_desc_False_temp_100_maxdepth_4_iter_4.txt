Explanation of the Generated Tree and Function:

1. Node Initialization: The `nodes` list is initialized to accommodate a maximum of 15 inner nodes (although fewer might be used in a specific tree of depth 4).

2. Feature Selection and Conditions: The decision tree's structure and conditions are based on intuitive relationships between the features and the target variable ("target" – credit application acceptance). For example:
   - Younger applicants with high income per dependent and low credit card expenses might be more likely to be accepted.
   - Older, self-employed applicants with derogatory reports might be less likely to be accepted.
   - Homeownership could be a positive factor.

3. Depth and Branching: The code creates a tree with a depth of up to 4 by nesting `if-else` statements. The branching logic is designed to cover diverse scenarios.  The important thing to remember is that the tree structure is pre-determined – we are *not* learning it from data.  I've added some example extra nodes (6, 7, 8, 9) to show how you could increase the complexity up to depth 4 (and 15 inner nodes).

4. Prediction Assignment:  At the leaf nodes (the end of each branch), a prediction (0 or 1) for credit application acceptance is assigned based on the combination of feature values along the path.

5. Return Value: The function returns the final prediction and the `nodes` list.  The `nodes` list contains boolean values (True/False or 1/0) indicating whether each condition was met. This allows you to trace the path the prediction took through the tree.  Note that we only return the elements of the `nodes` list that we actually used in the tree.


Important: This generated decision tree is a *demonstration* of how to create the required Python function format. It is *not* a trained model, and its predictive performance is not guaranteed. To build a useful decision tree, you would need to train it on real data using a machine learning algorithm.
