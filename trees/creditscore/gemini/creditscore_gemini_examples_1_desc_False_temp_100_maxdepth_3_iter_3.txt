                prediction = 1 # Might be accepted if low income but controlled expenses

**Explanation of Feature Choices and Logic:**

The provided features relate to credit application acceptance.  The decision tree is structured based on intuitive assumptions about creditworthiness:

1. **Derogatory.reports:**  A strong negative indicator.  Having any derogatory reports likely leads to rejection.

2. **Income.per.dependent:** Income relative to dependents affects affordability.  Lower income per dependent increases the risk.

3. **Monthly.credit.card.exp:**  High expenses relative to income suggest potential financial strain.

The tree structure and predictions reflect these assumptions, prioritizing `Derogatory.reports` as the primary deciding factor, followed by income and expenses.  Note that this is a *heuristic* approach without actual data training.  A real-world model would require training on a dataset to determine the true feature importance and thresholds.
