def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root Node: Derogatory Reports 
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1 

    # Branch 1: Reject if high derogatory reports
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  

    # Branch 2: Further evaluation 
    else: 
        # Use Income per dependent
        nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] < 4.5  # Threshold set based on potential risk
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  
        else:
            prediction = 1 

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   -  `nodes = 2 * [None]`: We create a list called `nodes` to store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node of our tree. Since our tree has a maximum depth of 2, there can be at most 2 inner nodes. 

2. **Root Node (Derogatory Reports):**
   - `nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1`:  This line represents the root node's condition. If the applicant has more than one derogatory report, we consider it a strong indicator of risk. The truth value (True/False) of this comparison is stored in `nodes[0]`.

3. **Branch 1 (High Risk - Reject):**
   - `if nodes[0]: prediction = 0`: If `nodes[0]` is True (meaning the applicant has more than one derogatory report), we set the `prediction` to 0 (application rejected).

4. **Branch 2 (Further Evaluation):**
   - `else:`:  If `nodes[0]` is False (one or fewer derogatory reports), we move to the second level of the tree for further evaluation.
   - `nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] < 4.5`: We use 'Income.per.dependent' as our second feature. A threshold of 4.5 is set (you'd fine-tune this using data analysis). The truth value is stored in `nodes[1]`.
   -  The code then follows a similar logic as Branch 1 to make a prediction based on `nodes[1]`.

**Key Points:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (e.g., `> 1` for derogatory reports, `< 4.5` for income) should ideally be determined from data analysis to find optimal splits that minimize prediction errors.
* **Feature Importance:** This tree assumes 'Derogatory.reports' is the most important feature, followed by 'Income.per.dependent'. This assumption should be validated with data. 
* **Model Complexity:** A depth of 2 is very simplistic for credit risk modeling. Real-world applications would likely require more complex trees or other algorithms.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Always be mindful of potential bias when building credit models and ensure fairness and responsible use.
