**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've used 0 for "Derogatory.reports" and 4 for "Income.per.dependent" as thresholds, consistent with the previous explanation.  These are still somewhat arbitrary in the absence of training data, but reflect reasonable assumptions.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False) of the inner node conditions.  If a node is not reached (e.g., the left branch is taken at the root), its corresponding entry in `nodes` remains `None`.  This preserves information about which conditions were actually evaluated.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure now more closely follows the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.



This revised function provides the prediction and the intermediate node evaluations as requested. Remember, in a real-world application, you'd train a decision tree model on data to determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure.
