This function mirrors the decision tree logic described previously. It uses the specified feature names and their encoded values.  The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the decision nodes, allowing for interpretability of the decision path.  For example, `nodes = [True, False, True]` would indicate that the applicant had more than one derogatory report, income per dependent >= 4, and owned a home.  Even though the last two conditions suggest creditworthiness, the first condition (derogatory reports) overrules them, resulting in rejection.
