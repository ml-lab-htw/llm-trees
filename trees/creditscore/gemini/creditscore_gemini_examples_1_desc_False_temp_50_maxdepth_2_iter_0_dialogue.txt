**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Keys:** The code now uses the exact feature keys provided (e.g., "Derogatory.reports").
* **Thresholds:** Placeholder values (5 for `Income.per.dependent` and 500 for `Monthly.credit.card.exp`) are used. These should be determined based on data analysis or domain expertise.
* **Target Encoding:** The function returns 0 for rejection and 1 for acceptance, matching the specified encoding.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node.  These are then used for the final classification.
* **Readability:**  The code is formatted for improved readability and includes a docstring.


**Example Usage:**

```python
features = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 7,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 300,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]

features['Derogatory.reports'] = 2
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, True]


features['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] = 700  # Exceeding the threshold
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Rejected)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]



```


This improved function demonstrates the desired structure and incorporates the given feature names and target encoding.  Remember that the effectiveness of the decision tree depends heavily on the chosen thresholds, which ideally should be learned from training data.
