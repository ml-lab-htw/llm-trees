**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 2 * [None]`: Creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each decision node in the tree.

2. **Decision Node 1: Income.per.dependent**
   - `nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4`: This line evaluates the condition for the first decision node. It checks if the applicant's 'Income.per.dependent' is less than or equal to 4. The threshold of 4 is chosen as it's roughly the midpoint of the feature's range (1.5 to 10). 
      - If the condition is True (income is low), `nodes[0]` is set to 1 (or True).
      - If the condition is False (income is high), `nodes[0]` is set to 0 (or False).

3. **Decision Node 2: Conditional Branching**
   - `if nodes[0]:`: This checks the value of `nodes[0]`, which reflects the outcome of the first decision.
      - **If `nodes[0]` is True (low income):** 
          - `nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1`: We evaluate the number of 'Derogatory.reports'. A threshold of more than 1 derogatory report is used, assuming a higher number makes rejection more likely.
      - **Else (if `nodes[0]` is False, meaning high income):**
          - `nodes[1] = X['Own.home'] == 0`:  We check if 'Own.home' is 0, meaning the applicant *does not* own a home. This is based on the assumption that not owning a home might make approval less likely even with a high income.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The code uses nested `if/elif/else` statements to determine the final prediction (accept or reject) based on the truth values in the `nodes` list:
     - `if nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:`:  Accepts if low income AND few derogatory reports.
     - `elif not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:`: Accepts if high income AND owns a home.
     - `else:`: Rejects in all other cases.

5. **Return:**
   - `return prediction, nodes`: Returns both the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, which allows you to see the path the decision-making process took for a given input.
