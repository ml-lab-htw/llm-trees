This function now adheres more closely to the provided feature names and includes a credit utilization ratio.  The thresholds are still somewhat arbitrary as we lack real-world training data. However, they reflect common-sense credit risk assessments.  For example, an income per dependent less than 2.5 (assuming a scale of 1.5 to 10) would likely be considered low, and a credit utilization ratio above 30% is often viewed as a risk factor.  These values would be optimized with real data during model training. Remember, this is still a *demonstration* and not a production-ready credit scoring model.  Real credit scoring models are significantly more complex.
