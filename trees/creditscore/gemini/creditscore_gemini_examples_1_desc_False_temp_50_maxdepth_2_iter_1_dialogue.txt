**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've used 1 for `Derogatory.reports` and 4 for `Income.per.dependent` as thresholds. These are just reasonable guesses for demonstration. In a real application, you would determine these thresholds through data analysis and model training.
* **Feature Importance:** The tree is built based on the assumed importance of features as discussed in the previous response.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.  This is helpful for understanding the path taken by the decision tree for a particular prediction.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and follows a clear structure, making it easier to understand the logic.
* **Target Encoding:** The function now correctly returns 0 for rejection and 1 for acceptance, aligning with the provided target encoding.


**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


X = {
    'Age': 25,
    'Income.per.dependent': 2,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 700,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 3,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Rejected)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, None]
