Key Improvements:

* **Correct Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Thresholds:** Includes realistic threshold values for `Income.per.dependent` and uses the correct encoding for `Own.home`.
* **Node Values List:**  Returns the list of node truth values (0 or 1) as requested.
* **Clearer Logic:**  Improved comments and variable names for better readability.
* **Example Usage:** Provides example usage to demonstrate how to call the function.


This revised code accurately reflects the previously described decision tree logic and provides the requested output format. Remember that this is a simplified example and real-world credit scoring models are much more complex.
