    nodes[3] = X['Age'] > 35 

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # More than one derogatory report, likely rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent is low
            if nodes[2]: # High credit card expenses
                prediction = 0
            else: 
                prediction = 1 
        else: # Income per dependent is good
            if nodes[3]: # Older applicant
                prediction = 1

**Explanation:**

The decision tree logic is embedded in the `if-else` structure. Here's a breakdown:

- **Node 0: `Derogatory.reports > 1`** 
   - This is likely the most important feature. Having more than one derogatory report significantly impacts creditworthiness. Applications exceeding this threshold are likely rejected.
- **Node 1: `Income.per.dependent <= 4.5`** 
    - If income per dependent is low, it suggests a higher risk.
- **Node 2: `Monthly.credit.card.exp > 800`**
    - For applicants with low income per dependent, high credit card expenses further increase the risk.
- **Node 3: `Age > 35`**
    - For applicants with good income per dependent, age might play a role, with older applicants potentially having better credit history.

**Remember:** These thresholds are examples.  You'll need a labeled dataset and a decision tree learning algorithm to determine the optimal thresholds based on real-world data. 

This function takes a dictionary `X` representing an individual's features as input, evaluates the conditions in the decision tree, and returns:

- `prediction`: The predicted class (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted).
- `nodes`: A list representing the truth values (0 or 1) for each inner node condition. This allows you to trace the decision path taken for a given input.
