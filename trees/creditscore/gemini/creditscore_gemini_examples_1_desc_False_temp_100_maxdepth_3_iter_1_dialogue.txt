```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 2  # Adjusted threshold based on feature description
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] / X["Income.per.dependent"] > 0.3


    if nodes[0]: # Derogatory reports > 0
        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent <= 2
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:  # Income per dependent > 2 (but still has derogatory reports)
            prediction = 0  # Denied - likely, even with higher income
    else:  # Derogatory reports <= 0 (Good so far)
        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent <= 2 (despite no derogatory reports)
            prediction = 0 # Denied - low income is a strong negative factor
        else:  # Income per dependent > 2
            if nodes[2]: # High credit card expense to income ratio
                prediction = 0 # Denied - Overspending indicated
            else:  # Reasonable expenses compared to income
                prediction = 1  # Approved

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Thresholds:**  Adjusted thresholds to be more reasonable based on the feature descriptions (e.g., income per dependent from 3 to 2).
* **Derogatory Reports Handling:**  Gives high importance to derogatory reports.
* **Income per Dependent:** Remains a key factor after the derogatory reports check.
* **Ratio Calculation:** Directly calculates the ratio of credit card expenses to income.  This is more informative than using them as separate thresholds.
* **Node Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list accurately tracks the truth values of each decision point in the tree.


This improved version provides a more robust and realistic (although still simplified) credit application assessment function. Remember, a real-world model would be significantly more complex and trained on actual data. This example serves to demonstrate the structure and logic required.
