```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1  # More than one derogatory report
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4 # Low income per dependent

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Denied
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Approved

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Selection:** The provided features are used as discussed previously, prioritizing "Derogatory.reports" and "Income.per.dependent".
* **Thresholds:** Realistic threshold values are included (1 for derogatory reports and 4 for income per dependent).  These should be tuned with real data.
* **Encoded Features:** The function assumes that `Own.home` and `Self.employed` are already numerically encoded (1 for yes, 0 for no), aligning with the provided description.
* **Target Encoding:** The function returns 0 for "no" (denied) and 1 for "yes" (approved) matching the specified encoding.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly tracks the truth values of the decision nodes.


**Using the Function:**

You can call the `predict` function with a dictionary representing a single application:

```python
application_data = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 7,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(application_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Approved)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```


This improved version directly addresses the prompt's requirements and provides a more practical and usable solution.  Remember that optimizing the thresholds and potentially including other features would require training with a real dataset.
