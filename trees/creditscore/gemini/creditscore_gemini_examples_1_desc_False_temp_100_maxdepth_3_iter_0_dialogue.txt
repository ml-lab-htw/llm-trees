    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 2.5  # Adjusted threshold
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 0.4 * X["Income.per.dependent"]  # Using a ratio

        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent <= 2.5
            prediction = 0  # Possibly Denied (Simplified to Denied for this example)
        else:         # Income per dependent > 2.5
            if nodes[2]:  # Monthly credit card expenses > 0.4 * Income
                prediction = 0  # Possibly Denied (Simplified to Denied for this example)
            else:         # Monthly credit card expenses <= 0.4 * Income
                prediction = 1  # Approved


    return prediction, nodes



```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Adjustments:** The income threshold is adjusted to 2.5, and the credit card expense threshold is now a ratio (0.4 * income), making it more realistic.
* **Simplified "Possibly Denied":** To avoid returning ambiguous predictions without further information, "Possibly Denied" cases are simplified to "Denied" (0) in this limited-depth tree.  A real-world application would handle these cases differently, likely requiring a more complex model.
* **Clearer Structure:**  The code is structured to more closely follow the decision tree logic, improving readability.
* **Correct Feature Names:** The code uses the exact feature names provided, ensuring compatibility with the input data.
* **List for Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list correctly stores the boolean truth values (1 or 0) for the conditions at each inner node.


This revised function provides a more practical and interpretable implementation of the decision tree for credit application predictions within the given constraints.  It's still a simplification, but it's a better representation of how a basic decision tree would operate.  Remember that a real-world credit scoring model would be substantially more complex.
