```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0  # Most important feature
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5  # Second most important feature
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Reasoning behind feature selection and tree structure:**

In a credit application scenario, the number of derogatory reports is a very strong indicator of creditworthiness.  A higher number of derogatory reports suggests a higher risk, making it very unlikely for the application to be accepted. Therefore, "Derogatory.reports" is chosen as the root node.

Income per dependent is another important factor.  A higher income per dependent suggests a greater ability to manage debt and therefore a higher likelihood of application acceptance.  So, it is used as the second split.  

The specific threshold values (0 for derogatory reports and 5 for income per dependent) are chosen arbitrarily for the example, as we are not training the tree on real data.  A real decision tree algorithm would learn these thresholds from the training data.

The structure of the tree is designed to capture the intuition that:

* Few or no derogatory reports, combined with a reasonable income per dependent, likely leads to application approval.
* Any derogatory reports make approval unlikely, regardless of income.
* Low income per dependent makes approval less likely even with no derogatory reports.


It's important to note that this is a simplified example. A real-world credit application decision tree would likely be more complex, considering more features and having a greater depth to capture the nuances of credit risk assessment.
