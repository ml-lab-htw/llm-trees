**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Keys:**  Uses the exact feature keys provided.
* **Target Encoding:**  Returns 0 for rejected and 1 for accepted applications.
* **Threshold Values:** I've filled in reasonable placeholder values for thresholds based on typical credit assessment logic.  These are still hypothetical and would need to be optimized with real data. For example, the `0.5` in `X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 0.5 * X['Income.per.dependent']` represents a 50% debt-to-income ratio threshold for credit card expenses.
* **Home Ownership Encoding:** Assumes `0` represents "no" and `1` represents "yes" for `Own.home`, aligning with the provided encoding.
* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list now accurately tracks the truth value of each decision node in the tree, making the decision process more transparent.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The code is restructured to be more concise and readable, directly reflecting the branching logic of the decision tree.  Unnecessary nesting is removed.
* **Unused Self.employed:** In the original hypothetical tree, `Self.employed` wasn't used. It remains unused here to maintain consistency, but in a real-world application, you would likely incorporate this feature (and potentially others) and adjust the thresholds based on data analysis.



This revised function provides a clear, functional representation of the decision tree and returns both the prediction and the intermediate decision path.  Remember to replace the hypothetical threshold values with values derived from data analysis when you have a real dataset.  Using a machine learning library like scikit-learn is highly recommended for building decision trees from data as it handles all the complexities of training, optimization, and evaluation.
