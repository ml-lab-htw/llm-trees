**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** We create a list `nodes` with size 2 (for depth 2), initialized with `None`.  Each element will store the truth value (True/False or 1/0) of the corresponding node's condition.

2. **Root Node (nodes[0]):** 
   - We use 'Income.per.dependent' as the root split. The threshold is set to `4.5` (you might adjust this based on data analysis). 
   - If income per dependent is greater than 4.5, `nodes[0]` is set to `True` (or 1), otherwise `False` (or 0).

3. **Child Node (nodes[1]):**
   - This node is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `True` (high income).
   - We use 'Derogatory.reports' with a threshold of `1`.
   - If the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1, `nodes[1]` is set to `True`, otherwise `False`.

4. **Predictions:**
   - Based on the truth values in `nodes`, we determine the final prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted).
   - The logic here reflects an assumption that higher income and fewer derogatory reports generally lead to credit acceptance, but you should refine this based on your data.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. Building an effective credit scoring model requires careful data analysis, feature engineering, threshold optimization, and potentially a more complex decision tree or other machine learning algorithms.
