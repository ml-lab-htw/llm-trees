**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Number of Nodes:** The `nodes` list has been expanded to accommodate all the decision points in the tree.
* **Feature Access:** Features are accessed using the exact keys provided (e.g., `X['Income.per.dependent']`).
* **Encoding:**  The code uses `1` for "yes" and `0` for "no" for `Own.home` and `Self.employed` to match the provided encoding.
* **Thresholds:**  Meaningful threshold values have been added (e.g., `0.5 * X['Income.per.dependent']` for credit card expenses relative to income).  These are still hypothetical but illustrate how you would incorporate such logic.
* **Reachability:** An `else` clause has been added to the outermost `elif nodes[2]` to ensure all possible paths through the tree are covered. Although this `else` isn't conceptually reachable, it prevents errors in case unexpected input is received.


This revised code provides a more complete and functional implementation of the decision tree logic as a Python function.  Remember that this is still a simplified example and a true credit scoring model would be far more sophisticated.
