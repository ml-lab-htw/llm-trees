This function adheres to the specified format, using the provided feature names and a depth-2 structure. It also fills the threshold placeholders (T1, T2, T3) with reasonable values based on the feature descriptions and common-sense assumptions about creditworthiness. The function returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node, as requested.  Remember, these thresholds are just examples; real-world application would involve training on a dataset to find optimal thresholds.
