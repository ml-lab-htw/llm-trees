```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Adjustments:** The income threshold for the first level when derogatory reports are present was reduced to 2.5. The expense threshold is now relative to income (40%).  These adjustments reflect the increased risk associated with derogatory reports and the importance of manageable expenses.  These values are still illustrative; real-world thresholds would be learned from data.
* **Clearer Node Logic:** The code now directly implements the decision tree logic, making it easier to follow the decision path. The second node is reused when `nodes[0]` is true and represents a different conditional depending on the first node. 
* **Type Hinting:** The function signature now includes type hinting (`X: dict`) for better readability and maintainability.
* **Docstring:** A docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.

**Example Usage:**

```python
applicant_data = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 3,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1000,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (Rejected - due to expense relative to income)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True]
```


This revised function provides a more robust and practical implementation of the credit application decision tree, while also addressing the requested format for the `nodes` list and incorporating more realistic threshold values. Remember that a real-world model would require training on real data to determine optimal thresholds and potentially a more complex tree structure.
