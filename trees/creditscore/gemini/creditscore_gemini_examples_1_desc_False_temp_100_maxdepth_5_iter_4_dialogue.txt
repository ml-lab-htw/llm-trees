This function directly implements the hypothetical decision tree logic outlined in my previous response, mapping it to the specified feature names and target variable encoding.  It now includes the `nodes` list to track the truth values of the inner node conditions.  Remember this is still a hypothetical example;  a real-world model needs training on real data.
