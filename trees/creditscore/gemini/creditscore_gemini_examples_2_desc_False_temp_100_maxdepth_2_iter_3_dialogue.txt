  Predicts credit application acceptance based on applicant features.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the applicant's features.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for
    the inner nodes of the decision tree.

**Explanation:**

* **Decision Tree Structure:**  This function represents a decision tree with a depth of 2. 
    * **Root Node:**  `'Derogatory.reports' <= 1` - This splits applicants based on their credit history, as a high number of derogatory reports is a major red flag.
    * **Left Child:**  `'Income.per.dependent' >= 4` - For applicants with good credit history, this further assesses their financial stability. Higher income per dependent likely indicates a stronger ability to repay.
    * **Right Child:** No further split for applicants with higher derogatory reports (likely rejected regardless of other factors). 

* **Threshold Selection:**
    * **`Derogatory.reports' <= 1`**: A common threshold in credit risk assessment is to consider applicants with 2 or more derogatory reports as higher risk.
    * **`'Income.per.dependent' >= 4`**:  This is an assumption and would ideally be determined from data analysis or domain knowledge. A higher threshold might be appropriate depending on the cost of living and average income levels.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data-Driven Optimization:** This decision tree is based on assumptions about feature importance and threshold values. To build a more accurate and reliable model, you would need to train it on a real dataset using a machine learning library like scikit-learn. 
* **Feature Importance:** In a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined through feature engineering and selection techniques (e.g., using feature importance scores from a trained model).
* **Threshold Optimization:**  The optimal threshold values for splitting should be determined by analyzing the data distribution and evaluating the model's performance on a validation set.

Please provide example data and your desired feature importance metric if you'd like me to help you build a more data-driven decision tree!
