```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree

    # Using Income.per.dependent with a threshold of 6.  This is an arbitrary choice, as in the previous response.
    # A real model would learn this threshold from data.
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 6

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Accepted if income per dependent is greater than 6
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected otherwise

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Important Considerations (repeated from previous response):**

* **Arbitrary Threshold:** The threshold of '6' for "Income.per.dependent" is arbitrary. A real decision tree model would learn the optimal threshold from training data.
* **Simplified Logic:** This function represents a highly simplified credit approval process.  Real-world credit scoring uses much more complex logic.
* **Need for Data:** To create a genuinely useful model, you'll need a dataset of past credit applications with features and outcomes (accepted/rejected).  This allows for training a model that learns relevant thresholds and feature importance from the data.  The provided function is only a structural illustration.


This updated response provides the Python function in the requested format, adhering to the specified feature names and target variable encoding. It uses a single node based on "Income.per.dependent" due to the depth-1 constraint. Remember that without training data, the chosen threshold and feature are arbitrary and likely not representative of a real-world credit application decision process.
