I can help you create a Python function for a decision tree classifier based on your provided features and desired format. 

**Important Note:** Since I don't have access to training data to learn the actual thresholds and decision rules, I'll be creating a sample decision tree structure. You can (and should) modify the thresholds and feature choices based on your domain expertise and what you know about the relationship between these features and credit approval.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts credit application approval based on input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and 
               a list of truth values for each inner node.
    """

    nodes = 5 * [None]  

    # Example Decision Tree Structure (modify based on your understanding)
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1  # More than 1 derogatory report
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] < 4  # Low income per dependent
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 2000  # High credit card expenses
    nodes[3] = X['Own.home'] == 0  # Doesn't own a home
    nodes[4] = X['Age'] < 25  # Applicant is young

    if nodes[0]: 
        prediction = 0  # Likely rejected if more than 1 derogatory report 
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected: Low income and high expenses 
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Approved: Low income but manageable expenses
        else: 
            if nodes[3] and nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected: Young, doesn't own home
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Approved: Higher income, other factors favorable 

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage
example_applicant = {
    'Age': 30, 
    'Income.per.dependent': 6,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1500, 
    'Own.home': 1, 
    'Self.employed': 0, 
    'Derogatory.reports': 0 
}

prediction, node_values = predict(example_applicant)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {node_values}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict(X)` Function:** Takes a dictionary `X` representing the features of a single applicant.
2. **`nodes` List:** Stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. 
3. **Decision Tree Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree's logic. I've used placeholder thresholds (e.g., `Income.per.dependent < 4`, `Monthly.credit.card.exp > 2000`) - you'll need to adjust these based on your knowledge of the data.
4. **Return Values:** The function returns the `prediction` (0 for rejected, 1 for approved) and the `nodes` list.

**Key Improvements Needed:**

* **Threshold Optimization:** Replace my example thresholds with values that make sense for your data.  
* **Feature Selection:**  I've used all the features, but you might get better results by focusing on the most important ones for credit risk.
* **Tree Depth & Complexity:** Consider if you need a deeper tree (more complex decisions) or if a simpler tree is sufficient. 

Remember that this is a simplified example. To create a robust decision tree model, you should train it on real data using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and tune the hyperparameters for optimal performance.
