```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 0.5 * X["Income.per.dependent"]

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Denied (low income, many derogatory reports)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Denied (low income, few derogatory reports - still risky)
    else:  # Income per dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[2]: # Derogatory reports > 0
            if nodes[3]:  # High credit card expenses relative to income
                prediction = 0  # Denied (high expenses despite decent income)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Approved (derogatory reports present, but manageable expenses)
        else:  # No derogatory reports
            prediction = 1  # Approved (good income, no derogatory reports)

    return prediction, nodes

```


This Python function represents the hypothetical decision tree outlined previously. It takes a dictionary `X` representing a single application (with feature keys exactly as specified) and returns the prediction (0 for denied, 1 for approved) along with the truth values of the inner nodes.  Remember, this tree is hypothetical and would need to be trained on real data for accurate predictions.
