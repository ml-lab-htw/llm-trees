**Explanation:**

The decision tree is structured as a series of nested `if-else` conditions representing the nodes. 

* **Nodes:**  Each `nodes[i]` corresponds to a decision node in the tree. 
   - `nodes[0]` checks if  `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 5.5.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1.5.
   - ... and so on.
* **Thresholds:** I've included placeholder thresholds for 'Monthly.credit.card.exp'.  You'll need to analyze your data to determine the most appropriate values.
* **Leaf Nodes (Predictions):** The `prediction` values (0 or 1) at the end of each branch represent whether the application is accepted (1) or rejected (0) based on the path taken through the tree.

**To use the function:**

1. **Pass a dictionary:** Provide a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (exactly as specified) and the values are the feature values for a single application.

   Example:
   ```python
   application_data = {
       'Age': 28, 
       'Income.per.dependent': 3.2, 
       'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 650, 
       'Own.home': 0, 
       'Self.employed': 1, 
       'Derogatory.reports': 0 
   }
   prediction, nodes = predict(application_data) 
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
   print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
   ```

2. **Get the prediction:** The function returns the `prediction` (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values (0 or 1) for each inner node condition. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:** I've created a plausible decision tree structure, but you **must** replace the placeholder thresholds with values based on analysis of your actual data.
* **Model Evaluation:**  Once you have a tree with finalized thresholds, you need to evaluate its performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on a separate test dataset to ensure it generalizes well. 
* **Tree Complexity:** This example is a relatively simple tree. You might need a deeper or more complex tree depending on the complexity of the relationships in your data.
