**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Threshold:** The 30% expense-to-income ratio is now explicitly defined.
* **Simplified Branching:** The logic for derogatory reports is simplified. If any reports exist, the application is rejected (within this limited depth tree).  A more complex tree could further analyze income in this branch.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to use the function and interpret the results.
* **Type Hinting:** Included type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code readability and maintainability.

This improved function provides a clear and functional implementation of the decision tree based on the given constraints and assumptions.  Remember that with real-world data, you should use machine learning libraries to train a more robust model.
