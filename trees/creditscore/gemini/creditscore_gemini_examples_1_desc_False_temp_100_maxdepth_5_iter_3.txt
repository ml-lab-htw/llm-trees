**Explanation and Justification:**

The generated decision tree utilizes a maximum depth of 5 and incorporates the provided features to make a prediction about credit application acceptance. The logic within the tree is designed to reflect common credit risk assessment practices, although it's essential to remember this tree is **not** trained on real data.

Here's a breakdown of the decision-making process:

1. **Derogatory Reports (Root Node):** The most crucial factor is the presence of derogatory reports.  If present, it significantly increases the likelihood of rejection.

2. **Age:**  Younger applicants with derogatory reports are considered higher risk.

3. **Income per Dependent:**  Lower income, especially combined with derogatory reports and young age, further increases the risk.

4. **Home Ownership:** Owning a home is considered a positive factor, but it might not outweigh the negative impact of derogatory reports.

5. **Monthly Credit Card Expenses:**  High credit card spending, in conjunction with other risk factors, is a negative indicator.

The tree structure and the conditions used are designed to create a plausible decision process for credit application evaluation.  However, without training on real-world data, the performance and accuracy of this tree are unknown. It serves as a demonstration of how a decision tree can be structured using given features and a target variable, incorporating some intuitive domain knowledge about credit risk.  A real-world credit application decision tree would require training on a large dataset to achieve acceptable performance.
