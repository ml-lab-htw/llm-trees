**Key Changes and Improvements:**

* **Correct Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The nested `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to follow.
* **Realistic Thresholds:**  Includes example thresholds (e.g., 0.6 for credit card expenses relative to income, 2.5 for income per dependent, age 25).  These should be adjusted based on actual data analysis.
* **Handles Missing Branches:** The original tree lacked an `else` condition for the top-level split. This has been addressed with a final `else` and default prediction.
* **Returns Used Nodes:** The `nodes` list now only includes the truth values for the conditions actually evaluated in the path to the prediction. This was a requirement of the prompt and was not present in the initial response.

This improved function accurately implements the hypothetical decision tree logic and is formatted to match the requested example, including the return of truth values for the inner nodes.  Remember to replace the example feature values with your own data and refine the thresholds using a suitable dataset and training process.
