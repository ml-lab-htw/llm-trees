Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree as per your specifications. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features with the exact keys provided. It returns a single prediction (`0` for application denied, `1` for application approved) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions) of the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0  # Check if number of derogatory reports is greater than 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5  # Check if income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Application Denied
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Application Denied
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Application Approved

    # Convert boolean values in nodes list to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(condition) for condition in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:**
  - `nodes = [None] * 2` initializes a list to hold the truth values of the two inner nodes (conditions) in our decision tree.

- **First Condition (`nodes[0]`):**
  - `nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0`
  - Checks if the applicant has more than 0 derogatory reports.
    - If **True** (`1`), the applicant has derogatory reports, and the application is **Denied**.
    - If **False** (`0`), the applicant has no derogatory reports, and we proceed to the next condition.

- **Second Condition (`nodes[1]`):**
  - `nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5`
  - Evaluated only if the first condition is **False**.
  - Checks if the applicant's income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5.
    - If **True** (`1`), the income per dependent is low, and the application is **Denied**.
    - If **False** (`0`), the income per dependent is sufficient, and the application is **Approved**.

- **Prediction:**
  - The `prediction` variable holds the final decision.
    - `0` indicates the application is **Denied**.
    - `1` indicates the application is **Approved**.

- **Return Values:**
  - The function returns:
    - `prediction`: The final decision based on the decision tree.
    - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values (`1` or `0`) of the conditions in the order they were evaluated.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function with an example input:

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age":  thirty-five,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Application Approved" if prediction == 1 else "Application Denied")
print("Node Conditions Satisfied:", nodes)
```

**Note on Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- Make sure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature keys:
  - `"Age"`
  - `"Income.per.dependent"`
  - `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
  - `"Own.home"` (1 for yes, 0 for no)
  - `"Self.employed"` (1 for yes, 0 for no)
  - `"Derogatory.reports"` (integer values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
- The target variable encoding:
  - `0`: Application **Denied**
  - `1`: Application **Approved**

**Decision Tree Representation:**

The decision tree implemented in the function is as follows:

```
|--- Derogatory.reports > 0
|    |--- Prediction: 0 (Application Denied)
|--- Derogatory.reports <= 0
|    |--- Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
|    |    |--- Prediction: 0 (Application Denied)
|    |--- Income.per.dependent > 4.5
|    |    |--- Prediction: 1 (Application Approved)
```

- **First Split on `Derogatory.reports`:**
  - If the applicant has any derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports` > 0), the application is **Denied**.

- **Second Split on `Income.per.dependent`:**
  - For applicants with no derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports` ≤ 0), we check `Income.per.dependent`:
    - If `Income.per.dependent` ≤ 4.5, the application is **Denied**.
    - If `Income.per.dependent` > 4.5, the application is **Approved**.

**Converting Conditions to Integers:**

- Before returning, we convert the boolean values in `nodes` to integers (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`) to match your requirement.

**Threshold Values:**

- The threshold values used (`Derogatory.reports` > 0 and `Income.per.dependent` ≤ 4.5) are filled with meaningful values based on the importance of the features:
  - **`Derogatory.reports` > 0**: Any derogatory reports negatively impact the application.
  - **`Income.per.dependent` ≤ 4.5**: Indicates lower income per dependent, which may affect the ability to repay.
