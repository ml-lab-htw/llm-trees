Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0]*3
    nodes[0] = int(X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 5.0)
    nodes[2] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

This function follows the decision tree logic based on the provided features and their exact keys:

1. **Initialize the Nodes List:**
   - `nodes = [0]*3` creates a list of three elements initialized to `0`.

2. **Evaluate Conditions for Inner Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the applicant has any derogatory reports.
     ```python
     nodes[0] = int(X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0)
     ```
     - If `Derogatory.reports` is greater than `0`, `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition satisfied).
     - Else, `nodes[0]` is `0`.

   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the income per dependent is greater than or equal to `5.0`.
     ```python
     nodes[1] = int(X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 5.0)
     ```
     - If `Income.per.dependent` is greater than or equal to `5.0`, `nodes[1]` is `1`.
     - Else, `nodes[1]` is `0`.

   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the applicant owns a home.
     ```python
     nodes[2] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1)
     ```
     - Since `Own.home` is encoded as `1` for yes and `0` for no:
       - If `Own.home` is `1`, `nodes[2]` is `1`.
       - Else, `nodes[2]` is `0`.

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - If the applicant has any derogatory reports (`nodes[0] == 1`), the application is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
   - Else, check the income per dependent:
     - If `nodes[1] == 1` (income per dependent â‰¥ 5.0), the application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else, check if the applicant owns a home:
       - If `nodes[2] == 1` (owns a home), the application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
       - Else, the application is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The function returns the `prediction` and the list of `nodes` truth values.
     ```python
     return prediction, nodes
     ```

**Usage Example:**

Given an applicant's data in a dictionary `X` with the exact keys:

```python
# Applicant data example
X = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 1,             # 1 for yes, 0 for no
    'Self.employed': 0,        # 1 for yes, 0 for no
    'Derogatory.reports': 0    # Number of derogatory reports
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**
```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0, 1]
```

This means:
- The applicant has no derogatory reports (`nodes[0] = 0`).
- Income per dependent is less than `5.0` (`nodes[1] = 0`).
- The applicant owns a home (`nodes[2] = 1`).
- Therefore, the application is **Accepted**.
