```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Usage:** The function now correctly uses `X["Income.per.dependent"]` and `X["Derogatory.reports"]` as specified.

2. **Thresholds:**  Meaningful thresholds are included (4 for income per dependent, 0 and 2 for derogatory reports, based on different income levels).  These are still examples;  optimal thresholds would be learned from data.

3. **Node List:** The `nodes` list is populated with the truth values of the conditions at each node as required.  This allows tracking the decision path.

4. **Clarity and Comments:**  Comments are added to improve readability and explain the logic behind the thresholds and branches.

5. **Type Hinting:**  Included type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code clarity and maintainability.


**How to use the function:**

```python
example_applicant = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 3,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_applicant)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Predicted outcome (0 or 1)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Truth values of decision nodes.
```


This improved version fulfills the requirements of the prompt, providing both a prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes. It's important to reiterate that the chosen thresholds are illustrative; training on real data is crucial for building an effective credit application prediction model.
