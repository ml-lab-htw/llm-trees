Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. This function takes a dictionary `X` of features and returns a single prediction (`0` for "Not Accepted" and `1` for "Accepted") along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the `nodes` list is `True` (`1`) if the condition at that node is satisfied and `False` (`0`) otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the number of derogatory reports is greater than 0
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    if nodes[0]:
        # If there are derogatory reports, the application is Not Accepted
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.0
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:
            # If income per dependent is low, the application is Not Accepted
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the applicant owns a home
            nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1  # 1 = Yes, 0 = No
            if nodes[2]:
                # If the applicant owns a home, the application is Accepted
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If the applicant does not own a home, the application is Not Accepted
                prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `"Derogatory.reports"` > 0.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `"Income.per.dependent"` <= 4.0.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `"Own.home"` == 1 (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **Node 0:**  
     - If the applicant has more than 0 derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is `True`), **prediction is `0`** (Not Accepted).
     - Else, proceed to Node 1.
  2. **Node 1:**  
     - If the income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.0 (`nodes[1]` is `True`), **prediction is `0`** (Not Accepted).
     - Else, proceed to Node 2.
  3. **Node 2:**  
     - If the applicant owns a home (`nodes[2]` is `True`), **prediction is `1`** (Accepted).
     - Else, **prediction is `0`** (Not Accepted).

**Thresholds and Conditions:**

- **Derogatory Reports Threshold:**  
  - More than `0` derogatory reports lead to rejection.
- **Income per Dependent Threshold:**  
  - Income per dependent less than or equal to `4.0` is considered insufficient.
- **Own Home Condition:**  
  - Owning a home (`Own.home` == `1`) is a positive factor leading to acceptance.

**Feature Keys Used (with Exact Spelling):**

- `"Age"`
- `"Income.per.dependent"`
- `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
- `"Own.home"`
- `"Self.employed"`
- `"Derogatory.reports"`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: Application Not Accepted
- `1`: Application Accepted

**Example Usage:**

Here's how you might use this function:

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [False, False, True]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `False` because the applicant has `0` derogatory reports.
- `nodes[1]` is `False` because `Income.per.dependent` > `4.0`.
- `nodes[2]` is `True` because the applicant owns a home.
- The prediction is `1` (Accepted).

**Note:** This function follows the decision tree structure and uses the exact feature keys as specified.
