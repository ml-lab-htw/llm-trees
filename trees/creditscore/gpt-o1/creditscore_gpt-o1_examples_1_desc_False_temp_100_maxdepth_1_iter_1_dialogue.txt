```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation**:

- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the condition `Derogatory.reports <= 0`.
  - If this condition is **True** (i.e., the applicant has **zero** derogatory reports), `nodes[0]` is set to `True` (or `1` when converted to an integer).
  - If the condition is **False** (i.e., the applicant has **one or more** derogatory reports), `nodes[0]` is set to `False` (or `0` when converted to an integer).
- The **prediction** is determined based on the value of `nodes[0]`:
  - If `nodes[0]` is **True** (`1`), the prediction is `1`, meaning the credit application is **accepted**.
  - If `nodes[0]` is **False** (`0`), the prediction is `0`, meaning the credit application is **rejected**.
- The function returns a tuple containing the **prediction** and the list of **nodes**.

**Usage Example**:

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Node values: {nodes}")
```

**Output**:
```
Prediction: Accepted
Node values: [True]
```
