Certainly! Based on the most important feature, **Derogatory.reports**, we can create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 to predict whether a credit application is accepted (1) or not (0).

**Decision Tree:**

```
|--- Derogatory.reports <= 0
||--- class: accept (1)
|--- Derogatory.reports > 0
||--- class: reject (0)
```

This tree implies:

- If the applicant has **no derogatory reports** (<= 0), the application is **accepted**.
- If the applicant has **one or more derogatory reports** (> 0), the application is **rejected**.

Here is the Python function following your specified format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0  # Evaluate the condition at the root node

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Accept the application
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Reject the application
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** stores the truth value of the condition `X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0`.
  - It is `True` (or `1`) if the applicant has no derogatory reports.
  - It is `False` (or `0`) if the applicant has one or more derogatory reports.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = no, 1 = yes).
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have an applicant with the following features:

```python
applicant = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [True]
```

In this example:

- The applicant has `0` derogatory reports.
- The condition `Derogatory.reports <= 0` is `True`.
- The application is **accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
