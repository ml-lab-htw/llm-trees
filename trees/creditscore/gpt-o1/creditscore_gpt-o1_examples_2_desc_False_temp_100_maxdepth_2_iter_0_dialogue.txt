Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier you've described. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the exact feature keys you've specified and returns a single prediction (0 for "no" and 1 for "yes") along with a list representing the truth values (0 or 1) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Reject

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features (with exact keys):**
  - `"Age"`
  - `"Income.per.dependent"`
  - `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
  - `"Own.home"`
  - `"Self.employed"`
  - `"Derogatory.reports"`

- **Target Variable:**
  - `0` = Application for credit **not** accepted (Reject)
  - `1` = Application for credit accepted (Accept)

**Function Details:**

- **Initialize Nodes:**
  ```python
  nodes = 2 * [None]
  ```
  - Creates a list `nodes` with two `None` elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

- **First Condition (Root Node):**
  ```python
  nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0)
  ```
  - Checks if the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 0.
  - If the condition is satisfied, `nodes[0]` is set to `1`, else `0`.

- **Second Condition (Level 1 Node):**
  ```python
  nodes[1] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5)
  ```
  - Checks if the income per dependent is greater than 5.
  - If the condition is satisfied, `nodes[1]` is set to `1`, else `0`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  ```python
  if nodes[0]:
      if nodes[1]:
          prediction = 1  # Accept
      else:
          prediction = 0  # Reject
  else:
      prediction = 0  # Reject
  ```
  - If the applicant has **no derogatory reports** (`nodes[0] == 1`):
    - **And** income per dependent is **greater than 5** (`nodes[1] == 1`):
      - **Prediction:** `1` (Accept)
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Reject)
  - Else (applicant has derogatory reports):
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Reject)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `Prediction: 1` means the application is **accepted**.
  - `Nodes: [1, 1]` shows that:
    - `nodes[0] == 1`: The applicant has no derogatory reports.
    - `nodes[1] == 1`: The applicant's income per dependent is greater than 5.

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the feature keys and target variable encoding you've provided.
- The thresholds used (`<= 0` for `"Derogatory.reports"` and `> 5` for `"Income.per.dependent"`) are based on meaningful values that separate applicants likely to be accepted from those likely to be rejected.
- The list `nodes` provides insight into which conditions were met during the prediction process:
  - Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied, or `0` otherwise.
  - This can help in understanding the decision path for each prediction.

Feel free to test this function with different applicant data or adjust the thresholds as needed!
