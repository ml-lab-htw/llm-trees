Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree you've provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input and returns a prediction (0 for "Credit Denied", 1 for "Credit Accepted") along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Node 0: Derogatory.reports <= 0
    nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        nodes[1] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.0)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Application Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application Denied
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated
        prediction = 0  # Application Denied
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the applicant has **no derogatory reports**.
  - `nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0)`
    - Sets `nodes[0]` to `1` if the condition is satisfied (no derogatory reports), otherwise `0`.

- **Node 1:** Evaluated only if **Node 0** condition is satisfied.
  - Checks if the applicant's **Income per dependent** is **greater than 3.0**.
    - `nodes[1] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.0)`
    - Sets `nodes[1]` to `1` if income per dependent is sufficient, otherwise `0`.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (no derogatory reports):
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1` (sufficient income per dependent):
      - `prediction = 1` (Credit Accepted)
    - Else:
      - `prediction = 0` (Credit Denied)
  - Else:
    - `prediction = 0` (Credit Denied)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 1,  # 1 = yes
    "Self.employed": 0,  # 0 = no
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Credit Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Credit Denied")
print("Nodes Traversed:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Credit Accepted
Nodes Traversed: [1, 1]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the keys in your input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature names provided:

- `"Age"`
- `"Income.per.dependent"`
- `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
- `"Own.home"`
- `"Self.employed"`
- `"Derogatory.reports"`

**Thresholds Used:**

- **Derogatory.reports <= 0:** Checks for no derogatory reports.
- **Income.per.dependent > 3.0:** Assumes that an income per dependent above 3.0 (in thousands of dollars) is sufficient.

Feel free to adjust the thresholds to better suit your data if needed.
