Sure! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree as specified. It returns the prediction (`0` for "Not Accepted", `1` for "Accepted") and a list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list for 4 inner nodes

    # Node 0: Derogatory.reports > 0
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If the applicant has any derogatory reports
        prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    else:
        # Node 1: Income.per.dependent <= 2.5
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 2.5
        if nodes[1]:
            # If income per dependent is less than or equal to 2.5
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
        else:
            # Node 2: Age <= 21
            nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 21
            if nodes[2]:
                # If applicant is 21 years old or younger
                prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
            else:
                # Node 3: Own.home == 1 (Yes)
                nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
                if nodes[3]:
                    # If the applicant owns a home
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    # If the applicant does not own a home
                    prediction = 0  # Not Accepted

    # Convert boolean conditions to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age":  thirty_two,
    "Income.per.dependent": 3.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Not Accepted")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**  
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates the condition `Derogatory.reports > 0`.  
    - `1` if the applicant has any derogatory reports.  
    - `0` if the applicant has no derogatory reports.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates `Income.per.dependent <= 2.5` (only if `nodes[0] == 0`).  
    - `1` if income per dependent is low (less than or equal to 2.5).  
  - `nodes[2]`: Evaluates `Age <= 21` (only if `nodes[1] == 0`).  
    - `1` if the applicant is 21 years old or younger.
  - `nodes[3]`: Evaluates `Own.home == 1` (only if `nodes[2] == 0`).  
    - `1` if the applicant owns a home.

- **Decision Logic:**  
  1. **Derogatory Reports:**  
     - If `nodes[0] == 1`, the application is **Not Accepted**.
  2. **Income per Dependent:**  
     - If `nodes[1] == 1`, the application is **Not Accepted**.
  3. **Age:**  
     - If `nodes[2] == 1`, the application is **Not Accepted**.
  4. **Own Home:**  
     - If `nodes[3] == 1`, the application is **Accepted**.
     - Else, the application is **Not Accepted**.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the feature values in the input dictionary `X` use the exact keys and encodings as specified:
  - **Age**: Integer representing age in years.
  - **Income.per.dependent**: Float between 1.5 and 10.
  - **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Float or integer representing monthly expenses in dollars.
  - **Own.home**: `1` for yes, `0` for no.
  - **Self.employed**: `1` for yes, `0` for no.
  - **Derogatory.reports**: Integer (possible values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `7`).

**Testing with Different Applicants:**

- **Applicant with Derogatory Reports:**

  ```python
  applicant = {
      "Age": 40,
      "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
      "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
      "Own.home": 1,
      "Self.employed": 0,
      "Derogatory.reports": 1
  }
  # Prediction: Not Accepted
  ```

- **Applicant with Low Income per Dependent:**

  ```python
  applicant = {
      "Age": 30,
      "Income.per.dependent": 2.0,
      "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
      "Own.home": 0,
      "Self.employed": 1,
      "Derogatory.reports": 0
  }
  # Prediction: Not Accepted
  ```

- **Young Applicant without Homeownership:**

  ```python
  applicant = {
      "Age": 20,
      "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
      "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 400,
      "Own.home": 0,
      "Self.employed": 0,
      "Derogatory.reports": 0
  }
  # Prediction: Not Accepted
  ```

- **Applicant Who Meets All Criteria:**

  ```python
  applicant = {
      "Age": 35,
      "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
      "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
      "Own.home": 1,
      "Self.employed": 0,
      "Derogatory.reports": 0
  }
  # Prediction: Accepted
  ```

**Final Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic with a maximum depth of **5**, as requested.
- It uses the most significant features affecting the credit acceptance decision.
- Be sure to provide all necessary feature values when calling the `predict` function.
