Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the requirements you've provided, here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the exact feature keys and returns a prediction (0 = Reject, 1 = Accept) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list of 3 elements for the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Derogatory.reports <= 0
    nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Income.per.dependent > 5.0
        nodes[1] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Reject
        nodes[2] = None  # No node at this path
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # No node at this path
        # Node 2: Own.home == 1
        nodes[2] = int(X["Own.home"] == 1)
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Reject

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Decision Tree:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 0.
  - If **Yes** (`Derogatory.reports <= 0`):
    - **Node 1:** Checks if the income per dependent is greater than 5.0.
      - If **Yes** (`Income.per.dependent > 5.0`):
        - **Prediction:** Accept the application (`prediction = 1`)
      - If **No** (`Income.per.dependent <= 5.0`):
        - **Prediction:** Reject the application (`prediction = 0`)
    - **Node 2:** Not used in this path (`nodes[2] = None`)
  - If **No** (`Derogatory.reports > 0`):
    - **Node 1:** Not used in this path (`nodes[1] = None`)
    - **Node 2:** Checks if the applicant owns a home (`Own.home == 1`).
      - If **Yes** (`Own.home == 1`):
        - **Prediction:** Accept the application (`prediction = 1`)
      - If **No** (`Own.home == 0`):
        - **Prediction:** Reject the application (`prediction = 0`)

**Note on the Nodes List:**

- `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `Derogatory.reports <= 0`.
- `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `Income.per.dependent > 5.0` when `nodes[0]` is `1`; otherwise, it's `None`.
- `nodes[2]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `Own.home == 1` when `nodes[0]` is `0`; otherwise, it's `None`.
- Each entry in `nodes` is `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` if not satisfied, and `None` if the node is not reached in that path.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Accept" if prediction == 1 else "Reject")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Accept
Nodes: [1, 1, None]
```

In this example:

- `Derogatory.reports` is `0`, so `nodes[0] = 1`.
- `Income.per.dependent` is `6.0`, so `nodes[1] = 1` since it's greater than `5.0`.
- Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, `nodes[2]` is `None`.
- The application is **Accepted**.

**Important Notes:**

- Please ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the keys with exact spelling as given.
- The values should be encoded or formatted as specified in the feature descriptions.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic up to a maximum depth of 3.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs to see how the prediction and nodes change based on the conditions.
