Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the specific feature names provided, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5.0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the number of derogatory reports is greater than 0.
  - If **True** (nodes[0] is `True`), the applicant has derogatory reports, and the application is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If **False** (nodes[0] is `False`), the applicant has no derogatory reports, and we proceed to the next condition.
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if the income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5.0.
  - If **True** (nodes[1] is `True`), the applicant has sufficient income per dependent, and the application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If **False** (nodes[1] is `False`), the applicant has insufficient income per dependent, and the application is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).

**Note on Feature Names and Values:**

- Ensure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature names:
  - `"Age"`
  - `"Income.per.dependent"`
  - `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
  - `"Own.home"`
  - `"Self.employed"`
  - `"Derogatory.reports"`
- Target variable encoding:
  - `0` = Application **Rejected**
  - `1` = Application **Accepted**

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Decision Path: {nodes}")
```

This function complies with the specified format and utilizes meaningful threshold values based on the provided feature ranges.
