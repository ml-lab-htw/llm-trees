Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0 else 0
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.0 else 0
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['Own.home'] == 1 else 0
    nodes[3] = 1 if X['Self.employed'] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Application Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Application Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Application Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Application Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Application Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree.
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `'Derogatory.reports'` is greater than 0.
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `'Income.per.dependent'` is less than or equal to 3.0.
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `'Own.home'` equals 1 (Yes).
    - `nodes[3]`: Checks if `'Self.employed'` equals 1 (Yes).

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
    - If there are any derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is 1), the application is **rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If no derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is 0):
        - If income per dependent is less than or equal to 3.0 (`nodes[1]` is 1), the application is **rejected**.
        - If income per dependent is greater than 3.0 (`nodes[1]` is 0):
            - If the applicant owns a home (`nodes[2]` is 1), the application is **accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
            - If the applicant does not own a home (`nodes[2]` is 0):
                - If the applicant is self-employed (`nodes[3]` is 1), the application is **rejected**.
                - If the applicant is not self-employed (`nodes[3]` is 0), the application is **accepted**.

- **Return Value:** The function returns the `prediction` (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of `nodes` indicating the path taken in the decision tree.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected")
print("Decision Path:", nodes)
```

**Note:** Ensure that the feature values in the input dictionary `X` match the exact keys provided and adhere to the specified encoding:

- `'Own.home'`: 1 for Yes, 0 for No
- `'Self.employed'`: 1 for Yes, 0 for No
- `'Derogatory.reports'`: Can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7
- `'Income.per.dependent'`: Numeric value between 1.5 to 10
