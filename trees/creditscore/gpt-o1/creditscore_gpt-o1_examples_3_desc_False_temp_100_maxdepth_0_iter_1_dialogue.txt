Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the specified features, here is the Python function that returns a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Features:**

- **Age**: Age in years.
- **Income.per.dependent**: Income per dependent (ranges from 1.5 to 10).
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Monthly credit card expenses ($).
- **Own.home**: Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed**: Self-employed status (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports**: Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

**Target variable:**

- **Application for credit is accepted or not** (0 = no, 1 = yes).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0 else 0
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 5.0 else 0
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['Own.home'] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accept
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Reject
    return prediction, nodes
```

---

**Explanation:**

1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if the applicant has any derogatory reports.
   - **Condition**: `Derogatory.reports > 0`
   - **Interpretation**:
     - If `True` (`nodes[0] = 1`), the applicant has derogatory reports and the application is **Rejected**.
     - If `False` (`nodes[0] = 0`), move to the next condition.
   
2. **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): Checks the applicant's income per dependent.
   - **Condition**: `Income.per.dependent >= 5.0`
   - **Interpretation**:
     - If `True` (`nodes[1] = 1`), the applicant has sufficient income per dependent and the application is **Accepted**.
     - If `False` (`nodes[1] = 0`), move to the next condition.
   
3. **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): Checks if the applicant owns a home.
   - **Condition**: `Own.home == 1`
   - **Interpretation**:
     - If `True` (`nodes[2] = 1`), homeownership indicates financial stability, and the application is **Accepted**.
     - If `False` (`nodes[2] = 0`), the application is **Rejected**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example applicant data
X_example = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the result
print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

- **Interpretation of `nodes`:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: Applicant has **no** derogatory reports.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: Applicant's income per dependent is **less than $5.0K**.
  - `nodes[2] = 1`: Applicant **owns a home**.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys as specified (pay attention to spelling, case, and spaces).
- The function checks conditions in order of importance based on the decision tree.
- The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the conditions:
  - `1` if the condition is **True**.
  - `0` if the condition is **False**.
- The `prediction` variable represents the final decision:
  - `1` means the application is **Accepted**.
  - `0` means the application is **Rejected**.

**Thresholds Explanation:**

- **Derogatory.reports > 0**: Any derogatory reports lead to immediate rejection.
- **Income.per.dependent >= 5.0**: A threshold indicating sufficient income relative to dependents.
- **Own.home == 1**: Homeownership status where `1` represents owning a home.

Feel free to use this function and adjust the thresholds if needed based on further data analysis or specific lending criteria.
