**Features:**

- **Age:** Age in years.
- **Income.per.dependent:** Income per dependent (ranges from 1.5 to 10).
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp:** Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
- **Own.home:** Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed:** Self-employed status (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports:** Number of derogatory reports (possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

**Target Variable:**

- **application for credit is accepted or not:** (0 = no, 1 = yes)

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X["Own.home"] == 1)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 4.5)
    nodes[3] = int(X["Self.employed"] == 1)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the number of derogatory reports is greater than 0.
  - `nodes[0] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0)`
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if the applicant owns a home.
  - `nodes[1] = int(X["Own.home"] == 1)`
- **nodes[2]:** Checks if the income per dependent is greater than or equal to 4.5.
  - `nodes[2] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 4.5)`
- **nodes[3]:** Checks if the applicant is self-employed.
  - `nodes[3] = int(X["Self.employed"] == 1)`

The function evaluates the conditions in the decision tree and uses the `nodes` list to keep track of which conditions were met (1) or not met (0). The prediction is based on these conditions:

1. **If there are any derogatory reports (`nodes[0] == 1`):**
   - The application is **Not Accepted** (`prediction = 0`).
2. **Else, if the applicant owns a home (`nodes[1] == 1`):**
   - The application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
3. **Else, if income per dependent is at least 4.5 (`nodes[2] == 1`):**
   - The application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
4. **Else, if the applicant is self-employed (`nodes[3] == 1`):**
   - The application is **Not Accepted** (`prediction = 0`).
5. **Else:**
   - The application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 0,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Accepted'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes: [0, 0, 1, 0]
```

In this example:

- The applicant has **no derogatory reports** (`nodes[0] = 0`).
- Does **not own a home** (`nodes[1] = 0`).
- Has an income per dependent of **5.0**, which is **greater than 4.5** (`nodes[2] = 1`).
- Is **not self-employed** (`nodes[3] = 0`).

Based on the decision tree, the application is **Accepted**.

**Note:** This function follows the structure of the decision tree you provided and matches the format of your examples. Each condition corresponds to a node in the tree, and the `nodes` list keeps track of which conditions are met during the evaluation.
