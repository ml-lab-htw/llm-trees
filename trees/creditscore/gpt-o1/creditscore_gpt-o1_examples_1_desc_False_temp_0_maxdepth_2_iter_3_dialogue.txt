```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** More realistic thresholds are used (3.0 for income per dependent and varying number of derogatory reports based on income).
* **Correct Feature Names:** The provided feature names are used exactly.
* **Docstring:**  Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose.
* **Example Usage:** Added example usage to demonstrate how to call the function.
* **Node Truth Values:**  Returns the truth values of the inner nodes as requested.  This allows for greater interpretability and debugging.
* **Two Thresholds for Derogatory Reports:** Uses a different threshold for derogatory reports depending on the income level, making the decision logic more nuanced.


This refined function now accurately reflects the decision tree logic and provides the requested node truth values.  It also incorporates more realistic assumptions about how these features might influence a credit application decision. Remember that this is still a simplified example. A real-world model would be trained on data and likely use more sophisticated techniques.
