**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the number of derogatory reports is greater than 0.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the person owns a home (`Own.home` is 1 for "yes").
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the age is less than or equal to 25.
  - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $1000.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If there are any derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is **True** or `1`), the application is **rejected**.
  - If there are no derogatory reports:
    - If income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5 (`nodes[1]` is **True**), the application is **rejected**.
    - If income per dependent is greater than 4.5:
      - If the applicant owns a home (`nodes[2]` is **True**), the application is **accepted**.
      - If the applicant does not own a home:
        - If age is less than or equal to 25 (`nodes[3]` is **True**), the application is **rejected**.
        - If age is greater than 25:
          - If monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $1000 (`nodes[4]` is **True**), the application is **accepted**.
          - If monthly credit card expenses are greater than $1000, the application is **rejected**.

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The final decision for the application (0 = Reject, 1 = Accept).
  - `nodes`: A list of integers representing the truth values of the nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 800,
    "Own.home": 0,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Accept" if prediction == 1 else "Reject")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Accept
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```
