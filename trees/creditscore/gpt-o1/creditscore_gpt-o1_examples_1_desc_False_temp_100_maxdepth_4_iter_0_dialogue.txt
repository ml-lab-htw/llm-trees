The function returns a single prediction (`0` for reject, `1` for accept) and a list representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes.
    
    # Node 0: Derogatory.reports <= 0
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0 else 0
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Income.per.dependent > 5.0
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0 else 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accept
            nodes[2] = None  # Nodes not evaluated in this path are set to None.
            nodes[3] = None
        else:
            # Node 2: Own.home == 1
            nodes[2] = 1 if X["Own.home"] == 1 else 0  # Own.home: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accept
                nodes[3] = None
            else:
                # Node 3: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
                nodes[3] = 1 if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500 else 0
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Accept
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Reject
        nodes[1] = None
        nodes[2] = None
        nodes[3] = None

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node Conditions:**
  - **Node 0:** `Derogatory.reports <= 0`
    - Checks if the applicant has zero derogatory reports.
  - **Node 1:** `Income.per.dependent > 5.0`
    - Evaluated if Node 0 is satisfied. Checks if the income per dependent is greater than $5.0 (assuming the unit from the given range).
  - **Node 2:** `Own.home == 1`
    - Evaluated if Node 1 is not satisfied. Checks if the applicant owns a home. `Own.home` is encoded as `1` for Yes and `0` for No.
  - **Node 3:** `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500`
    - Evaluated if Node 2 is not satisfied. Checks if the monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $500.

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - Each entry corresponds to a node condition.
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
  - `None` if the node was not evaluated during prediction.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Features:**
  - `Age`: age in years.
  - `Income.per.dependent`: income per dependent (values range from 1.5 to 10).
  - `Monthly.credit.card.exp`: monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
  - `Own.home`: owning a home (`1` = Yes, `0` = No).
  - `Self.employed`: self-employed (`1` = Yes, `0` = No).
  - `Derogatory.reports`: number of derogatory reports (possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

- **Target Variable:**
  - **Prediction:** application for credit is accepted or not (`0` = No, `1` = Yes).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Sample applicant data
applicant = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)
print("Prediction:", "Accept" if prediction == 1 else "Reject")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Accept
Nodes: [1, 1, None, None]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - **Node 0:** `Derogatory.reports <= 0` is **True** (`1`).
  - **Node 1:** `Income.per.dependent > 5.0` is **True** (`1`).
  - **Node 2 and Node 3:** Not evaluated (`None`) since the path ended with Node 1.

**Thresholds and Values:**

- The thresholds (`5.0` for `Income.per.dependent` and `$500` for `Monthly.credit.card.exp`) are set based on meaningful midpoints within the provided ranges or common financial benchmarks.
  - **Income.per.dependent > 5.0:** Assumes that having more than $5,000 income per dependent is a strong indicator of financial stability.
  - **Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500:** Spending less than or equal to $500 on credit cards monthly may indicate responsible credit usage.

**Note:**

- In a real-world application, these thresholds should be determined through data analysis and model training on a relevant dataset.
- The function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with the correct keys and encodings.
- The `nodes` list helps trace the path taken in the decision tree for debugging or explanation purposes.
