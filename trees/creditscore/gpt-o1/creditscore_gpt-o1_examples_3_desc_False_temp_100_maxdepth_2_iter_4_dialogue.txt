```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    # Node 0: Check if Derogatory.reports > 2
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is True (Derogatory.reports > 2), predict Not Accepted (0)
        prediction = 0
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated in this path
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Income.per.dependent >= 5
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5 else 0
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is True, predict Accepted (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If Node 1 condition is False, predict Not Accepted (0)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Represents the truth value of the condition `Derogatory.reports > 2`.
  - `1` if the applicant has more than 2 derogatory reports.
  - `0` otherwise.

- **nodes[1]:** Represents the truth value of the condition `Income.per.dependent >= 5`.
  - Only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., the applicant has 2 or fewer derogatory reports).
  - `1` if the applicant's income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5.
  - `0` otherwise.

- **prediction:**
  - `1` indicates the credit application is **Accepted**.
  - `0` indicates the credit application is **Not Accepted**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
applicant_data = {
    "Age":  thirty-five,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data)

print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Not Accepted")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Note:** Make sure to replace the placeholder values in `applicant_data` with actual numerical values according to the feature descriptions provided.
