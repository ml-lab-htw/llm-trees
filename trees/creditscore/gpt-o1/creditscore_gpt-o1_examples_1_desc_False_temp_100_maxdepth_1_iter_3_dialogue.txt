Sure! Based on the decision tree and the provided features, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Initialize a list for truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Application is accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application is rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We have a decision tree of depth 1, which means there's only one decision node. Therefore, the `nodes` list has one element.
  
- **Condition:** The condition `X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0` checks if the applicant has zero derogatory reports.
  
  - If the condition is **True** (`nodes[0] = 1`), it means the applicant has no derogatory reports, and the application is **accepted**.
  
  - If the condition is **False** (`nodes[0] = 0`), it means the applicant has one or more derogatory reports, and the application is **rejected**.

- **Prediction:** The function returns a `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list indicating the truth value of the condition.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input where the applicant has no derogatory reports
applicant_1 = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Sample input where the applicant has derogatory reports
applicant_2 = {
    'Age': 45,
    'Income.per.dependent': 3,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 300,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 2
}

# Predict for applicant 1
prediction_1, nodes_1 = predict(applicant_1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction_1}, Nodes: {nodes_1}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True]

# Predict for applicant 2
prediction_2, nodes_2 = predict(applicant_2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction_2}, Nodes: {nodes_2}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the feature keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the specified keys, including case sensitivity and punctuation.
