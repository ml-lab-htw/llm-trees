Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the provided feature names and encodings, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Income.per.dependent'] > 4.5)
    nodes[2] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1)  # 1 = yes

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Decline Credit
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Approve Credit
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Approve Credit
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Decline Credit
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The list `nodes` keeps track of the truth values of each condition in the decision tree. A value of `1` means the condition is satisfied; `0` means it is not.
  
- **Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `'Derogatory.reports'` is greater than `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `'Income.per.dependent'` is greater than `4.5`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `'Own.home'` is `1` (which means "yes" in the feature encoding).
  
- **Decision Logic:**
  - If there are any derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is `1`), the credit application is declined (`prediction = 0`).
  - If no derogatory reports and income per dependent is high (`nodes[1]` is `1`), the credit application is approved (`prediction = 1`).
  - If income per dependent is not high but the applicant owns a home (`nodes[2]` is `1`), the credit application is approved (`prediction = 1`).
  - Otherwise, the credit application is declined (`prediction = 0`).

**Feature Names and Encodings:**

- **Feature Keys:** `['Age', 'Income.per.dependent', 'Monthly.credit.card.exp', 'Own.home', 'Self.employed', 'Derogatory.reports']`
- **Encodings:**
  - `'Own.home'`: `1` for "yes", `0` for "no"
  - `'Derogatory.reports'`: Numeric values (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `7`)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `'application for credit is accepted or not'`: `0` for "no", `1` for "yes"

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you might use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 1,  # Owns a home
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0, 1, 0]
```

In this example:

- There are no derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is `0`).
- The income per dependent is greater than `4.5` (`nodes[1]` is `1`).
- The function predicts that the credit application will be **approved** (`prediction = 1`).
