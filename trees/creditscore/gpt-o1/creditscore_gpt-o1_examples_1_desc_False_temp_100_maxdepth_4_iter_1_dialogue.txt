**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize the list of node conditions

    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1  # 1 represents 'Yes'
    nodes[3] = X["Self.employed"] == 1  # 1 represents 'Yes'

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 0 condition is True: Derogatory.reports > 0
        prediction = 0  # Application is Rejected
    else:
        # Node 0 condition is False: Derogatory.reports == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 1 condition is True: Income.per.dependent >= 5
            prediction = 1  # Application is Accepted
        else:
            # Node 1 condition is False: Income.per.dependent < 5
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 2 condition is True: Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Application is Accepted
            else:
                # Node 2 condition is False: Own.home == 0
                if nodes[3]:
                    # Node 3 condition is True: Self.employed == 1
                    prediction = 0  # Application is Rejected
                else:
                    # Node 3 condition is False: Self.employed == 0
                    prediction = 1  # Application is Accepted

    # Convert boolean conditions to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(condition) for condition in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Derogatory.reports"`: Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
  - `"Income.per.dependent"`: Income per dependent (ranging from 1.5 to 10)
  - `"Own.home"`: Owning a home (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - `"Self.employed"`: Self-employed status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the applicant has any derogatory reports.
    - `1` if `"Derogatory.reports" > 0`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5.
    - `1` if `"Income.per.dependent" >= 5`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the applicant owns a home.
    - `1` if `"Own.home" == 1`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the applicant is self-employed.
    - `1` if `"Self.employed" == 1`, else `0`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **Node 0**:
    - If the applicant has more than 0 derogatory reports (`nodes[0] == 1`), the application is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
  - **Node 1**:
    - If no derogatory reports (`nodes[0] == 0`) and income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5 (`nodes[1] == 1`), the application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Node 2**:
    - If income per dependent is less than 5 (`nodes[1] == 0`) and the applicant owns a home (`nodes[2] == 1`), the application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Node 3**:
    - If the applicant does not own a home (`nodes[2] == 0`) and is self-employed (`nodes[3] == 1`), the application is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If the applicant does not own a home and is not self-employed (`nodes[3] == 0`), the application is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The final decision (0 = Rejected, 1 = Accepted).
  - `nodes`: A list of integers representing the truth values of the conditions at each node (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example applicant data
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
    "Own.home": 0,  # Does not own a home
    "Self.employed": 1,  # Is self-employed
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the result
status = "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected"
print(f"Application Status: {status}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Application Status: Rejected
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0, 0, 1]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **Nodes Truth Values:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: Applicant has 0 derogatory reports.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: Income per dependent is less than 5.
  - `nodes[2] = 0`: Does not own a home.
  - `nodes[3] = 1`: Is self-employed.

- **Decision Path:**
  - Since `nodes[0] = 0`, we proceed to check `nodes[1]`.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`, so we check `nodes[2]`.
  - `nodes[2] = 0`, so we check `nodes[3]`.
  - `nodes[3] = 1`, leading to a **Rejected** application.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the exact keys and expected data types.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree provided, with conditions evaluated in the specified order.
- The `nodes` list provides transparency into which conditions were met during the decision process.

**Summary:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance based on the provided features. It evaluates each condition in the tree, tracks the truth values, and provides a final prediction along with the nodes' truth values for analysis or debugging purposes.
