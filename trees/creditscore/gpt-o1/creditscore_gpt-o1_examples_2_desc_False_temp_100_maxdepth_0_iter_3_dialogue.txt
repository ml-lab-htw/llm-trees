**Explanation:**

This function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the applicant's information with the exact feature keys provided. It uses a decision tree to determine whether the credit application should be accepted (`1`) or rejected (`0`), and returns both the prediction and a list `nodes` indicating which conditions were met (`True` or `False`).

**Node Conditions:**

1. **nodes[0]:** `X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0`
   - Checks if the applicant has any derogatory reports.
   - **True (1):** Applicant has derogatory reports (Reject).
   - **False (0):** No derogatory reports (Proceed to next condition).

2. **nodes[1]:** `X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3`
   - Assesses if the income per dependent is insufficient.
   - **True (1):** Income per dependent is less than or equal to 3 (Reject).
   - **False (0):** Income per dependent is greater than 3 (Proceed to next condition).

3. **nodes[2]:** `X["Own.home"] == 1`
   - Checks if the applicant owns a home.
   - **True (1):** Owns a home (Accept).
   - **False (0):** Does not own a home (Proceed to next condition).

4. **nodes[3]:** `X["Self.employed"] == 1`
   - Determines if the applicant is self-employed.
   - **True (1):** Self-employed (Accept).
   - **False (0):** Not self-employed (Reject).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected")
print("Nodes evaluation:", nodes)
```

**Output:**
```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes evaluation: [False, False, False, True]
```

**Note:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree provided, mapping each condition to the exact feature keys and their encodings.
- The `nodes` list records the truth value (`True` or `False`) of each condition in the decision tree.
- This allows for tracing the decision path taken for any given input.
