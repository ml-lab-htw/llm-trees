Certainly! Here's your decision tree formatted as a Python function, following the style of your examples. This function returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the list is `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Derogatory.reports > 0
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Derogatory.reports > 0 => Rejected
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
        nodes[1] = None  # Next node not evaluated
    else:
        # Derogatory.reports == 0
        # Node 1: Income.per.dependent >= 4.0
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 4.0 else 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Income.per.dependent >= 4.0 => Accepted
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            # Income.per.dependent < 4.0 => Rejected
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the applicant has any derogatory reports.
  - If `Derogatory.reports` > 0, then `nodes[0] = 1`, and the application is **rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If `Derogatory.reports` == 0, then `nodes[0] = 0`, and we proceed to Node 1.

- **Node 1:** Evaluated only if `Derogatory.reports` == 0.
  - Checks if the `Income.per.dependent` is greater than or equal to 4.0.
    - If `Income.per.dependent` >= 4.0, then `nodes[1] = 1`, and the application is **accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If `Income.per.dependent` < 4.0, then `nodes[1] = 0`, and the application is **rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If Node 1 is not evaluated (because `Derogatory.reports` > 0), then `nodes[1]` remains `None`.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you might use this function with an applicant's data:

```python
# Applicant data
applicant = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 3.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 600,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

# Output the result
print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Rejected
Nodes: [0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Node 0:** `Derogatory.reports` is 0, so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- **Node 1:** `Income.per.dependent` is 3.5, which is less than 4.0, so `nodes[1] = 0`.
- **Prediction:** Rejected (since `Income.per.dependent` < 4.0)

---

**Another Example:**

```python
# Applicant data
applicant = {
    'Age': 28,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 400,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

# Output the result
print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Node 0:** `Derogatory.reports` is 0, so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- **Node 1:** `Income.per.dependent` is 5.0, which is greater than or equal to 4.0, so `nodes[1] = 1`.
- **Prediction:** Accepted (since `Income.per.dependent` >= 4.0)

---

**Notes on the Function:**

- The function closely follows the decision tree structure you provided.
- It uses the exact feature keys you specified:
  - `'Age'`
  - `'Income.per.dependent'`
  - `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`
  - `'Own.home'`
  - `'Self.employed'`
  - `'Derogatory.reports'`
- The target variable is correctly encoded as:
  - `0`: Application for credit is **rejected**
  - `1`: Application for credit is **accepted**

**Thresholds Used:**

- **Derogatory.reports > 0:**
  - Any number greater than 0 in `Derogatory.reports` immediately results in a rejection.
- **Income.per.dependent >= 4.0:**
  - An `Income.per.dependent` of 4.0 or higher is considered acceptable if there are no derogatory reports.

**Rewriting the Conditions (For Clarity):**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Has derogatory reports?
    if X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0:
        nodes[0] = 1
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
        nodes[1] = None
    else:
        nodes[0] = 0
        # Node 1: Is income per dependent >= 4.0?
        if X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 4.0:
            nodes[1] = 1
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            nodes[1] = 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This version may be easier to read and understand. Each condition is checked sequentially, and the corresponding node values are set accordingly.

**Test the Function:**

You can test this function with various applicant data to see how the decision tree classifies different profiles. Remember to ensure that all feature keys match exactly, including case sensitivity and any periods or spaces.

**Feature Descriptions and Ranges:**

- **Age:** Age in years.
- **Income.per.dependent:** Income per dependent, ranging from 1.5 to 10.
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp:** Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
- **Own.home:** Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed:** Self-employed status (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports:** Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **0:** Application for credit is **rejected**.
- **1:** Application for credit is **accepted**.

Feel free to adjust the thresholds if you have specific values in mind or if you have more detailed data about the distribution of these features.
