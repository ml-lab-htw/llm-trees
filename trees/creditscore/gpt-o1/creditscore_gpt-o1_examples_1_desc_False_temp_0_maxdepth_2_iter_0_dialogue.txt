Key Improvements:

* **Type Handling:** The code now explicitly converts `'Income.per.dependent'` to a float and `'Derogatory.reports'` to an integer. This is crucial because these features might be read as strings from a data file, causing comparison errors.
* **Thresholds:**  Meaningful thresholds (4.0 for income and 0/2 for derogatory reports) are incorporated into the decision logic.  These values are based on the earlier assumptions and should be adjusted based on real data analysis.
* **Clearer Logic:** The code's structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Docstring:** A docstring is added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
* **Example Usage:**  The example demonstrates how to use the function with a sample feature dictionary.  Replace these example values with your actual data.


Remember to adapt the thresholds based on analysis of your specific credit application dataset. The current values are reasonable assumptions but may not be optimal for your use case.
