Certainly! Based on your specifications and the decision tree, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Application Accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application Rejected
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used**: `"Derogatory.reports"`
- **Threshold**: `0`

**Function Details:**

- **`nodes` List**:
  - `nodes[0]` stores the truth value of the condition `X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0`.
    - It will be `True` (or `1`) if the applicant has **no derogatory reports**.
    - It will be `False` (or `0`) if the applicant has **one or more derogatory reports**.

- **`prediction`**:
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True`:
    - The applicant is **Accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False`:
    - The applicant is **Rejected** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have an applicant with the following data:

```python
applicant = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}
```

Calling the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True]
```

This means the application is **Accepted**.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys exactly as specified:
  - `'Age'`
  - `'Income.per.dependent'`
  - `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`
  - `'Own.home'`
  - `'Self.employed'`
  - `'Derogatory.reports'`

- The function strictly uses the **"Derogatory.reports"** feature for decision-making, as it's the most significant feature in this simple decision tree with a maximum depth of 1.

- This implementation aligns with the example you provided and follows the required format.
