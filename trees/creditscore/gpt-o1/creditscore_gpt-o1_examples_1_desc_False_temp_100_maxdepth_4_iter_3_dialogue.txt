            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Own.home == 1 or Self.employed == 1
                nodes[3] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1 or X['Self.employed'] == 1)
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Application Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application Rejected due to high credit card expenses
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application Rejected due to low income per dependent
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application Rejected due to derogatory reports
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list keeps track of whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`).

- **Feature Conditions:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the applicant has **no derogatory reports**.
    ```python
    nodes[0] = int(X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 0)
    ```
  - **Node 1:** Checks if the **income per dependent** is **greater than 3.5**.
    ```python
    nodes[1] = int(X['Income.per.dependent'] > 3.5)
    ```
  - **Node 2:** Checks if the **monthly credit card expenses** are **$1,500 or less**.
    ```python
    nodes[2] = int(X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 1500)
    ```
  - **Node 3:** Checks if the applicant **owns a home** or is **self-employed**.
    ```python
    nodes[3] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1 or X['Self.employed'] == 1)
    ```

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If **Node 0** condition is not met (the applicant has derogatory reports), the application is **rejected**.
  - If **Node 0** is satisfied but **Node 1** is not (insufficient income per dependent), the application is **rejected**.
  - If **Node 0** and **Node 1** are satisfied but **Node 2** is not (high credit card expenses), the application is **rejected**.
  - If **Nodes 0, 1,** and **2** are satisfied but **Node 3** is not (does not own a home and is not self-employed), the application is **rejected**.
  - If all nodes **0** to **3** are satisfied, the application is **accepted**.

- **Feature Encoding and Ranges:**
  - **Derogatory.reports:** Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7) — must be `0` for acceptance.
  - **Income.per.dependent:** Income per dependent, ranging from **1.5 to 10** — must be greater than **3.5**.
  - **Monthly.credit.card.exp:** Monthly credit card expenses in dollars — must be **$1,500 or less**.
  - **Own.home:** Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
  - **Self.employed:** Self-employed status (1 = yes, 0 = no).

- **Return Value:**
  - `prediction`: `1` if the application is **accepted**, `0` if **rejected**.
  - `nodes`: A list `[node0, node1, node2, node3]` where each element is `1` if the condition is satisfied or `0` otherwise.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example applicant data
applicant = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1200,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes: [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- All conditions are satisfied (`nodes` list is `[1, 1, 1, 1]`), so the application is **accepted**.

**Another Example:**

```python
# Applicant with derogatory reports
applicant = {
    'Age': 45,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1000,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(applicant)

print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Rejected
Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- The first condition is not satisfied (`Derogatory.reports` > 0), so the application is **rejected** immediately.
- The remaining nodes are not evaluated, and their values remain `0`.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the feature keys in the input dictionary `X` match exactly with the specified keys:
  - `'Age'`
  - `'Income.per.dependent'`
  - `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`
  - `'Own.home'`
  - `'Self.employed'`
  - `'Derogatory.reports'`

- The function strictly adheres to the decision tree logic and encodings provided.
