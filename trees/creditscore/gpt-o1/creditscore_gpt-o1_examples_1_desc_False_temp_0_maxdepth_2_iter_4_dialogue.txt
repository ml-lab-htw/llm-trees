def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts credit application approval based on applicant features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing applicant features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of 
               truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] >= 3  # Using 3 as a reasonable threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Approved if low derogatory reports and good income
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Denied if low derogatory reports but low income
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Denied if high derogatory reports

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Access:** The code now accesses features using the correct keys from the provided feature list (e.g., `X['Derogatory.reports']`).
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've used a threshold of `1` for 'Derogatory.reports' (more than one report is a red flag) and `3` for 'Income.per.dependent' as a plausible division point on the 1.5-10 scale. These could be refined with real-world data.
* **Aligned with Target Encoding:** The function returns `1` for approval and `0` for denial, matching the provided target encoding.
* **Docstrings:**  Added a docstring to the function to explain its purpose, arguments, and return value.


**Example Usage:**

```python
applicant_data = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Approved)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


applicant_data2 = {
    'Age': 25,
    'Income.per.dependent': 2,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 600,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 3,
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(applicant_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Denied)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False]

```


This improved function now correctly implements the decision tree logic and returns the prediction and node truth values. Remember that the performance of this decision tree depends heavily on the chosen thresholds and the actual relationships within the data, which would be learned from a training dataset in a real-world application.
