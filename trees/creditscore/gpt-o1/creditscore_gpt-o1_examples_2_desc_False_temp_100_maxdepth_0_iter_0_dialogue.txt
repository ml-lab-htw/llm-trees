Based on the decision tree provided and the specified features and encodings, here's the Python function that predicts whether a credit application is **accepted** (1) or **not accepted** (0). The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for each inner node condition.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Evaluate the conditions for each node and store the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.5)
    nodes[2] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1)
    nodes[3] = int(X['Self.employed'] == 0)
    nodes[4] = int(X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 500)

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
        prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Self.employed == 0
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
                        prediction = 1  # Accepted
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Not Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes and Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the number of derogatory reports is greater than 0.
    - `nodes[0] = int(X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0)`
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5.
    - `nodes[1] = int(X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.5)`
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the applicant owns a home.
    - `nodes[2] = int(X['Own.home'] == 1)`
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the applicant is **not** self-employed.
    - `nodes[3] = int(X['Self.employed'] == 0)`
  - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the monthly credit card expenses are greater than \$500.
    - `nodes[4] = int(X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 500)`

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If the applicant has any derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is `1`), the application is **not accepted** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If there are no derogatory reports (`nodes[0]` is `0`):
    - If income per dependent is less than or equal to \$4.5k (`nodes[1]` is `1`), the application is **not accepted**.
    - If income per dependent is greater than \$4.5k (`nodes[1]` is `0`):
      - If the applicant owns a home (`nodes[2]` is `1`), the application is **accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
      - If the applicant does not own a home (`nodes[2]` is `0`):
        - If the applicant is not self-employed (`nodes[3]` is `1`), the application is **accepted**.
        - If the applicant is self-employed (`nodes[3]` is `0`):
          - If monthly credit card expenses are greater than \$500 (`nodes[4]` is `1`), the application is **accepted**.
          - If monthly credit card expenses are \$500 or less (`nodes[4]` is `0`), the application is **not accepted**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input dictionary with feature values
X_sample = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 600,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Accepted'}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Accepted
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

In this example:

- `Derogatory.reports` is `0`, so `nodes[0]` is `0`.
- `Income.per.dependent` is `6.0`, so `nodes[1]` is `0`.
- `Own.home` is `0`, so `nodes[2]` is `0`.
- `Self.employed` is `1`, so `nodes[3]` is `0`.
- `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is `600`, so `nodes[4]` is `1`.
- Since the applicant has no derogatory reports, sufficient income per dependent, is self-employed but has high credit card expenses, the application is **accepted**.

**Notes:**

- The feature names in the dictionary `X` must match exactly as specified in the feature list:
  - `'Age'`
  - `'Income.per.dependent'`
  - `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`
  - `'Own.home'` (1 = yes, 0 = no)
  - `'Self.employed'` (1 = yes, 0 = no)
  - `'Derogatory.reports'`
- The target variable encoding is `0` for **Not Accepted** and `1` for **Accepted**.
- The thresholds used in the conditions are meaningful values based on typical credit assessment criteria.
  - For example, an income per dependent threshold of \$4.5k distinguishes between lower and higher income levels.
  - A monthly credit card expense threshold of \$500 indicates significant credit usage.

**Adjustments to Thresholds:**

- If you have access to actual data or domain knowledge, you may adjust the thresholds to better reflect realistic criteria.
- The thresholds provided are placeholders intended to be meaningful but may be tailored to specific datasets or credit policies.

**Function Summary:**

- The `predict` function can be integrated into a larger application or used for batch processing of multiple credit applications.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were met during the decision-making process, which can be useful for auditing or explaining decisions.
