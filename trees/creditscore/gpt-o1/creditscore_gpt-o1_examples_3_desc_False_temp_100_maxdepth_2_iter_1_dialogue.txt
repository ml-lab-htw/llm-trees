Sure! Below is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Application Denied
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Application Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application Denied

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Names:** Used exactly as provided, paying close attention to their spelling and capitalization.
  - `"Age"`
  - `"Income.per.dependent"`
  - `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
  - `"Own.home"`
  - `"Self.employed"`
  - `"Derogatory.reports"`

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0` = Application for credit is **not accepted** (Denied)
  - `1` = Application for credit is **accepted**

- **Inner Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `Derogatory.reports > 0`
    - `1` if the applicant has any derogatory reports (condition is **True**)
    - `0` if the applicant has no derogatory reports (condition is **False**)
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `Income.per.dependent >= 5`
    - Evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `0` (no derogatory reports)
    - `1` if income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5 (condition is **True**)
    - `0` if income per dependent is less than 5 (condition is **False**)

**Decision Logic:**

1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`):**
   - If the applicant has any derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports > 0`), the application is **denied** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If not, proceed to the next node.

2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):**
   - If the applicant's income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5 (`Income.per.dependent >= 5`), the application is **accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
   - Otherwise, the application is **denied** (`prediction = 0`).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example applicant data
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Should output 1 (Accepted)
print("Inner Nodes:", nodes)      # Should output [0, 1]
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Inner Nodes: [0, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The applicant has **no** derogatory reports.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: The applicant's income per dependent is **greater than or equal to 5**.
  - **Prediction:** The application is **accepted**.

**Notes:**

- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The classification result (`0` or `1`).
  - `nodes`: A list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
- Boolean values are converted to integers (`True` to `1`, `False` to `0`) to match the requested format.
- The function can handle any input dictionary `X` containing the required feature keys.

**Additional Example:**

```python
# Another applicant data example
X = {
    "Age": 42,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
    "Own.home": 0,
    "Self.employed": 1,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Should output 0 (Denied)
print("Inner Nodes:", nodes)      # Should output [0, 0]
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0
Inner Nodes: [0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The applicant has **no** derogatory reports.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: The applicant's income per dependent is **less than 5**.
  - **Prediction:** The application is **denied**.

**Summary:**

- This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 based on the most important features affecting credit approval.
- It provides a clear and interpretable classification mechanism for credit applications.
- By returning the truth values of the inner nodes, we can trace the path taken in the decision tree for each prediction.
