**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (1 for `Derogatory.reports` and 4 for `Income.per.dependent`) are still somewhat arbitrary. Ideally, these should be determined using a training dataset and a suitable decision tree learning algorithm (like those in scikit-learn).
* **Feature Scaling:**  In real-world applications, it's usually a good idea to scale or normalize numeric features (like income and expenses) before using them in a decision tree.  This can prevent features with larger ranges from dominating the tree's structure.
* **Missing Values:**  The current function doesn't handle missing values.  You might want to add checks for missing data and implement appropriate strategies (e.g., imputation or using a default value).
* **More Complex Logic (Optional):**  If you had a deeper tree, you could incorporate additional features and more complex decision logic.  For instance, you could add a condition based on `Monthly.credit.card.exp` relative to `Income.per.dependent` to check for overspending.


This improved version provides a more functional and practical implementation based on your requirements. Remember that for optimal performance, you would train this model on real data and use appropriate machine learning libraries.
