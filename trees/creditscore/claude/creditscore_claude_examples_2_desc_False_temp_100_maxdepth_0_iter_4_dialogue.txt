Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature names and target encoding you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X['Age'] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 1000
    nodes[4] = X['Own.home'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if X['Derogatory.reports'] == 0:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 7.0:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the exact feature names you provided and follows the decision tree structure I outlined earlier. I've used meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions and ranges you provided.

Note that the 'Self.employed' feature is not used in this decision tree, as it was determined to be less predictive than the other features for this particular model.
