Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the results (True/False) in the `nodes` list.
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. Returns the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the `nodes` list.

The decision tree uses the following features and thresholds:
1. Income per dependent (threshold: 4.5)
2. Age (threshold: 35 years)
3. Number of derogatory reports (threshold: 1)

These thresholds are based on reasonable assumptions for credit decisions, but they can be adjusted based on specific business rules or data analysis.
