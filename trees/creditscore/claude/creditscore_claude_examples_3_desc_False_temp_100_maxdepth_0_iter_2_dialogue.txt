Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and target encoding you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[4] = X["Own.home"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else node for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted), and the second element is a list of the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features:
1. Income.per.dependent
2. Age
3. Derogatory.reports
4. Own.home
5. Monthly.credit.card.exp

The thresholds and conditions are set based on the earlier decision tree, with some adjustments to match the feature descriptions you provided:

- Income.per.dependent threshold is set to 3.5 (middle of the 1.5 to 10 range)
- Age threshold is set to 25 years
- Derogatory.reports thresholds are set to 0 and 1
-
