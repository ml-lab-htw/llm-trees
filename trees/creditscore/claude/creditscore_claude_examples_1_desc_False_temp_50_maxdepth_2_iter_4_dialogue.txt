I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature names provided and the specified target encoding (0 = no, 1 = yes).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: check if Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    
    # Second node: check if Derogatory.reports > 0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if Income.per.dependent is <= 3.5
4. For lower income applicants, checks if there are any derogatory reports
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds used are:
- Income.per.dependent: 3.5 (middle of the 1.5-10 range)
- Derogatory.reports: 0 (any derogatory reports are considered negative)
