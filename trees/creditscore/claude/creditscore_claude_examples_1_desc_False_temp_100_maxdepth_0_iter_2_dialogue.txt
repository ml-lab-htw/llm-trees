Based on the provided feature names and their descriptions, I'll create a decision tree function that implements the previously discussed logic with specific thresholds and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 25

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # No derogatory reports
        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent > 4.0
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Income per dependent <= 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1
            else:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0
    else:  # Has derogatory reports
        if X["Income.per.dependent"] > 7.0 and X["Own.home"] == 1:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the node conditions
- Uses reasonable thresholds:
  - Income.per.dependent thresholds at 4.0 and 7.0 (within the 1.5 to 10 range)
  - Age threshold at 25 years
  - Derogatory.reports threshold at 0
  - Own.home uses the binary encoding (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Follows common credit decision logic
- Stores three main node conditions in the nodes list

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 or 1)
2. A list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
