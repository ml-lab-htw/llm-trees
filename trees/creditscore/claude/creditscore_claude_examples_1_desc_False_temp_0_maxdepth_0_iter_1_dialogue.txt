I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree we discussed, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 25
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age > 25
                if X["Own.home"] == 1:
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            else:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the three main decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions in the decision tree
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of boolean values for the inner nodes

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory.reports: 1 (common threshold for credit decisions)
- Income.per.dependent: 4.0 (reasonable threshold within the given range of 1.5 to 10)
- Age: 25 (common threshold for young vs established credit applicants)

The decision tree prioritizes:
1. Derogatory reports as the primary split
2. Income per dependent as the secondary split
3. Age and home ownership for borderline cases

The function can be used like this:
```python
# Example usage
applicant = {
    "Age":
