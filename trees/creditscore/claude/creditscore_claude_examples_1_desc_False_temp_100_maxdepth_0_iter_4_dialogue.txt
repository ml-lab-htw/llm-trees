def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Check nodes in order of importance
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0  
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 25
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 800

    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1
            else:  # Age <= 25
                if nodes[3]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 800
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:
                prediction = 1
            else:

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the feature names as keys
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes for the main decision points
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result
4. Uses nested if-else statements to determine the prediction
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted) and the list of node results

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory reports: 1 (standard cutoff)
- Income per dependent: 4.0 (middle of 1.5-10 range)
- Age: 25 years (common minimum for credit)
- Monthly credit card expenses: $800 (reasonable limit)
