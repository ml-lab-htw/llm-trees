Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. It evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Checks if Income per dependent is <= 5.5
   - Node 1: Checks if Age is <= 35
   - Node 2: Checks if the number of Derogatory reports is <= 1
4. Based on these conditions, it determines the prediction:
   - If Income per dependent <= 5.5 and Age <= 35, the application is rejected (0)
   - If Income per dependent <= 5.5 and Age > 35, the application is accepted (1)
   - If Income per dependent > 5.5 and Derogatory reports <= 1, the application is accepted (1)
   - If Income per dependent > 5.5 and Derogatory reports > 1, the application is rejected (0)
5. The function returns the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, uses the correct feature names as given, and follows the target encoding (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) as specified in your instructions.
