Based on the provided feature names and the decision tree I proposed earlier, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one internal node for depth=1 tree
    
    # Decision node based on Income.per.dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    
    # Make prediction based on the decision
    if nodes[0]:  # If Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
        prediction = 0  # Reject application
    else:  # If Income.per.dependent > 4.5
        prediction = 1  # Accept application
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Evaluates if Income.per.dependent is <= 4.5 (chosen as a reasonable threshold given the range 1.5 to 10)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision condition

I kept the threshold at 4.5 as it represents a middle-range value for Income.per.dependent that could reasonably separate credit-worthy from non-credit-worthy applications.
