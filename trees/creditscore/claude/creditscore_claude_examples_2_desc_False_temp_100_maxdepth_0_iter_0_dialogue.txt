Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and examples. Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the exact feature names you provided and follows the structure of the decision tree I created earlier. I've adjusted some of the thresholds to be more specific based on the feature descriptions you provided:

1. Income per dependent threshold is set to 3.5 (middle of the 1.5 to 10 range)
2. Age threshold is set to 25 years
3. Derogatory reports threshold is set to 1
4. Monthly credit card expenses threshold is set to $1000

The function checks these conditions in order and classifies the application as accepted (1) or rejected (0) based on
