Thank you for the detailed instructions. I'll format the decision tree as a Python function based on the provided examples and the features you've specified. Here's the function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the results in `nodes`.
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and determine the prediction.
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used in this function are:
- Income per dependent: 5.5
- Age: 35 years
- Number of derogatory reports: 1

These thresholds are based on reasonable assumptions for credit decisions, but they can be adjusted based on specific business rules or data analysis.
