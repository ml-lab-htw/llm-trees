Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific requirements you've provided, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X['Age'] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 2000
    nodes[4] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    nodes[5] = X['Self.employed'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if X['Age'] <= 30:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                if X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 7.0:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names exactly as you provided. It returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following thresholds:
- Income per dependent: 3.5 and 7.0
- Age: 25 and 30
- Monthly credit card expenses: $2000
- Derogatory reports: 1

The function checks these conditions in the order specified by the decision tree, and returns the appropriate prediction based on the path through the tree.

Note that this implementation
