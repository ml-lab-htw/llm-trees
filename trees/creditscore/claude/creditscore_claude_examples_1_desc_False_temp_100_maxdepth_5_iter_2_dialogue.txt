Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, here's the prediction function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Main splits with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 5000
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:  # Own.home = yes
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Own.home = no
                if nodes[4]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 5000
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 5000
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with the specified feature names
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
  - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each internal node
- Uses realistic thresholds for the features
- Follows the same logic as the decision tree presented earlier
- Uses the exact feature names and encodings
