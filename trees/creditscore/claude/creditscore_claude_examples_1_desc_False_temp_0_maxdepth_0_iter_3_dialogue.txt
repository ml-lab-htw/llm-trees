I'll create a Python function for the credit application decision tree based on the specified features and their encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 25
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:  # Age <= 25
                if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 800:
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes for the main decision points
3. Evaluates the conditions in a hierarchical manner
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of boolean values for the main nodes

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory reports: 1 (common threshold for credit decisions)
- Income per dependent: 4.0 (middle range of the 1.5-10 scale)
- Age: 25 years (common threshold for credit maturity)
- Monthly credit card expenses: $800 (reasonable threshold for spending evaluation)

The decision tree prioritizes derogatory reports as the first split, followed by income per dependent and age, which are common factors in credit
