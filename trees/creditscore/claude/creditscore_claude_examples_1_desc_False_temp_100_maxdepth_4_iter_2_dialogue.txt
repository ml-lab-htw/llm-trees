Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and value ranges, I'll create a decision tree function that matches your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check income per dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second level: Check derogatory reports
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    
    # Third level: Check for higher income cases
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    nodes[4] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if nodes[4]:  # Own.home = 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Own.home = 0
                if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 3000:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes to store boolean values for the decision points
3. Uses realistic threshold values based on the feature descriptions
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the exact feature names as provide
