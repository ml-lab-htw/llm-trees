Based on the provided feature details, I'll create a decision tree function using 'Income.per.dependent' as the main decision feature with a reasonable threshold of 4.5:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If income per dependent <= 4.5
        prediction = 0  # Reject application
    else:  # If income per dependent > 4.5
        prediction = 1  # Accept application

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
- Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the condition
- Uses a threshold of 4.5 for Income.per.dependent, which is reasonable given the specified range of 1.5 to 10
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - The prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
  - The list of node conditions (will contain one boolean value)

Note that while other features are available, this simple decision tree only uses Income.per.dependent as the decision feature, as per the requirement of maximum depth=1 and using the most important feature for credit decisions.
