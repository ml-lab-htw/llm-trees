I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature names and encoding you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates whether:
   - First node: Derogatory reports are <= 1
   - Second node: Income per dependent is <= 3.5
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 (accepted) or 0 (rejected)
   - nodes: list of boolean values (True/False) for each decision node

The thresholds (1 for Derogatory.reports and 3.5 for Income.per.dependent) are chosen based on domain knowledge:
- More than 1 derogatory report is typically considered a significant red flag
- Income per dependent of 3.5 represents a moderate income level within the given range of 1.5 to 10
