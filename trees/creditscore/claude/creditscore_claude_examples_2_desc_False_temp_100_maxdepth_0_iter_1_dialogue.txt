Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific requirements you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[4] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[5] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 7.0:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else node for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
2. A list of 6 elements representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 if not, or None if not evaluated)

The function uses the exact keys you provided for the features and follows the encoding you specified for the target variable (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted). It also uses meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions and ranges you provided.

Note that the "Self.employed" feature is not used in this decision tree, as it was deemed less important for the classification in the
