Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for credit application acceptance. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree as described earlier, with the following considerations:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. The `nodes` list stores the boolean values for each condition in the decision tree.
3. The prediction is binary: 0 for rejected (no) and 1 for accepted (yes), as specified in the target variable description.
4. The thresholds and conditions are set based on the earlier description and the provided feature information.
5. The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node conditions (True/False values).

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree described earlier, using the exact feature names provided and the correct target variable encoding. It considers all the important features mentioned in the original tree: Income per dependent, Age, Number of derogatory reports, Owning a home, Monthly credit card expenses, and Self-employed status.
