Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check income per dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second level: Check derogatory reports
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    
    # Third level: Check age for lower income branch
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    
    # Fourth level: Check derogatory reports for higher income branch
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2
    
    # Fifth level: Check home ownership and higher income threshold
    nodes[4] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 2
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 2
            if nodes[4]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                prediction = 1 if X["Income.per.dependent"] > 6.0 else 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes corresponding to the decision points
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result in the nodes list
4. Uses these conditions to determine whether to accept (1) or reject (0) the application
5. Returns
