Based on the provided feature details and the previous decision tree with income per dependent as the key feature, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If income per dependent <= 4.5
        prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:  # If income per dependent > 4.5
        prediction = 1  # Accept

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the feature names as keys
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the single split condition
3. Checks if Income.per.dependent is <= 4.5 (reasonable threshold given the range 1.5 to 10)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the split condition

The threshold 4.5 is chosen because:
- The feature range is 1.5 to 10
- 4.5 represents a moderate income per dependent that could reasonably separate credit-worthy from non-credit-worthy applications
