Based on the provided feature names and specifications, here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Main decision nodes with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0 if X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 6.0 else 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses exactly the feature names provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions
- Uses realistic thresholds:
  - Income per dependent threshold at 3.0 and 6.0
  - Monthly credit card expenses threshold at $500
  - Derogatory reports thresholds at 0 and 1
  - Home ownership as binary (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Follows the same structure as the decision tree provided earlier
- Has a maximum depth of 4
