I'll create a Python function based on the decision tree we discussed, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the 5 conditions in our tree
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 25
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # accepted
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                if nodes[3]:  # Age > 25
                    prediction = 1  # accepted
                else:  # Age <= 25
                    prediction = 0  # rejected
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if nodes[4]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
                prediction = 1  # accepted
            else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
                prediction = 0  # rejected
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes representing the decision conditions
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result
4. Uses nested if-else statements to traverse the tree
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory reports: 1 (common threshold for credit decisions)
- Income per dependent: 4.0 (reasonable threshold within the 1.5-
