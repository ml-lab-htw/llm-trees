Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific requirements you've provided, I'll create a Python function that predicts whether a credit application is accepted or not, along with the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names you provided. It returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
2. A list of the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 if not, None if the node wasn't evaluated)

The thresholds and conditions in the decision tree are based on reasonable assumptions:
- Income per dependent threshold is set to 3.5 (on a scale of 1.5 to 10)
- Age threshold is set to 25 years
- Derogatory reports threshold is set to 1
- Monthly credit card expenses threshold is set to $1000

The function evaluates the conditions in the order
