Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
2. It evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Checks if income per dependent is <= 4.5
   - Node 1: Checks if age is <= 35
   - Node 2: Checks if the number of derogatory reports is <= 1
3. It then uses these conditions to determine the prediction:
   - If income per dependent is low (<=4.5) and age is young (<=35), the application is rejected (0).
   - If income per dependent is low but age is older (>35), the application is accepted (1).
   - If income per dependent is higher (>4.5) and there is at most one derogatory report, the application is accepted (1).
   - If income per dependent is higher but there are more than one derogatory reports, the application is rejected (0).
4. The function returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, using the exact feature names given and the specified target encoding (0 for rejection, 1 for acceptance).
