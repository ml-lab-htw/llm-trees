Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the 4 conditions in our tree
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 25
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age > 25
                if nodes[3]:  # Own.home = yes
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:  # Own.home = no
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            else:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names you provided
2. Returns predictions as binary values (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted)
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the tree
4. Uses meaningful thresholds:
   - Derogatory reports threshold of 1 (more than 1 is high risk)
   - Income per dependent threshold of 4.0 (middle of the 1.5-10 range)
   - Age threshold of 25 years (young adult threshold)
   - Home ownership as binary (1 = yes, 0 = no)

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions (True/False values).
