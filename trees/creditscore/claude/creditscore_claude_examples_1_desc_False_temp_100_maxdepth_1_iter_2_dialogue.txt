Based on the credit application features and target encoding, here's the decision tree function that uses 'Income.per.dependent' as the main splitting criterion:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Since we only have depth 1, we only need one node
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If income per dependent is <= 4.5
        prediction = 0  # Reject application
    else:  # If income per dependent is > 4.5
        prediction = 1  # Accept application

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Evaluates whether Income.per.dependent is <= 4.5 (chosen as a reasonable threshold in the middle of the 1.5 to 10 range)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision condition

The threshold 4.5 represents a reasonable decision boundary where:
- Income per dependent â‰¤ 4.5 suggests higher financial risk (rejected)
- Income per dependent > 4.5 suggests lower financial risk (accepted)
