Based on the provided feature names, encoding, and value ranges, here's the prediction function for the credit acceptance decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 0  # 0 means no
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if nodes[2]:  # Own.home = no (0)
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Own.home = yes (1)
            prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three decision nodes
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result (True=1, False=0)
4. Returns both the prediction (0=rejected, 1=accepted) and the list of node results

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on reasonable values:
- Income.per.dependent threshold of 3.5 (in the middle of the possible range 1.5-10)
- Any derogatory reports (>0) as a negative indicator
- Home ownership as a binary condition (0=no, 1=yes)
