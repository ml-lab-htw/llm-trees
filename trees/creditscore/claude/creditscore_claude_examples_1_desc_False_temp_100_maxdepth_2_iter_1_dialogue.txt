Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and value ranges, I'll create a decision function for the credit acceptance decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low income per dependent
        if nodes[1]:  # Has derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # No derogatory reports
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # High income per dependent
        prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates whether Income.per.dependent is <= 3.5 (node 0)
4. Evaluates whether Derogatory.reports > 0 (node 1)
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for rejected, 1 for accepted
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each decision node

The thresholds (3.5 for Income.per.dependent and 0 for Derogatory.reports) are chosen based on the provided ranges and typical credit decision logic.
