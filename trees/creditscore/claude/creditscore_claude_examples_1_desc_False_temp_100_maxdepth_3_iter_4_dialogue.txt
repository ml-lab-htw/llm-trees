Based on the provided feature names and encodings, here's the decision tree function that incorporates my previous tree structure with proper variable names and sensible thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on income per dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    
    # Second split on derogatory reports
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    
    # Third split on home ownership
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low income per dependent
        if nodes[1]:  # Has derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # No derogatory reports
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Higher income per dependent
        if nodes[2]:  # Owns home
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # Doesn't own home
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the feature names as keys
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes representing the conditions in the tree
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions
4. Uses the exact feature names provided
5. Uses sensible thresholds (3.0 for income per dependent, which is in the middle of the possible range 1.5-10)
6. Uses the correct encoding for Own.home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
7. Properly handles derogatory reports (checking if > 0)
