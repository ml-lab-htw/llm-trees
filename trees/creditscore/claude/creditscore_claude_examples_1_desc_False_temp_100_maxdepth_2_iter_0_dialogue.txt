Based on the provided feature specifications and the desired format, here's the decision tree prediction function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # income per dependent <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # has derogatory reports
            prediction = 0  # rejected
        else:  # no derogatory reports
            prediction = 1  # accepted
    else:  # income per dependent > 4.0
        prediction = 1  # accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes corresponding to the two decision points in our tree
3. First checks if Income.per.dependent is <= 4.0 (a reasonable threshold considering the range 1.5 to 10)
4. For lower income cases, checks if there are any derogatory reports
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions
6. The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds chosen (4.0 for Income.per.dependent and 0 for Derogatory.reports) are reasonable given the provided feature ranges and typical credit decision criteria.
