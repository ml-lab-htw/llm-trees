Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and ranges, here's the Python function implementing the previously discussed decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 0  # 0 = no

    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if nodes[2]:  # Not owning a home
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # Owning a home
            prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with the feature names as keys
- Uses three decision nodes based on Income.per.dependent, Derogatory.reports, and Own.home
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted)
  - list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- Uses realistic thresholds:
  - Income.per.dependent threshold of 3.5 (within the 1.5 to 10 range)
  - Any derogatory reports (> 0) as a negative indicator
  - Home ownership as a binary feature (0 = no, 1 = yes)
