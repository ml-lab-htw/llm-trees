Based on the feature descriptions and the decision tree I proposed earlier, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:         # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with feature names as keys
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the condition
3. Evaluates if Income.per.dependent is <= 3.0 (threshold chosen as a reasonable value within the given range 1.5 to 10)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition

I kept the threshold at 3.0 as it represents a reasonable decision boundary: applicants with income per dependent above 3.0 are more likely to have sufficient resources to manage credit responsibly.
