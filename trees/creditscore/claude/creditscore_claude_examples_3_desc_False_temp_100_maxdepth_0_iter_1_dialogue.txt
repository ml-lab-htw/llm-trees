Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I proposed earlier, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X['Age'] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 1000
    nodes[4] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    nodes[5] = X['Age'] <= 30
    nodes[6] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input. It returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features:
1. Income.per.dependent
2. Age
3. Derogatory.reports
4. Monthly.credit.card.exp
5. Own.home

Note that the 'Self.employed' feature is not used in this decision tree, as it was deemed less important for the classification task based on the earlier analysis.

The thresholds used in the decision tree are:
- Income per dependent: 3.5
- Age: 25 and 30 years
- Derog
