Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing conditions
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2
    nodes[4] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[5] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 2000

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 2
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 2
            if nodes[4]:  # Own.home = 1
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:  # Own.home = 0
                if nodes[5]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 2000
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
                else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 2000
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 6 nodes to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result in the nodes list
4. Uses nested if
