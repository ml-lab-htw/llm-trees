Thank you for providing the detailed information and examples. Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and target encoding you've provided, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using the most important features as determined in our earlier discussion. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values for a single applicant.
2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the boolean results of each condition in the tree.
3. The first condition checks if the income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5.
4. If income per dependent is <= 4.5, it then checks if the age is <= 35.
5. If income per dependent is > 4.5, it checks if the number of derogatory reports is <= 1.
6. Based on these conditions, it determines whether the application is accepted (1) or rejected (0).
7. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, using the correct feature names and target encoding as specified in your instructions.
