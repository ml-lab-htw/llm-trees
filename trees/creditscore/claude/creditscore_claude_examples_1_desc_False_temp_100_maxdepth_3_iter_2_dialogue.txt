Based on the provided feature names and specifications, I'll create a prediction function for the credit application decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.5
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Accept
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # Reject
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions using the exact feature names provided
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses reasonable thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions
6. Follows the same tree structure as previously discussed, but with proper feature names and encodings

The thresholds and conditions are set based on common sense for credit decisions:
- Derogatory reports > 1 is a clear rejection signal
- Income per dependent > 4.5 is a good indicator for acceptance
- Home ownership (1 = yes) is a positive factor for those with lower income
