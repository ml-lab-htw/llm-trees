Based on the provided features and their specifications, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure we discussed and uses the exact feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to track conditions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 25
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                if nodes[3]:  # Age > 25
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if X["Derogatory.reports"] == 0 and X["Age"] > 30:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the exact feature names as input
2. Uses realistic threshold values based on the feature descriptions
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
4. Follows common credit decision logic where:
   - Multiple derogatory reports lead to rejection
   - Higher income and home ownership are positive factors
   - Age is used as a secondary factor
5. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided

The thresholds chosen are based on reasonable assumptions for credit decisions:
- Derogatory reports > 1 is an automatic rejection
- Income per dependent > 4.0 is considered good
- Age thresholds at 25 and 30
