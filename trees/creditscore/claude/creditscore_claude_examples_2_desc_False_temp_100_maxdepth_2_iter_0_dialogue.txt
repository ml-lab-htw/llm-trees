Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific requirements you've provided, I'll create a Python function that predicts whether a credit application is accepted or not, and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. I'll use meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions you provided.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as there are 3 decision nodes in our tree of depth 2).

2. It populates the `nodes` list with boolean values based on the conditions at each decision node:
   - The first node checks if Income.per.dependent is <= 5.5
   - The second node checks if Age is <= 35
   - The third node checks if Derogatory.reports is <= 1

3. It then uses these boolean values to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction:
   - If Income.per.dependent <= 5.5 and Age <= 35, the application is rejected (0)
   - If Income.per.dependent <= 5.5 and Age > 35, the application is accepted (1)
   - If Income.per.dependent > 5.5 and Derogatory.reports <= 1, the application is accepted (1)
   - If Income.per.dependent > 5.5 and Derogatory.reports > 1, the application is rejected (0)

4. Finally, it returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node truth values.
