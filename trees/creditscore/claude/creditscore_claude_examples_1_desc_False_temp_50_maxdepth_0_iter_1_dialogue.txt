I'll create a decision tree function based on the tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing conditions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 25
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.0
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                if nodes[3]:  # Age > 25
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:  # Age <= 25
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.0
            if X["Derogatory.reports"] == 0:
                if X["Age"] > 30:
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            else:  # Derogatory.reports == 1
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of each condition
3. Evaluates the key decision points in the tree
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory reports: 1 (critical threshold)
- Income per dependent: 4.0 (reasonable income level)
- Age: 25 and 30 (different age th
