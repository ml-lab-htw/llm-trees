Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. I'll use meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions provided.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. We create a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree).
3. The first node checks if the income per dependent is <= 4.5.
4. The second node checks if the age is <= 30 (for those with lower income per dependent).
5. The third node checks if the number of derogatory reports is <= 1 (for those with higher income per dependent).
6. The prediction is made based on these conditions, with 0 representing a rejected application and 1 representing an accepted application.
7. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the provided feature keys and target variable encoding. It uses the most important features from our decision tree (Income per dependent, Age, and Derogatory reports) to make the prediction.
