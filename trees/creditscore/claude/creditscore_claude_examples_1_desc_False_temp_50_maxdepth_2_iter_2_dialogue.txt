I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature names provided and the specified target encoding (0 = no, 1 = yes):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 0
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node: checks if Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
   - Second node: checks if Derogatory.reports > 0
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition

The thresholds used are:
- Income.per.dependent: 3.5 (reasonable threshold between low and medium income)
- Derogatory.reports: 0 (any derogatory reports are considered negative)
