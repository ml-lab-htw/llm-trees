I'll create a decision tree function based on the tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names you provided and the specified encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node: whether Derogatory.reports is ≤ 1
   - Second node: whether Income.per.dependent is ≤ 3.5
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (rejected) or 1 (accepted)
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition

The thresholds chosen are:
- Derogatory.reports: 1 (reasonable threshold as even one derogatory report is significant)
- Income.per.dependent: 3.5 (middle range value between 1.5 and 10)

These thresholds aim to be conservative in credit approval, requiring both good credit history (few derogatory reports) and sufficient income per dependent.
