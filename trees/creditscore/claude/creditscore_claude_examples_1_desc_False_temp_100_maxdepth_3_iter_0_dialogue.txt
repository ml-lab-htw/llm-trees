Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and expected output format, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Navigate through the tree
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if nodes[2]:  # Own.home = 1 (yes)
            prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
        else:  # Own.home = 0 (no)
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions
3. Uses realistic thresholds (3.5 for income per dependent)
4. Uses the correct encoding for Own.home (1 for yes, 0 for no)
5. Properly handles the derogatory reports as a numeric value
6. Maintains the same tree structure as previously discussed

The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0) for the given input.
