Based on the provided feature specifications and encoding, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node decisions
    
    # Decision nodes with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports == 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1:  # Using direct comparison here as it's a different threshold
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of 4 inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result (True=1, False=0) in the nodes list
4. Returns both the final prediction (0=rejected, 1=accepted) and the list of node decisions

The thresholds were chosen based on reasonable values:
- Income.per.dependent threshold of 3.5 (within the given range of 1.5 to 10)
- Age threshold of 25 years (typical risk threshold for young applicants)
- Derogatory.reports thresholds of 0 and 1 (within given range of 0-7)
- Own.home as binary (1=yes, 0=no
