Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, here's the decision tree function that implements the previous tree structure with appropriate thresholds and returns both the prediction and node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0
    nodes[2] = X['Age'] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 1
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary with the feature names as keys
- Uses sensible thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
  - list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- Uses only the provided feature names with exact spelling
- Implements the same tree structure as previously shown, but with proper variable names and encodings

The thresholds were chosen based on the provided feature descriptions:
- Income.per.dependent threshold of 3.0 (within the 1.5 to 10 range)
- Age threshold of 25 years (reasonable for credit decisions)
- Derogatory.reports thresholds of 0 and 1 (within the
