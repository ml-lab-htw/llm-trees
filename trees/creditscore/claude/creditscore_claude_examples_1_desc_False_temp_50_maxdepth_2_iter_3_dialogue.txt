I'll create a Python function for the credit application decision tree based on the provided feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    # Second decision node: income per dependent
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent > 3.5
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:  # Income per dependent <= 3.5
            prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:  # Derogatory reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # Reject

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted)
3. Uses meaningful thresholds:
   - Derogatory reports threshold of 1 (given that the range is 0-7)
   - Income per dependent threshold of 3.5 (given that the range is 1.5-10)
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
5. Maintains a maximum depth of 2

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns:
- A prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
- A list of two boolean values representing whether each condition was met

The decision logic follows the tree structure I provided earlier, using the most important features for credit decisions: derogatory reports and income per dependent.
