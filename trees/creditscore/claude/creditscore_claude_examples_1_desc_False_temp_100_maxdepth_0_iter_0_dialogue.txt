Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function according to your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.5
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                if X["Age"] > 25:
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
            if X["Derogatory.reports"] == 0:
                if nodes[3]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 1000
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            else:
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of 4 key decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions at each node
4. Returns both the final prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory reports: 1 (critical threshold)
- Income per dependent: 4.5 (middle of the 1.5-10 range)
- Monthly credit card expenses: $1000 (reasonable threshold for credit risk)
- Age
