Understood. I'll format the decision tree as a Python function based on the provided examples and using the exact feature keys you've specified. Here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.0
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 35
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the results (True = 1, False = 0) in the `nodes` list.
4. Uses the decision tree structure to determine the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted).
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used are:
- Income per dependent: 5.0 (middle of the given range 1.5 to 10)
- Age: 35 years (a common threshold for distinguishing younger from older applicants)
- Derogatory reports: 1 (assuming more than one report significantly increases risk)

This function adheres to the specified format and uses the exact feature keys provided. It returns a single prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes, matching the requested output format.
