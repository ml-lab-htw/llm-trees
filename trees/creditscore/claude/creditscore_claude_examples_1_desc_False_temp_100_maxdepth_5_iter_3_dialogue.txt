Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree and returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize list for 5 internal nodes
    
    # Internal node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 5000
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:  # Owns home
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Doesn't own home
                if nodes[4]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 5000
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 5000
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the specified feature names as keys
2. Uses realistic thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted) and a list of boolean values for the internal
