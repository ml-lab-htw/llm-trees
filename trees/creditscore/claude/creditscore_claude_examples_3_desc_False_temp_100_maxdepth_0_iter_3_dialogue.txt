Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific requirements you've outlined, I'll create a Python function that predicts whether a credit application is accepted (1) or rejected (0), along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions you provided.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names you provided.
2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. It evaluates each condition and stores the result (True or False) in the `nodes` list.
4. It then uses these conditions to navigate through the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. The prediction is 1 for "Accepted" and 0 for "Rejected", as per your specification.
6. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values, with each boolean converted to 1 (True)
