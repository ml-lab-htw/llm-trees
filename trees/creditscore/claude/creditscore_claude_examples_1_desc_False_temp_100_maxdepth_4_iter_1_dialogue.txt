Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store condition results
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Implement the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # REJECTED
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1:
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if nodes[3]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the feature names as keys
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes to store the condition results
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result
4. Implements the decision tree logic to determine acceptance (1) or rejection (0)
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Income per dependent: 3.0 (reasonable threshold for financial stability)
- Age: 25 years (common threshold for credit maturity)
- Derogatory reports: 0 and 1 as critical th
