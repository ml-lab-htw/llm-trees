I'll create a decision tree function based on the previously discussed tree structure, using the exact feature names and encoding you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 0
            prediction = 1  # Accept
        else:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Reject
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        prediction = 1  # Accept

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if Income.per.dependent is <= 3.5
4. For lower income applicants, checks if there are any derogatory reports
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted) and the list of node results

The thresholds are set to meaningful values:
- Income.per.dependent threshold of 3.5 (on a scale of 1.5 to 10) represents a moderate income level
- Derogatory.reports threshold of 0 means any derogatory reports will lead to rejection for lower-income applicants

The tree structure prioritizes the most important features for credit decisions while maintaining the required depth of 2.
