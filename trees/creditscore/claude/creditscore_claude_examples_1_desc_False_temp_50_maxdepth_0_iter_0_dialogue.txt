Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts credit application acceptance (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted) and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 25

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.5
            prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
        else:  # Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                if nodes[3]:  # Age > 25
                    prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
                else:  # Age <= 25
                    prediction = 0  # REJECTED
    else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
        if X["Income.per.dependent"] > 7.0:
            prediction = 1  # ACCEPTED
        else:
            prediction = 0  # REJECTED

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of 4 key decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions in a hierarchical manner
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Derogatory reports: 1 (common threshold for credit decisions)
- Income per dependent: 4.5 and 7.0 (reasonable thresholds within the 1.5-10 range)
- Age: 25 years (common threshold for young adult credit
