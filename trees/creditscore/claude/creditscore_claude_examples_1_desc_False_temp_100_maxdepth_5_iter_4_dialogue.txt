Based on the provided feature keys, target encoding, and value ranges, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store binary decisions
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 0
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 2000
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Age > 25
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Own.home == 0
                if nodes[4]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 2000
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 2000
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Uses the exact feature keys provided
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted)
  - list of boolean values for each decision node
- Uses realistic thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions
- Maintains a maximum depth
