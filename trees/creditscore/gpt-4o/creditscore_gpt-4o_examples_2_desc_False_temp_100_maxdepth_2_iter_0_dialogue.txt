Below is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns both the classification prediction and a list representing the truth values of the decision nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.00
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2  # This node is only evaluated if nodes[0] is False

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["Own.home"] == 1:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation
    
Here is a brief explanation and how the function works:

1. **Nodes Initialization**: We initialize a list of nodes where each element will hold a boolean value indicating whether a condition in the tree is satisfied.
2. **First Node Condition**: `nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.00`
    - This checks if the income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.00.
3. **Second Node Condition**: `nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2`
    - This node is checked only when `nodes[0]` is False, meaning that `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 4.00.
4. **Tree Decision**:
    - If `nodes[0]` is True (i.e., `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 4.00):
        - Further check the `Own.home` feature.
        - If `Own.home` is `1` (owns a home), the prediction is `1` (accepted).
        - Else, if `Own.home` is `0` (does not own a home), the prediction is `0` (rejected).
    - If `nodes[0]` is False (i.e., `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 4.00):
        - Check the `Derogatory.reports` feature.
        - If `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 2, the prediction is `1` (accepted).
        - Else, if `Derogatory.reports` is greater than 2, the prediction is `0` (rejected).

### Usage Example

Let's test the function with an example:

```python
X_test = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node values: {nodes}")
```

- **Input**: example with income per dependent = 5.0, owning a home = 1, and derogatory reports = 1.
- **Output**:
  - `Prediction: 1` (application for credit is accepted).
  - `Node values: [False, True]` (income condition not met, derogatory reports condition met).

This structured approach ensures clear decision-making based on the most influential features for credit approval.
