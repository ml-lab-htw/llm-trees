Based on your request, I will create a decision tree function in Python that takes a dictionary of feature values, evaluates the decision nodes, and returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. This will classify whether an application for credit is accepted (1) or not (0).

Here is the defined function:

```python
def predict_credit_application(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 8  # There are 8 inner nodes in the decision tree.

    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.50
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] <= 40
    nodes[4] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 300
    nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1
    nodes[6] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 300
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Income per dependent > 4.50
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of derogatory reports <= 1
            if nodes[2]:  # Owns a home
                prediction = 1  # accepted
            else:  # Does not own a home
                if nodes[3]:  # Age <= 40
                    prediction = 1  # accepted
                else:  # Age > 40
                    prediction = 0  # rejected
        else:  # Number of derogatory reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # rejected
    else:  # Income per dependent <= 4.50
        if nodes[4]:  # Monthly credit card expenses <= 300
            prediction = 0  # rejected
        else:  # Monthly credit card expenses > 300
            if nodes[5]:  # Self-employed
                prediction = 0  # rejected
            else:  # Not self-employed
                prediction = 1  # accepted

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    'Age': 35, 
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0, 
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 150, 
    'Own.home': 1, 
    'Self.employed': 0, 
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict_credit_application(example_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes Array:** An array `nodes` is created to store the truth values of each decision node in the tree.
2. **Node Conditions:** Each node evaluates a condition and stores the result (True/False) in the `nodes` array.
3. **Decision Logic:** The nested `if-else` statements implement the logic of the decision tree based on which nodes evaluate to True or False.
4. **Prediction and Nodes Output:** The function returns the final prediction (1 for accepted, 0 for rejected) and the array of node truth values.

### Sample Input:
For an input dictionary:
```json
{
    'Age': 35, 
    'Income.per.dependent': 5.0, 
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 150, 
    'Own.home': 1, 
    'Self.employed': 0, 
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}
```

### Sample Output:
The function should output:
```python
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [True, True, True, True, True, False, False, None]
```

This design allows for clear tracking of the decision path and can serve as a basis for more advanced model implementations.
