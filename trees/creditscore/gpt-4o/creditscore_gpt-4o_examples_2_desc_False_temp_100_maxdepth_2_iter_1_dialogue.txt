Given your specifications, let's create a `predict` function that takes a dictionary of feature values as input and returns a classification along with a list of truth values representing the decisions at each node in the decision tree.

Here is the `predict` function based on the described decision tree for credit application acceptance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.5 if nodes[0] else None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Importances**:
  - `Derogatory.reports` and `Income.per.dependent` are chosen as the important decision features.
  
- **Predict Function**:
  - The function initializes a list `nodes` of size 2 to store the evaluations of the decision tree conditions.
  - `nodes[0]` stores the result of the condition `Derogatory.reports <= 2`.
  - `nodes[1]` stores the result of the condition `Income.per.dependent > 3.5` if `nodes[0]` is `True`.
  
- **Classification**:
  - The decision depends on whether the conditions at each node are satisfied.
  - If `Derogatory.reports <= 2` and `Income.per.dependent > 3.5`, the application is `Accepted` (`prediction = 1`).
  - Otherwise, the application is `Rejected` (`prediction = 0`).

This function follows the structure of the decision tree while ensuring the returned truth values list reflects the path taken within the tree for a given set of input features.
