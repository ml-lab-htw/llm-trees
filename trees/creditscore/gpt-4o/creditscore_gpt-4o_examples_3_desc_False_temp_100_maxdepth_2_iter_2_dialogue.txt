Here is a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not, given the specified features. The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.0
    nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 300 if nodes[0] else None
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1 if not nodes[0] else None

    # Determine the prediction based on the evaluation of the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Class: Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Class: Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Class: Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Class: Rejected

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 400,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

pred, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function:
- The `nodes` list keeps track of whether the conditions for the inner nodes of the decision tree are satisfied.
- Node 0 checks if `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 5.0.
- Node 1 checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 300, but only if node 0's condition is true.
- Node 2 checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1, but only if node 0's condition is false.
- Based on the values of these nodes, the function determines the class (0 = no, 1 = yes) for the prediction.

You can use this function to classify new applications for credit by providing a dictionary with the features as input.
