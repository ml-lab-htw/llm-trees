Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function, according to the task description, which predicts whether a credit application is accepted (`1`) or rejected (`0`) and provides a list of `truth values` for the internal nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree for predicting credit application acceptance.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Input feature values with the following keys:
        - "Age": age in years.
        - "Income.per.dependent": income per dependent (1.5 to 10).
        - "Monthly.credit.card.exp": monthly credit card expenses ($).
        - "Own.home": whether the individual owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - "Self.employed": whether the individual is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - "Derogatory.reports": number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).
        
    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if application is accepted, 0 if rejected.
    nodes (list): Boolean evaluations (1/0) of the internal decision nodes.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [0]  # Pre-allocate list for 3 nodes.
    
    # Root node decision: Is Income.per.dependent <= 3.5?
    nodes[0] = int(X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5)  # 1 if condition is True, 0 otherwise.
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        # Node 1 decision: Is Age <= 25.0?
        nodes[1] = int(X["Age"] <= 25.0)
        if nodes[1]:  # Age <= 25.0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Age > 25.0
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        # Node 2 decision: Is Derogatory.reports <= 1?
        nodes[2] = int(X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1.0)
        if nodes[2]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1.0
            # Node 3 decision: Is Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500.0?
            if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500.0:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500.0
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1.0
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input (`X`)**:
   - The input is a dictionary containing values for the features: `'Age'`, `'Income.per.dependent'`, `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`, `'Own.home'`, `'Self.employed'`, and `'Derogatory.reports'`.

2. **Truth Values (`nodes`)**:
   - `nodes` is a list initialized with three elements as placeholders for the truth values of internal nodes.
   - A value of `1` means the condition of a node is satisfied, and `0` means the condition is not satisfied.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The decision-making process follows the structure of the earlier decision tree.
   - `nodes[0]`: The root node decision checks whether `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5`.
   - `nodes[1]`: For cases where `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5`, a secondary condition checks if `Age <= 25.0`.
   - `nodes[2]`: For cases where `Income.per.dependent > 3.5`, another decision evaluates whether `Derogatory.reports <= 1.0`.

4. **Prediction (`prediction`)**:
   - Based on the evaluations of the nodes, the function assigns a `prediction` value:
     - `1` for accepted applications.
     - `0` for rejected applications.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the `nodes` array.

### Example Usage:

#### Input:
```python
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300.0,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}
```

#### Call:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)     # Output: 1
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)   # Output: [0, 0, 1]
```

### Explanation of Output:
1. `Income.per.dependent > 3.5` → `nodes[0] = 0`
2. `Derogatory.reports <= 1.0` → `nodes[2] = 1`
3. `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500.0` → `Prediction = 1 (Accepted)`
