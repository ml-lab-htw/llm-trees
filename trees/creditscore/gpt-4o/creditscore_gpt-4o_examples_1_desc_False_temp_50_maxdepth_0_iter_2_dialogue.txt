Here is the Python function implementing a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for the credit application problem:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a credit application is accepted (1) or not (0) based on input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
            - 'Age': Age in years (numeric)
            - 'Income.per.dependent': Income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
            - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': Monthly credit card expenses in dollars (numeric)
            - 'Own.home': Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - 'Self.employed': Self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - 'Derogatory.reports': Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 1 if the application is accepted, 0 otherwise.
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if 'Income.per.dependent' is less than or equal to 3.5
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 3.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If income per dependent is <= 3.5, classify as not accepted (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'Monthly.credit.card.exp' is less than or equal to 500
        nodes[1] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 500
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If monthly credit card expenses are <= 500, classify as not accepted (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If monthly credit card expenses are > 500, classify as accepted (1)
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input (`X`)**: The input is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a feature, and the value is the feature's value for a given instance.
   - Example input: 
     ```python
     {
         "Age": 35,
         "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
         "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
         "Own.home": 1,
         "Self.employed": 0,
         "Derogatory.reports": 0
     }
     ```
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list contains truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) for the inner nodes of the decision tree. This allows us to track which conditions were satisfied during the decision process.
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The first condition (`nodes[0]`) checks if `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 3.5. If true, the application is classified as not accepted (`prediction = 0`).
   - If the first condition is false, the second condition (`nodes[1]`) checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 500. If true, the application is classified as not accepted (`prediction = 0`). Otherwise, it is classified as accepted (`prediction = 1`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output results
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [0, 0]
```

### Output for Example:
- **Prediction**: `1` (application accepted)
- **Nodes**: `[0, 0]` (both conditions were not satisfied, meaning income per dependent > 3.5 and monthly credit card expenses > 500).
