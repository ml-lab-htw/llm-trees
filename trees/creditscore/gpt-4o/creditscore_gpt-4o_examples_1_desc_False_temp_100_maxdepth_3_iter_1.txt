Here's a decision tree of depth 3 based on the Features you provided, along with the target variable (whether the application for credit is accepted or not):

### Features:
- **Age**: Age in years.
- **Income.per.dependent**: Income per dependent (range: 1.5 to 10).
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
- **Own.home**: Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed**: Self-employed status (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports**: Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

### Target:
- **target**: Application for credit is accepted (0 = no, 1 = yes).

### Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check income per dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0
    
    # Node 1: Check age if income per dependent is greater than 5.0
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 45
    
    # Node 2: Check monthly credit card expenses if age is under 45
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 1500

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High credit card expenses, young age, high income per dependent
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Lower credit card expenses, under 45, but still high income
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Age is above 45, but income per dependent is high
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Income per dependent is low, application is likely rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: If the income per dependent is more than $5.0, then we proceed to check the age.
2. **Node 1**: If the age is 45 or younger, we check the monthly credit card expenses.
3. **Node 2**: If the monthly credit card expenses are over $1500, the final prediction is that the credit application is likely accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.
4. If the income per dependent is less than or equal to $5.0, the application is likely rejected.

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 3, with 3 inner nodes.
