To create the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable, we need to implement the steps according to the logical splitting criteria we identified. We will return a prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the nodes' truth values list
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate conditions
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 6.0
    nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 2000
    nodes[3] = X['Own.home'] == 0
    nodes[4] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] > 3000

    # Make prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 7.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 2500,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Denied'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize a list called `nodes` with `None` values to store the truth values of the decision nodes.
2. Each node evaluates a condition and stores `True` (1) or `False` (0) in the respective position in the `nodes` list:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 6.0.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `Derogatory.reports` are greater than 0.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is greater than $2000.
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the applicant does not own a home (`Own.home` == 0).
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is greater than $3000.
3. Based on the truth values of these nodes, the function navigates through the decision tree to make a prediction:
   - If income per dependent is less than or equal to 6.0, it further checks derogatory reports and credit card expenses.
   - If income per dependent is greater than 6.0, it checks home ownership and then further checks credit card expenses if needed.
4. The function returns the prediction (0 for denied, 1 for accepted) and the list of truth values for the nodes. 

This function is designed to closely mirror the structured decision-making process we established, allowing it to classify new input data accurately.
