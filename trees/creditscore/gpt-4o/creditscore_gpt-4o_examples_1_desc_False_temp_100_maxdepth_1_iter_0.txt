Hereâ€™s a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 based on the Features you've provided and the new prediction target (`target: application for credit is accepted or not`).

### Features:
- **Age**: Age of the applicant (years).
- **Income.per.dependent**: Income per dependent (from 1.5 to 10).
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Monthly credit card expenses ($).
- **Own.home**: Whether the applicant owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed**: Whether the applicant is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports**: Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

### Target:
- **target**: Application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

### Decision Tree:
For this decision tree, let's assume that the most important feature in deciding whether a credit application is accepted or not is the number of **Derogatory.reports**. We will create a decision tree that splits based on whether the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1. If the applicant has fewer derogatory reports, they are more likely to be accepted for credit.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Application is accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application is not accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree has one inner node that checks the condition `X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1`.
- If the number of derogatory reports is 1 or fewer, the prediction is that the credit application is **accepted** (`1`).
- If the number of derogatory reports is greater than 1, the prediction is that the credit application is **not accepted** (`0`).
- The function returns both the prediction and a list containing the truth value of the condition at the inner node (`nodes`).

### Example of usage:

```python
# Example feature set
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 2
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Application not accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [False] (Condition was not satisfied)
```
