Here's how the decision tree (max depth 1) for the credit application example can be implemented as a Python function that outputs the prediction and a list of truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a credit application is accepted (1) or not (0) based on a decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - "Age": Age of the individual in years.
        - "Income.per.dependent": Income per dependent (1.5 to 10).
        - "Monthly.credit.card.exp": Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
        - "Own.home": Whether the individual owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - "Self.employed": Whether the individual is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - "Derogatory.reports": Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if credit application is accepted, 0 if rejected.
        - nodes (list): List of truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = [None]

    # Decision tree: Use Income.per.dependent as the feature to split
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If "Income.per.dependent" <= 3.0
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:  # If "Income.per.dependent" > 3.0
        prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

Here's an example of how this function could be used:

```python
# Example input
features = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 2.8,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

# Output the result
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

### Explanation of the Function:

- **`nodes` List**:
  - This list contains the evaluations of the inner nodes of the decision tree.
  - For a tree of depth 1, there is only one inner node (`Income.per.dependent <= 3.0`), so the list has one entry.
  - It is set to `1` if the condition is satisfied (`Income.per.dependent <= 3.0`) and `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction Logic**:
  - If `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 3.0, the application is rejected (prediction = 0).
  - Otherwise, the application is accepted (prediction = 1).

This implementation reflects a decision tree of maximum depth 1 where we evaluate only one feature, `Income.per.dependent`, to classify the outcome.
