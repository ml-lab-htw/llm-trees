Sure, based on the decision tree provided and the structure of the function examples, here is the Python function implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the conditions of the tree
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
        prediction = 1 if nodes[1] else 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Provided feature set
X_example = {
    'Age': 45,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 400,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'rejected'}")
print(f"Node evaluations: {nodes}")
```

In this function:
- `nodes[0]` checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1.
- If `nodes[0]` is `True`, the decision is further based on `Income.per.dependent`:
  - If `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 5, the application is accepted (prediction = 1).
  - Otherwise, it is rejected (prediction = 0).
- If `nodes[0]` is `False`, the decision is based on `Monthly.credit.card.exp`:
  - If `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 500, the application is accepted (prediction = 1).
  - Otherwise, it is rejected (prediction = 0).

This function returns a prediction based on the given feature set and a list representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied (`1` for True, `0` for False).
