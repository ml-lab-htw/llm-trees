Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree for the credit application problem based on the structure provided earlier. This function is designed to return a single prediction (0 = "not accepted", 1 = "accepted") as well as a list of truth values (0 or 1) for the conditions of each inner node in the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts if a credit application is accepted (1) or not (0) based on input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features:
        'Age': age in years,
        'Income.per.dependent': income per dependent (1.5 to 10),
        'Monthly.credit.card.exp': monthly credit card expenses ($),
        'Own.home': whether the applicant owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no),
        'Self.employed': whether the applicant is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no),
        'Derogatory.reports': number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

    Returns:
    int: The predicted class (0 = not accepted, 1 = accepted).
    list: A list of truth values for each inner node.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0 condition: Income.per.dependent <= 4.5
    nodes[0] = X['Income.per.dependent'] <= 4.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1 condition: Derogatory.reports > 2
        nodes[1] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        # Node 2 condition: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
        nodes[1] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 500
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3 condition: Own.home == 0 (does not own a home)
            nodes[2] = X['Own.home'] == 0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Nodes List**:
    - `nodes` keeps track of the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes.
    - `nodes[i]` evaluates to `True` (1) if the corresponding condition is satisfied and `False` (0) otherwise.

2. **Condition Checks**:
    - `Node 0`: Splits based on whether `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 4.5.
    - `Node 1` (left branch for `Income.per.dependent <= 4.5`): Checks if `Derogatory.reports` are greater than 2.
    - `Node 1` (right branch for `Income.per.dependent > 4.5`): Splits on whether `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to $500.
    - `Node 2` (right branch for `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= $500`): Splits on whether `Own.home` is 0 (does not own a home).

3. **Prediction**:
    - The prediction follows the structure of the decision tree. Based on the conditions at each node, the function makes the final decision of either `0` (not accepted) or `1` (accepted).

4. **Return Values**:
    - `prediction`: The predicted class label (0 or 1).
    - `nodes`: A list of truth values (1 or 0) indicating whether the conditions of each inner node were satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 400,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}

# Call the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Inner Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: Inner Node Truth Values: [False, True, False]
```

This example uses a hypothetical applicant with `Income.per.dependent` of 6.0, who owns a home and has one derogatory report but modest monthly credit card expenses. The result predicts their credit application would be accepted (`1`).
