To format the decision tree as a Python function, we will use the specified features and target variable encoding. Our decision tree will be built based on the following structure:

### Decision Tree Structure:
```
|--- number of derogatory reports <= 1.5
|    |--- income per dependent <= 3.5
|    |    |--- class: Not Accepted (0)
|    |--- income per dependent > 3.5
|    |    |--- class: Accepted (1)
|--- number of derogatory reports > 1.5
|    |--- class: Not Accepted (0)
```

### Python Function Implementation:
Here is the function `predict` that takes a dictionary of features and returns a prediction along with the list of truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: check number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node: check income per dependent
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation
1. **Root Node**: `Derogatory.reports` is checked first:
   - If `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1.5, move to check `Income.per.dependent`.
   - If `Derogatory.reports` is greater than 1.5, the application is not accepted (prediction = 0).
   
2. **First Level Node (if `Derogatory.reports` <= 1.5)**:
   - If `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 3.5, the application is not accepted (prediction = 0).
   - If `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 3.5, the application is accepted (prediction = 1).

This structure ensures that the decision tree is clear and follows the specified rules for depth, thresholds, and features. The function also returns the truth values of the inner nodes, helping to understand which conditions were met during the prediction process.
