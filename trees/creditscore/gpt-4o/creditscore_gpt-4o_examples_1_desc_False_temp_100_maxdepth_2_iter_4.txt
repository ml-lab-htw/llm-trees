Given the Features and target variable, I will induce a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using conditions based on the most important features. Here's the decision tree as a Python function:

Features:
- **age**: The age of the applicant (years).
- **Income.per.dependent**: The income per dependent (ranging from 1.5 to 10).
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
- **Own.home**: Whether the applicant owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed**: Whether the applicant is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports**: The number of derogatory credit reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

Target variable:
- **target**: Application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

Decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely to be accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** is based on the feature `Income.per.dependent`. If the income per dependent is greater than or equal to 5 (a relatively higher income), the applicant is more likely to be accepted for credit.
- **Node 1** is based on the feature `Derogatory.reports`. If the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1, the application is more likely to be accepted. Otherwise, it is more likely to be rejected.

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and consists of 2 inner nodes.
