Here's the implementation of the decision tree for predicting whether a credit application is accepted (target: `0 = no`, `1 = yes`). This function uses the exact feature names and encodings as specified, and it follows the logical structure of the decision tree provided earlier.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a credit application is accepted (0 = no, 1 = yes), and return 
    a list of truth values indicating the evaluation of each inner node.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features with keys:
            - 'Age'
            - 'Income.per.dependent'
            - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp'
            - 'Own.home'
            - 'Self.employed'
            - 'Derogatory.reports'

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction (int), nodes (list of int))
            - prediction (int): 0 if credit is rejected, 1 if credit is accepted
            - nodes (list of int): List of 0s and 1s indicating truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize the list to store truth values of nodes
    nodes = 6 * [None]  # Here, the tree has at most 6 nodes.

    # Node 0: Check number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1.5

    if nodes[0]:  # If number of derogatory reports <= 1.5
        # Node 1: Check income per dependent
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5

        if nodes[1]:  # If income per dependent <= 4.5
            # Outcome: Rejected
            prediction = 0

        else:  # If income per dependent > 4.5
            # Node 2: Check monthly credit card expenses
            nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500

            if nodes[2]:  # If monthly credit card expenses <= 500
                # Outcome: Rejected
                prediction = 0
            else:  # If monthly credit card expenses > 500
                # Outcome: Accepted
                prediction = 1

    else:  # If number of derogatory reports > 1.5
        # Node 3: Check owning a home
        nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1

        if nodes[3]:  # If owning a home == yes
            # Node 4: Check age
            nodes[4] = X["Age"] > 30

            if nodes[4]:  # If age > 30
                # Outcome: Accepted
                prediction = 1
            else:  # If age <= 30
                # Outcome: Rejected
                prediction = 0
        else:  # If owning a home == no
            # Outcome: Rejected
            prediction = 0

    # Replace all None entries in nodes with 0 (evaluated as not relevant)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage

Input a feature dictionary into the `predict()` function:

```python
# Example input where:
# - Age = 35
# - Income per dependent = 5.0
# - Monthly credit card expenses = 600
# - Own home = Yes (1)
# - Self employed = Yes (1) (though Self.employed is unused in this tree)
# - Derogatory reports = 1
features = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 1,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

# Call the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

# Print the result
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected: 1 (accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Expected: [1, 0, 0, ..., 0]
```

### Explanation of `nodes` Output
The list `nodes` tracks the truth values of inner nodes in the decision tree:
- `1` indicates the condition of the node is satisfied (True).
- `0` indicates the condition is not satisfied (False).

For this particular tree:
- `nodes[0]` corresponds to the check `X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1.5`.
- `nodes[1]` corresponds to the check `X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5`.
- `nodes[2]` corresponds to the check `X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500`.
- `nodes[3]` corresponds to the check `X["Own.home"] == 1`.
- `nodes[4]` corresponds to the check `X["Age"] > 30`.

Each node helps explain how the prediction was made.
