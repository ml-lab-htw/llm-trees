Based on your updated instructions, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree that mirrors the logic and structure of the example you provided. This decision tree will use the feature `Income.per.dependent` as the primary factor for prediction, with a meaningful threshold of `4.5`.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on the provided features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the required feature values:
        - 'Age': (int) Age of the applicant in years.
        - 'Income.per.dependent': (float) Income per dependent (ranges from 1.5 to 10).
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': (float) Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
        - 'Own.home': (int) Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - 'Self.employed': (int) Self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - 'Derogatory.reports': (int) Number of derogatory reports (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7).
        
    Returns:
    - prediction (int): The predicted class (0 = no, 1 = yes).
    - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = [None]  # Initialize list to track truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Check the condition for the first (and only) node in the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    
    # Make predictions based on the truth value of the condition
    if nodes[0]:
        # Condition satisfied: Income.per.dependent is <= 4.5
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Condition not satisfied: Income.per.dependent is > 4.5
        prediction = 1
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function expects a dictionary `X` with the exact feature names you described, e.g., `"Income.per.dependent"`, `"Age"`, and so on.
   
2. **Inner Node**: There is one inner node in this depth-1 tree, which checks if `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to `4.5`.

3. **Truth Values**:
   - The inner node's truth value is stored in a list called `nodes` (`[1]` if the condition is satisfied and `[0]` otherwise).

4. **Prediction**:
   - If the condition `Income.per.dependent <= 4.5` is `True`, the function predicts `0` (application rejected).
   - If the condition is `False`, the function predicts `1` (application accepted).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Input sample feature values
sample = {
    "Age": 45,
    "Income.per.dependent": 3.8,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 250,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(sample)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (application rejected)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

Another Example:
```python
# Another input
sample = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.6,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 400,
    "Own.home": 0,
    "Self.employed": 1,
    "Derogatory.reports": 2
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(sample)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (application accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0]
```
