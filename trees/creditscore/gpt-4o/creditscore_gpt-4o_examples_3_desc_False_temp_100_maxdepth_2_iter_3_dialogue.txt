Sure! Below, I have written a Python function named `predict` that follows your specifications. The function accepts a dictionary `X` with the features and returns a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*2
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1 if nodes[0] else X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```
With this function:

- `nodes[0]` checks if the `Income.per.dependent` feature is less than or equal to 5.5.
- `nodes[1]` is conditionally set depending on the value of `nodes[0]`. If `nodes[0]` is `True`, it checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, it checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 2.

This helps the function to return both a prediction (`0` for not accepted, `1` for accepted) and a list representing the truth value of each node.
