Hereâ€™s how I would implement the decision tree you requested as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Classify whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on input features.

    Args:
    X (dict): Features of the application. Keys must match:
        - 'Age': age (years)
        - 'Income.per.dependent': income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': monthly credit card expenses ($)
        - 'Own.home': owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Self.employed': self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Derogatory.reports': number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
    int: Prediction for the credit application (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
    list: Truth values of the inner nodes used for the decision.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store truth values for each node
    nodes = [None]

    # Evaluate the root node condition based on 'Derogatory.reports'
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2  # Condition: Is number of derogatory reports <= 2?

    # Decision making at depth 1
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
input_features = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 8,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1,
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)

# Print the result
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Truth values of nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True]
```

---

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Format**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys match the given feature names exactly. These must be provided as arguments when calling the function.
   
2. **Node Evaluation**: 
   - We have a single condition (at depth 1): whether "Derogatory.reports" is less than or equal to 2.
   - This condition determines the value of `nodes[0]`. If the condition is true, the application is classified as **Accepted**; otherwise, it is classified as **Rejected**.
   - The decision tree uses a threshold of `2` for "Derogatory.reports," which is a sensible cutoff based on credit risk (fewer reports = better creditworthiness).

3. **Return Values**:
   - `prediction`: The class label (0 = Rejected, 1 = Accepted).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the decision nodes. Since the max depth is 1, the list contains only one truth value (`nodes[0]`).

This implementation meets the requirements: uses the exact feature names and target encoding, evaluates a decision tree with depth 1, and outputs both the prediction and node truth values.
