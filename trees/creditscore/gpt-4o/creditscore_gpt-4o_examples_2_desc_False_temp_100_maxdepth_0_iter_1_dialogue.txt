Given the provided feature set and target variable, we can create a decision tree in Python that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Here is the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Create a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 6

    # Initialize the conditions for each node based on the features provided
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.5 if nodes[0] else False
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500 if nodes[0] and not nodes[1] else False
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1 if not nodes[0] else False
    nodes[4] = X["Age"] > 25 if not nodes[0] and nodes[3] else False
    nodes[5] = X["Own.home"] == 0 if not nodes[0] else False

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
                
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 300,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

result = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if result[0] == 1 else "Rejected")
print("Nodes:", result[1])
```

### Example Explanation:

1. **Nodes List**:
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 0.
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 3.5 (only if `nodes[0]` is True).
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 500 (only if `nodes[0]` is True and `nodes[1]` is False).
    - `nodes[3]`: Checks if `Own.home` is equal to 1 (only if `nodes[0]` is False).
    - `nodes[4]`: Checks if `Age` is greater than 25 (only if `nodes[0]` is False and `nodes[3]` is True).
    - `nodes[5]`: Checks if `Own.home` is equal to 0 (only if `nodes[0]` is False).

2. **Decision Path**:
    - If there are no derogatory reports and income per dependent is high enough (greater than 3.5), the application is accepted.
    - If income per dependent is not high enough, but monthly credit card expenses are low (less than or equal to 500), the application is accepted.
    - If there are derogatory reports, owning a home can sway the decision positively if the applicant is older than 25.
    - Not owning a home in the presence of derogatory reports leads to rejection.

This decision tree reflects a simple model to classify whether a credit application is accepted or not based on the features provided. The nodes list helps trace the decision-making process step by step.
