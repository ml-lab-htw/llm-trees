Here’s the Python function that implements the decision tree logic based on the provided feature names and example:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: If no derogatory reports, check income per dependent
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application rejected
    else:
        # Node 1: If derogatory reports exist, check monthly credit card expenses
        nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: Checks if the number of derogatory reports is ≤ 0 (i.e., no derogatory reports). If true, we move to the next check on income per dependent. If false (i.e., there are derogatory reports), we move to the next check on monthly credit card expenses.
  
- **Node 1**: 
  - If no derogatory reports, checks if income per dependent is greater than 3.0. A higher income per dependent suggests greater financial stability, and if true, the application is accepted. Otherwise, it's rejected.
  - If there are derogatory reports, checks if monthly credit card expenses are ≤ 1000. Lower expenses suggest the applicant may not be overspending and might still be accepted, while higher expenses would lead to rejection.

This function returns two things:
1. The **prediction** (0 = rejected, 1 = accepted).
2. A **list of nodes**, where each entry is `True` (1) or `False` (0), representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example applicant
applicant = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 800,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Prediction
result, nodes = predict(applicant)
print(f"Prediction: {result}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would print something like:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True]
```

Where:
- `Nodes[0] = True` indicates that the condition `Derogatory.reports <= 0` was satisfied.
- `Nodes[1] = True` indicates that the condition `Income.per.dependent > 3.0` was satisfied.
