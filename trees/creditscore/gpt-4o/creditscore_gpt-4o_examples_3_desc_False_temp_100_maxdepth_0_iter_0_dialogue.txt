Based on your request, I'll implement a decision tree classifier in Python for the credit application scenario. The function will return a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]
    
    # Evaluating each condition
    nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X['Income.per.dependent'] > 3
    nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 300
    nodes[3] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    nodes[4] = X['Derogatory.reports'] > 0.5
    nodes[5] = X['Self.employed'] == 0
    nodes[6] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 150
    nodes[7] = X['Own.home'] == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory reports <= 0.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Income per dependent > 3
            if nodes[2]:  # Monthly credit card expenses <= 300
                if nodes[3]:  # Owning a home
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:  # Not owning a home
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Monthly credit card expenses > 300
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # Income per dependent <= 3
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:  # Derogatory reports > 0.5
        if nodes[5]:  # Not self-employed
            if nodes[6]:  # Monthly credit card expenses <= 150
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:  # Monthly credit card expenses > 150
                if nodes[7]:  # Owning a home
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:  # Not owning a home
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:  # Self-employed
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 200,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Rejected'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes list** records the truth values of the inner nodes based on the given feature set.
- Conditions check specific features and store the result in the corresponding node.
- The decision tree logic then uses these nodes to navigate through the tree and finally make a prediction.

In this implemented function:
- If the **number of derogatory reports** is minimal (<= 0.5), the decision primarily relies on **income per dependent** and **monthly credit card expenses**.
- For higher derogatory reports (> 0.5), being **self-employed** and having higher **monthly credit card expenses** negatively affect the prediction unless the applicant owns a home.
