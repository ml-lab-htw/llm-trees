Here is a Python function that implements your decision tree classifier based on the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of nodes representing truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First decision node: number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1  

    # Second decision node: income per dependent
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0  
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1  # Owning a home
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]** checks if the number of **Derogatory.reports** is less than or equal to 1. If true, we move to the second decision node, otherwise, a different branch is followed.
2. **nodes[1]** in the first branch checks if the **Income.per.dependent** is greater than 4.0. If true, the application is accepted (prediction = 1), otherwise, it's not accepted (prediction = 0).
3. In the second branch, if **Derogatory.reports** is greater than 1, **nodes[1]** checks if the applicant **Owns a home**. If the applicant owns a home (value 1), the application is accepted (prediction = 1), otherwise, it's not accepted (prediction = 0).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Accepted)
print("Node Values:", nodes)      # Output: Node Values: [True, True]
```

This function provides both the final prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes used to make the prediction.
