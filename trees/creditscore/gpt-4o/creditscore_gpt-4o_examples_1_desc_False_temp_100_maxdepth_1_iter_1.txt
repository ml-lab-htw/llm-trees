Based on the Features and target variable, I will construct a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1, meaning it will have one inner node and two possible leaf nodes. Since we are not training this on actual data, I will choose the most important feature intuitively based on the description.

For this case, I will use "Income.per.dependent" as the most important feature, as it seems to directly relate to the ability to manage credit and could be a significant factor in the credit approval process.

Here is the Python function following your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Decision based on Income per dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 5.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Application for credit is accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application for credit is not accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Inner Node Condition:** The condition checks whether the "Income.per.dependent" is greater than or equal to 5.0. This threshold is chosen based on the idea that higher income per dependent suggests the applicant may be more financially stable and thus more likely to have their credit application accepted.
- **Leaf Nodes:** The decision tree has two possible outcomes:
  1. If "Income.per.dependent" is greater than or equal to 5.0, the prediction is `1` (application accepted).
  2. If "Income.per.dependent" is less than 5.0, the prediction is `0` (application not accepted).

### Usage Example:
```python
# Example of input features
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

# Get prediction and truth values for inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (application not accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False] (condition not satisfied)
```
