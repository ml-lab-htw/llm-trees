Based on the Features and the target variable you provided, the following decision tree could be constructed with a maximum depth of 3 and between 3 and 7 inner nodes. This tree is based on hypothetical importance of the features, as you requested not to train it on actual data.

Here is the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # There will be 3 decision nodes

    # Inner node conditions:
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] > 30
    nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] == 0
    
    # Decision tree logic:
    if nodes[0]:  # Income per dependent > 5.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Age > 30
            if nodes[2]:  # No derogatory reports
                prediction = 1  # Application accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
    else:  # Income per dependent <= 5.0
        if X["Own.home"] == 1:  # Owns home
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application not accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on `"Income.per.dependent"`. If the income per dependent is greater than 5.0, we move to the next decision; otherwise, we evaluate home ownership.
   
2. **Node 1**: If the income per dependent is higher than 5.0, we check if the applicant is older than 30. This captures the idea that older individuals with higher income per dependent may have a higher likelihood of acceptance.

3. **Node 2**: If the first two conditions are satisfied, we check the number of derogatory reports. Having no derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports == 0`) increases the likelihood of the application being accepted.

4. **Own.home**: If the `"Income.per.dependent"` is less than or equal to 5.0, but the applicant owns a home (`Own.home == 1`), the application may still be accepted.

### Example of usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code checks conditions in the decision tree in sequence and returns a prediction along with a list of the truth values for the inner nodes, which can be used for further analysis or debugging.
