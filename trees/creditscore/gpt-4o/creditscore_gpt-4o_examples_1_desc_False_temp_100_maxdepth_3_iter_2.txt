Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 based on the Features and target variable you've provided:

Features:
- `Age`: age (years)
- `Income.per.dependent`: income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
- `Monthly.credit.card.exp`: monthly credit card expenses ($)
- `Own.home`: owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `Self.employed`: self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `Derogatory.reports`: number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

Target:
- `target`: application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Decision tree structure:
- Root node: Monthly credit card expenses
- First level: Derogatory reports
- Second level: Income per dependent

### Decision Tree (Python Function)

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Monthly credit card expenses <= 500
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Derogatory reports <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Income per dependent > 3
            nodes[2] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Credit not accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit not accepted
    else:
        # Node 1: Age > 40
        nodes[1] = X["Age"] > 40
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Own home == 1
            nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Credit not accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Credit accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The root node checks if the monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $500.
   - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = True`), it checks the derogatory reports.
   - If **no** (`nodes[0] = False`), it checks the age.
   
2. **Node 1 (left)**: If the condition on monthly credit card expenses is satisfied, the next check is whether the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1.
   - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = True`), it checks the income per dependent.
   - If **no** (`nodes[1] = False`), the credit application is rejected.

3. **Node 1 (right)**: If the monthly credit card expenses are above $500, the tree checks if the applicant's age is greater than 40.
   - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = True`), it checks if the applicant owns a home.
   - If **no** (`nodes[1] = False`), the credit is accepted.

4. **Node 2**: The final decision is based on either income per dependent (for the left branch) or home ownership (for the right branch).

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 3 and three inner nodes, as requested.
