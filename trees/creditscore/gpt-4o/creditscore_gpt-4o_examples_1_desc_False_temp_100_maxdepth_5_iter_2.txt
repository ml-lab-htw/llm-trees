Based on the provided Features and target variable, I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 for predicting whether a credit application is accepted or not.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Split based on "Income.per.dependent"
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 4.5  # Income per dependent threshold
    
    # Node 1: Split based on "Monthly.credit.card.exp"
    nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 500  # Monthly credit card expenses threshold
    
    # Node 2: Split based on "Own.home"
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1  # Whether they own a home
    
    # Node 3: Split based on "Derogatory.reports"
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] == 0  # No derogatory reports
    
    # Node 4: Split based on "Self.employed"
    nodes[4] = X["Self.employed"] == 1  # Whether they are self-employed
    
    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent >= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports == 0
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application rejected
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Derogatory.reports == 0
                    prediction = 0  # Application rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # Self.employed == 1
                prediction = 1  # Application accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application rejected
    else:  # Income.per.dependent < 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Application accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:

1. **Node 0**: The initial split is based on the feature "Income.per.dependent". If the income per dependent is greater than or equal to 4.5, the decision goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left.
   
2. **Node 1**: Based on the "Monthly.credit.card.exp" feature, the decision is further split. If monthly credit card expenses are greater than 500 dollars, it goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left.

3. **Node 2**: This node checks if the individual owns a home. If they do own a home (Own.home == 1), the decision goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left.

4. **Node 3**: This node checks for the presence of derogatory reports. If there are no derogatory reports (Derogatory.reports == 0), the decision goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left.

5. **Node 4**: This node checks if the individual is self-employed. If they are self-employed (Self.employed == 1), the decision goes to the right; otherwise, it goes to the left.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and inner node values
prediction, node_values = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Application accepted)
print(f"Node values: {node_values}")  # Output: [True, True, True, True, False]
```

In this example, the decision tree predicts that the credit application will be **accepted** (prediction = 1), and the inner node splits are represented as `[True, True, True, True, False]`.
