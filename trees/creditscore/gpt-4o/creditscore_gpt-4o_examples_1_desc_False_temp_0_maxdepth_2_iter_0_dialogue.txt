Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts whether an application for credit is accepted (1) or not (0) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not based on the decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'Age': age (years)
        - 'Income.per.dependent': income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': monthly credit card expenses ($)
        - 'Own.home': owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Self.employed': self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Derogatory.reports': number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if the application is not accepted, 1 if it is accepted.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    # Node 1: Derogatory.reports <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
        prediction = 0  # Not accepted
    else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if the monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $500. If true, the application is not accepted (`prediction = 0`).
2. If **Node 0** is false (expenses > $500), **Node 1** checks if the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1. If true, the application is accepted (`prediction = 1`); otherwise, it is not accepted (`prediction = 0`).

This function adheres to the structure of a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 and uses meaningful thresholds for the splits.
