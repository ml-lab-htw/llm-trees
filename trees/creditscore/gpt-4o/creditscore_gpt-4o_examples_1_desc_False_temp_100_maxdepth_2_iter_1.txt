Here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 based on the Features and target variable you provided:

### Features:
- **Age**: Age of the individual (years)
- **Income.per.dependent**: Income per dependent ($) (1.5 to 10)
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Monthly credit card expenses ($)
- **Own.home**: Whether the individual owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Self.employed**: Whether the individual is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Derogatory.reports**: Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

### Target:
- **target**: Whether the credit application is accepted (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner Node 1: Check if the applicant has derogatory reports <= 1
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    # Inner Node 2: If the applicant owns a home, they're more likely to get approved
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Derogatory reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Owns a home
            prediction = 1  # Application is accepted
        else:  # Does not own a home
            prediction = 0  # Application is not accepted
    else:  # Derogatory reports > 1
        prediction = 0  # Application is not accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the applicant has **1 or fewer derogatory reports** (`Derogatory.reports <= 1`). If true, the tree goes to the second node. Otherwise, the prediction is that the credit application will be **rejected**.
- **Node 1**: If the applicant has **1 or fewer derogatory reports** and **owns a home** (`Own.home == 1`), the prediction is that the credit application will be **accepted**. Otherwise, the prediction is **rejected**.

This decision tree uses the most important features based on common credit approval factors and is constrained to a depth of 2, as requested.
