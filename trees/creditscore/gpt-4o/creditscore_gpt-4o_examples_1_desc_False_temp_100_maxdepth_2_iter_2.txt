Given the Features and target variable, I'm going to create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. Based on the feature descriptions, we will focus on the most seemingly important features for a credit application decision, such as **Income.per.dependent**, **Monthly.credit.card.exp**, and **Derogatory.reports**.

Here’s a possible decision tree logic:

- First, check the **Income.per.dependent**. A higher income per dependent is likely associated with better financial stability, which could increase the likelihood of a credit application being accepted.
- Second, check the **Derogatory.reports**. More derogatory reports (which indicate negative credit history) might decrease the likelihood of credit acceptance.
- Finally, we use **Monthly.credit.card.exp** as another condition. Higher credit card expenses without sufficient income or positive credit history might indicate financial strain.

This decision tree will use these three features, but to maintain a maximum depth of 2, we'll only use two features within the tree structure.

Here is the resulting Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First inner node: Check Income per dependent
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 3.5  # Threshold chosen assuming 3.5 is a reasonable cutoff for financial stability
    
    # Second inner node: Check Derogatory reports if income per dependent is high enough
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1  # Acceptance decreases with more derogatory reports
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # likely to get accepted (income is decent and few derogatory reports)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # rejected due to derogatory reports
    else:
        # If income per dependent is low, use Monthly Credit Card Expenses to decide
        nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000  # Higher expenses with low income -> rejected
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # rejected due to low income, even if expenses are controlled
        else:
            prediction = 1  # might still get accepted despite low income if expenses are very low

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inner Node 1 (`nodes[0]`)**: The decision tree first checks if the **Income.per.dependent** is greater than or equal to 3.5. This threshold is chosen assuming that families with an income per dependent below 3.5 might struggle with financial stability, while those above this threshold have better stability.
   
2. **Inner Node 2 (`nodes[1]`)**:
   - If the income per dependent is adequate (≥ 3.5), the model checks the number of **Derogatory.reports**. If the number of derogatory reports is ≤ 1, the application is likely to be accepted (prediction = 1). Otherwise, it's rejected (prediction = 0).
   
   - If the income per dependent is less than 3.5, the model checks the **Monthly.credit.card.exp**. If monthly expenses are ≤ 1000, it's more likely to reject the application (prediction = 0) due to low income, but if expenses are controlled (> 1000), the system may still accept the application (prediction = 1).

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "Age": 34,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.2,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes activated:", nodes)
```

This structure provides a simple but interpretable decision-making process for whether a credit application is accepted or not, based on the provided features.
