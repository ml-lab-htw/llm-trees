Here is the Python function for your specific decision tree using the provided feature keys, feature descriptions, and target variable encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the application for credit is accepted or not based on a decision tree of depth 1.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
            - 'Age': Age of the applicant in years.
            - 'Income.per.dependent': Income per dependent as a numeric value (1.5 to 10).
            - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
            - 'Own.home': Whether the applicant owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
            - 'Self.employed': Whether the applicant is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
            - 'Derogatory.reports': Number of derogatory credit reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): Whether the application is accepted (1 = accepted, 0 = not accepted).
            - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes in the form of 0 (False) or 1 (True).
    """

    # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the nodes
    nodes = [None]

    # Internal decision condition based on "Monthly.credit.card.exp"
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000  # Replace 1000 with a meaningful threshold if needed.

    # Decision based on the result of the first node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. The tree uses **"Monthly.credit.card.exp"** as the deciding feature (most important feature for this example).
2. The condition (`X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000`) splits the data into two groups:
   - If the monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $1,000, the application is **not accepted** (`0`).
   - Otherwise, the application is **accepted** (`1`).
3. `nodes` is a list that records whether the condition of the node was satisfied (1 = True, 0 = False). In this tree:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the root condition (`X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
input_data = {
    "Age": 34,
    "Income.per.dependent": 7.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1200,
    "Own.home": 1,  # Owns a home
    "Self.employed": 0,  # Not self-employed
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(input_data)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)  # Output: [0] (False: condition not satisfied)
```

### Explanation of Output:
- **Prediction**: The credit application is accepted (target = 1).
- **Nodes truth values**: `[0]`, which means the condition `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 1000` was **not satisfied**.

This simple framework can be easily expanded if you decide to include deeper decision trees or more complex conditions.
