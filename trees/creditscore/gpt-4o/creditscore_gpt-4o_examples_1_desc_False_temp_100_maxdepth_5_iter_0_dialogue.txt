Below is a Python implementation of a decision tree function based on your instructions and the given feature descriptions. The function uses thresholds that are meaningful based on the ranges provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a credit application is accepted (1) or not (0)
    based on the input features in X.
    
    Features:
    Age: age (years)
    Income.per.dependent: income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
    Monthly.credit.card.exp: monthly credit card expenses ($)
    Own.home: owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    Self.employed: self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    Derogatory.reports: number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary of feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the predicted class (0 = no, 1 = yes) and a list of
           truth values (1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    # Initialize a list to hold the truth values for each node (depth 5)
    nodes = [None] * 5

    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 1000
    nodes[4] = X["Self.employed"] == 0

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports <= 2
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                if nodes[3]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 1000
                    if nodes[4]:  # Self.employed == 0
                        prediction = 1  # Approved
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Denied
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Approved
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Denied
    else:
        if nodes[3]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 1000
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Approved
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Denied
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Denied

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **`Income.per.dependent` > 3.0**: Individuals with higher income per dependent are more likely to be approved.
2. **`Derogatory.reports` <= 2**: Having fewer derogatory reports improves the chances of approval.
3. **`Own.home` == 1**: Owning a home is a positive indicator for creditworthiness.
4. **`Monthly.credit.card.exp` > 1000**: Higher monthly credit card expenses could indicate good credit history but might also be a risk factor in some cases.
5. **`Self.employed` == 0**: Being employed by a company (not self-employed) suggests more stable income.

### Example Inputs and Outputs:
#### **Input 1:**
```python
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1,
}
```

#### **Output 1:**
```python
(1, [True, True, True, True, True])  # Prediction: Approved
```

#### **Input 2:**
```python
X = {
    "Age": 50,
    "Income.per.dependent": 2.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 700,
    "Own.home": 0,
    "Self.employed": 1,
    "Derogatory.reports": 3,
}
```

#### **Output 2:**
```python
(0, [False, False, False, False, False])  # Prediction: Denied
```

You can copy and paste this function into your Python codebase and use it to make predictions while checking which conditions (nodes) were satisfied!
