Based on the Features and the Target variable, I will now construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 using the most important feature. Since no actual training data is provided, I will assume income per dependent is a key feature for deciding whether the credit application is accepted or not. Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Decision rule: If income per dependent is greater than 5, accept the credit application (1), else reject (0)
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision is based on whether "Income.per.dependent" is greater than 5.
- If `Income.per.dependent > 5`, the credit application is accepted (returns 1).
- Otherwise, the credit application is rejected (returns 0).
- The `nodes` list contains the boolean value of the inner node's condition (whether `Income.per.dependent > 5` is true or false). 

This is a simple decision tree with a depth of 1, as required.
