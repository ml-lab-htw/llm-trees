Let's create the decision tree classifier as a Python function based on the features provided. This function will take a dictionary `X` of feature values as input and return a prediction (1 = accepted, 0 = rejected) along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Firstly, let's review the feature keys provided and our decision tree structure:

### Features:
- **Age**: age (years)
- **Income.per.dependent**: income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: monthly credit card expenses ($)
- **Own.home**: owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Self.employed**: self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Derogatory.reports**: number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

### Decision Tree Structure:
We will place the decision tree thresholds and build the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 300 if X["Own.home"] == 0 else None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # accepted
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # rejected
    else:
        prediction = 0  # rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 250,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Derogatory.reports <= 2**: If true, proceeds to the next check; otherwise, prediction is 0 (rejected).
2. **Income.per.dependent > 4.5**: If true, proceeds to the next check; otherwise, prediction is 0 (rejected).
3. **Own.home == 1**: If true, prediction is 1 (accepted); otherwise, checks the `Monthly.credit.card.exp` condition.
4. **Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 300**: If true, prediction is 1 (accepted); otherwise, prediction is 0 (rejected).

This function adheres to the decision logic provided and returns the prediction along with a list of nodes representing the truth values through the decision path taken.
