Based on the Features and target variable you've provided, I'll construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using 2-3 inner nodes to make the prediction. Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree:

### Decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Income per dependent <= 4.0
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.0
    
    # Node 1: Monthly credit card expenses <= 2000
    nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 2000
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            # Prediction: Credit application is likely rejected
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Prediction: Credit application is likely accepted
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # Prediction: Credit application is likely accepted
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the "Income per dependent." If it is less than or equal to 4.0, we proceed to the second check (Node 1). Otherwise, the credit application is likely accepted.
   
2. **Node 1**: If "Income per dependent" is less than or equal to 4.0, we check the "Monthly credit card expenses." If these expenses are less than or equal to $2000, the credit application is likely rejected. Otherwise, it's accepted.

### How to use the function:
You can use this function by passing a dictionary `X` containing the required features. Here's an example:

```python
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 3.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This will output:
- **Prediction:** 0 (Credit application rejected)
- **Nodes:** `[True, True]` (Both conditions were satisfied).

### Notes:
- The decision tree uses only two important features: `Income.per.dependent` and `Monthly.credit.card.exp`, as these might be key factors in evaluating whether a credit application is accepted.
