Given the provided features and the example formats, let's write a Python function for our decision tree model that predicts whether an application for credit is accepted and provides the corresponding node values indicating whether the conditions were met.

We'll assume the following thresholds for the decision tree structure we discussed earlier:
- Income per dependent threshold: 5.5
- Number of derogatory reports threshold: 1
- Owning a home: Binary value (1 for yes, 0 for no)

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if income per dependent is <= 5.5
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if number of derogatory reports is <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if owning a home (Own.home == 1)
        nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
            
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {
#     'Age': 35,
#     'Income.per.dependent': 6,
#     'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 500,
#     'Own.home': 1,
#     'Self.employed': 0,
#     'Derogatory.reports': 0
# }
# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print(f"Prediction: {'Accepted' if prediction == 1 else 'Rejected'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0 check**: We first check whether the "Income.per.dependent" is less than or equal to 5.5.
2. **Node 1 check (if Node 0 is true)**: If the income per dependent condition is satisfied, we then check whether the "Derogatory.reports" is less than or equal to 1.
    - If both conditions are true, we predict that the application is **accepted** (1).
    - If the number of derogatory reports is higher than 1, we predict the application is **rejected** (0).
3. **Node 1 check (if Node 0 is false)**: If the income per dependent condition is not satisfied, we move to checking whether the applicant owns a home.
    - If the applicant owns a home, we predict the application is **accepted** (1).
    - If the applicant does not own a home, we predict the application is **rejected** (0).

The function returns the prediction (1 for accepted, 0 for rejected) and a list of the truth values of the inner nodes. This list can be used to trace the decision path.
