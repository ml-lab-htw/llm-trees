Here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier that meets your requirements, including prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The tree structure is based on the most important features and has a maximum depth of 2. We'll use meaningful thresholds for "Income.per.dependent" and "Monthly.credit.card.exp":

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Class: accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Class: rejected
    else:
        if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000:
            prediction = 1  # Class: accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Class: rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Features**:
    - `'Income.per.dependent'`: Income per dependent (range: 1.5 to 10)
    - `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`: Monthly credit card expenses ($)
  
2. **Nodes**:
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `'Income.per.dependent'` is less than or equal to 5.5.
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'` is less than or equal to $500.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
    - If `nodes[0]` (Income.per.dependent <= 5.5) is True:
        - Then it checks `nodes[1]` (Monthly.credit.card.exp <= $500).
        - If `nodes[1]` is True, the prediction is accepted (1).
        - If `nodes[1]` is False, the prediction is rejected (0).
    - If `nodes[0]` is False (Income.per.dependent > 5.5):
        - Then it checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to $1000.
        - If True, the prediction is accepted (1).
        - If False, the prediction is rejected (0).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Sample input as a dictionary
sample_input = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 700,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}

# Get prediction and node values
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f'Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}')
```

This function should work correctly with the specified feature names and logic. The thresholds used (5.5 for `Income.per.dependent` and 500/1000 for `Monthly.credit.card.exp`) are placeholders and can be adjusted based on further data analysis.
