Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: based on the number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0.5
    
    # Second split: if no/low derogatory reports, we check income per dependent
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Credit is accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit is not accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Credit is not accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes as input a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names exactly as you provided them (e.g., `"Age"`, `"Income.per.dependent"`, etc.).
- The `nodes` list records the truth values of the conditions at each decision node in the tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: This checks whether the number of **Derogatory.reports** is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., whether the applicant has no derogatory reports).
  - `nodes[1]`: If the first condition is satisfied (i.e., the applicant has no derogatory reports), the second condition checks whether **Income.per.dependent** is greater than 4.5 to determine if the credit will be accepted.
- The function returns two things:
  1. `prediction`: The prediction of whether the credit application is accepted (`1` for accepted, `0` for not accepted).
  2. `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing whether each condition at the decision nodes was satisfied (`True` or `False`).

### Example usage:
```python
X = {
    "Age": 45,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output:
```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [True, True]
```

This means the credit application is **accepted** because the applicant has no derogatory reports and has an income per dependent greater than 4.5.
