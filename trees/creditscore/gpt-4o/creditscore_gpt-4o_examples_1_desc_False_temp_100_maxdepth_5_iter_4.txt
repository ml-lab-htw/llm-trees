Here is the decision tree based on the Features and prediction target you provided with a maximum depth of 5:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: First check based on Monthly Credit Card Expenses
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 2000

    # Node 1: Check based on Income per Dependent
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.5

    # Node 2: Check if the applicant owns a home
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1

    # Node 3: Check the number of derogatory reports
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] < 2

    # Node 4: Check if the applicant is self-employed
    nodes[4] = X["Self.employed"] == 1

    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # High monthly credit card expenses
        if nodes[1]:  # High income per dependent
            if nodes[2]:  # Owns a home
                if nodes[3]:  # Few derogatory reports
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:  # Many derogatory reports
                    prediction = 0  # Application rejected
            else:  # Does not own a home
                if nodes[4]:  # Self-employed
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application rejected
        else:  # Low income per dependent
            prediction = 0  # Application rejected
    else:  # Low monthly credit card expenses
        if nodes[2]:  # Owns a home
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
        else:  # Does not own a home
            prediction = 0  # Application rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first decision is based on whether the applicant's monthly credit card expenses exceed $2000. This could be an indicator of their spending capacity and financial management.
- **Node 1**: If the monthly credit card expenses are high, we further check if the income per dependent is greater than 5.5. This helps evaluate if the applicant has a stable financial background.
- **Node 2**: If the income per dependent is high, we check if the applicant owns a home, which could be a sign of financial stability.
- **Node 3**: For applicants who own a home, the next check is on the number of derogatory reports (less than 2). Fewer derogatory reports may indicate good credit behavior.
- **Node 4**: If the applicant does not own a home but is self-employed, they are still likely to have their application accepted.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 2500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function will return the prediction (whether the credit application is accepted or not) along with a list of truth values representing the evaluation of each inner node condition.
