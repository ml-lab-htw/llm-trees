Here is a decision tree for the Features and target variable with a maximum depth of 1:

### Features:
- **age**: Age of the individual in years.
- **Income.per.dependent**: Income per dependent, ranging from 1.5 to 10.
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: Monthly credit card expenses in dollars.
- **Own.home**: Indicates whether the individual owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Self.employed**: Indicates whether the individual is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **Derogatory.reports**: Number of derogatory reports on the individual's credit history (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

### Target variable:
- **target**: Whether the application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

### Decision tree:
Given the features, let's assume the most important feature is **Derogatory.reports** (a higher number of derogatory reports could lead to a rejection of credit applications).

If the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1, the credit application is likely accepted. Otherwise, it is likely rejected.

### Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision based on number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Credit application accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Credit application rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the dictionary contains the feature values for a given individual.
- The decision tree checks whether the number of derogatory reports (`Derogatory.reports`) is less than or equal to 1.
  - If the condition is satisfied (i.e., the person has 1 or fewer derogatory reports), the credit application is **accepted** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If the condition is **not** satisfied (i.e., the person has more than 1 derogatory report), the credit application is **rejected** (`prediction = 0`).
- The function also returns a list `nodes` that contains the truth value (`True` or `False`, represented as `1` or `0`) of the inner node condition.

### Example usage:
```python
applicant_data = {
    "age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(applicant_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this case, the prediction would be `0` (credit application rejected) since the number of derogatory reports is greater than 1. The `nodes` list would be `[0]` because the condition `Derogatory.reports <= 1` is not satisfied.
