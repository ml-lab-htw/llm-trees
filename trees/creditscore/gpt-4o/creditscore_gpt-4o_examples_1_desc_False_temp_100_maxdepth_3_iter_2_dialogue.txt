Here’s the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for credit applications based on the features and target variable description you provided. This function returns the predicted class (`0` or `1`) and a list of truth values corresponding to the decision tree's inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to store the truth values of the conditions at each node
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # First branch: Income.per.dependent <= 3.0
        # Node 1: Derogatory.reports > 2.0
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2.0
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory reports > 2.0
            prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
        else:  # Derogatory reports <= 2.0
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
            
    else:  # Second branch: Income.per.dependent > 3.0
        # Node 2: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500.0
        nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500.0
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Monthly credit card expenses <= 500.0
            # Node 3: Own.home == 0 (does not own home)
            nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 0
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Doesn't own a home
                prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
            else:  # Owns a home
                prediction = 1  # Application accepted
        else:  # Monthly credit card expenses > 500.0
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function
1. The function accepts `X` as input, which is a dictionary containing the feature values. For example:
   ```python
   X = {
       "Age": 35,
       "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
       "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600.0,
       "Own.home": 1,
       "Self.employed": 0,
       "Derogatory.reports": 1
   }
   ```

2. The `nodes` list stores the truth values calculated at each decision node:
   - `nodes[0]`: Represents whether `Income.per.dependent <= 3.0`.
   - `nodes[1]`: Depends on the branch taken; for example, it could represent either `Derogatory.reports > 2.0` or `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500.0` depending on the path in the tree.
   - `nodes[2]`: Represents whether `Own.home == 0` for a specific branch in the second major split.
   
3. The function traverses the decision tree in a structured, nested way to make a prediction for the class and to populate the truth values in `nodes`.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 2.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 300.0,
    "Own.home": 0,
    "Self.employed": 1,
    "Derogatory.reports": 3
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 for not accepted, 1 for accepted
print("Decision truth values:", nodes)  # [True, True, None]
```

### Example Output:
For the above input:
- `nodes[0]`: `2.5 <= 3.0` → `True`
- `nodes[1]`: `3 > 2.0` → `True`
- `nodes[2]`: Not evaluated because the first branch produced a prediction before reaching it.

Final prediction: `0` (application not accepted). Truth values of the nodes: `[True, True, None]`.

This approach ensures the function follows the decision-tree logic with a maximum depth of 3, and the `nodes` output represents the sequence of decisions made during the prediction process.
