Given the Features and target variable, here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 (containing up to 15 inner nodes) that predicts whether an application for credit is accepted (0 = no, 1 = yes). The decision tree is formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Income per dependent is greater than 4.5
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    
    # Node 1: Check if Monthly credit card expenses are greater than $1500
    nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 1500
    
    # Node 2: Check if the applicant owns a home
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Check if Age is greater than 35 years
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 35
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High income, high expenses, owns home, older -> likely accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # High income, high expenses, owns home, younger -> likely rejected
            else:
                prediction = 0  # High income, high expenses, doesn't own home -> likely rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High income, low expenses, owns home, older -> likely accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # High income, low expenses, owns home, younger -> likely accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # High income, low expenses, doesn't own home -> likely rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Low income, high expenses, owns home, older -> likely rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low income, high expenses, owns home, younger -> likely rejected
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low income, high expenses, doesn't own home -> likely rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Low income, low expenses, owns home, older -> likely accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low income, low expenses, owns home, younger -> likely rejected
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low income, low expenses, doesn't own home -> likely rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: First, check if the `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 4.5. This helps differentiate between higher-income and lower-income applicants.
2. **Node 1**: Then, check if the `Monthly.credit.card.exp` (monthly credit card expenses) is greater than $1500. Higher expenses may indicate financial instability or higher credit risk.
3. **Node 2**: Next, check if the applicant `Own.home`. Owning a home can be a sign of financial stability.
4. **Node 3**: Finally, check if the applicantâ€™s `Age` is over 35. Older applicants might have more established credit histories, which could affect the decision.

The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the nodes (`nodes` list). The nodes list will have 1 if the condition at that node is satisfied, and 0 otherwise.
