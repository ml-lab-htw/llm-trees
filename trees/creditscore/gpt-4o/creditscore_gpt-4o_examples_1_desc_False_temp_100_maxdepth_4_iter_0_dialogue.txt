Here is the Python function to implement the credit application decision tree based on your specifications. It uses the feature keys and target variable encoding correctly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether an application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).
    Also returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary with the following keys:
        - 'Age' (int): Age in years.
        - 'Income.per.dependent' (float): Income per dependent (1.5 to 10).
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp' (float): Monthly credit card expenses in $.
        - 'Own.home' (int): Owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - 'Self.employed' (int): Self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - 'Derogatory.reports' (int): Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

    Returns:
    int: Prediction (0 = not accepted, 1 = accepted).
    list: Truth values for the inner nodes of the tree.
    """
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Income per dependent <= 2.5
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 2.5
    
    # Node 1: Number of derogatory reports > 1
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 1
    
    # Node 2: Own home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 0  # True if does NOT own a home
    
    # Node 3: Age <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] <= 25
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 2.5
        prediction = 0  # Not accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 2.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 1
            if nodes[2]:  # Does NOT own a home
                if X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 700:  # Monthly credit card expenses > $700
                    prediction = 0  # Not accepted
                else:  # Monthly credit card expenses <= $700
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Owns a home
                if nodes[3]:  # Age <= 25
                    prediction = 0  # Not accepted
                else:  # Age > 25
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

```python
X_test = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 3.2,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 450,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")  # Output: [False, False, False, False]
```

### Decision Tree Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if `Income.per.dependent` is ≤ 2.5. If true, the application is rejected (0).
2. **Node 1**: If `Income.per.dependent > 2.5`, evaluate `Derogatory.reports`. If > 1 (too many derogatory reports), reject the application (0).
3. **Node 2**: If `Derogatory.reports ≤ 1`, check home ownership (`Own.home`). If doesn't own a home (`Own.home == 0`), proceed to evaluate monthly credit card expenses:
   - If expenses > $700, reject (0).
   - If expenses ≤ $700, accept (1).
4. **Node 3**: If the applicant owns a home (`Own.home == 1`), evaluate age:
   - If age ≤ 25, reject (0).
   - If age > 25, accept (1). 

This function dynamically evaluates each inner node and provides both a prediction and a list of truth values for interpretability.
