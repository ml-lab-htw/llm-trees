Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 for the Features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if income per dependent is greater than 5.0
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0

    # Node 1: Check if credit card expenses are greater than $200
    nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 200

    # Node 2: Check if age is greater than 40 years
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 40

    # Node 3: Check if the person owns a home
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1

    # Node 4: Check if there are more than 2 derogatory reports
    nodes[4] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Likely to be accepted
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Likely to be accepted
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Likely to be accepted
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Likely to be accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Likely to be accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely to be rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the income per dependent is greater than 5.0. Higher income per dependent suggests a higher likelihood of credit approval.
- **Node 1** checks if monthly credit card expenses are greater than $200. A higher expense amount may indicate good credit usage, but it could also indicate financial strain.
- **Node 2** checks if age is greater than 40 years. Older applicants may have more stable financial histories.
- **Node 3** checks if the applicant owns a home. Home ownership is often viewed favorably in credit applications.
- **Node 4** checks if the applicant has more than 2 derogatory reports, which is a strong negative factor in credit approval.

The decision tree is structured to make a prediction based on these conditions with a maximum depth of 5. The `nodes` list keeps track of which conditions were satisfied during the decision-making process for tracing purposes.
