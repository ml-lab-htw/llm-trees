Hereâ€™s the Python function representing the decision tree for credit application approval. It makes predictions (`0 = not accepted, 1 = accepted`) and returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict_credit_application(X):
    # Initialize a list to store node truth values (0 = not satisfied, 1 = satisfied)
    nodes = 10 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree conditions based on features
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 25
        if nodes[1]:  # Age <= 25
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
        else:  # Age > 25
            nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 0  # Does not own a home
            if nodes[2]:  # Own.home == 0
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted
            else:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
        if nodes[3]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
            nodes[4] = X["Derogatory.reports"] >= 1
            if nodes[4]:  # Derogatory.reports >= 1
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted
            else:  # Derogatory.reports < 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
            nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 0  # Not self-employed
            if nodes[5]:  # Self.employed == 0
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted
            else:  # Self.employed == 1
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    # Return the prediction and the list of node truth values
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. The function accepts a dictionary `X` where each key corresponds to a feature:
   - `'Age'`, `'Income.per.dependent'`, `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`, `'Own.home'`, `'Self.employed'`, `'Derogatory.reports'`.

2. The decision tree contains 6 decision nodes:
   - Node 0: `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5`
   - Node 1: `Age <= 25` (only checked if Node 0 is `True`).
   - Node 2: `Own.home == 0` (only checked if Node 1 is `False`).
   - Node 3: `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500` (only checked if Node 0 is `False`).
   - Node 4: `Derogatory.reports >= 1` (only checked if Node 3 is `True`).
   - Node 5: `Self.employed == 0` (only checked if Node 3 is `False`).

3. A list `nodes` tracks whether each node condition is satisfied (`1 = True`, `0 = False`).

4. The function returns:
   - `prediction`: `1` if the application is accepted, `0` otherwise.
   - `nodes`: A list of length 10 containing the truth values (`1` or `0`) for each node (unused nodes will remain `None`).

### Example Usage
```python
# Example features
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 400,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get the prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict_credit_application(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, None, None, True, False, None, None, None, None, None]
```

In this example:
- `Income.per.dependent > 3.5` (node 0 is `False`).
- `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500` (node 3 is `True`).
- `Derogatory.reports < 1` (node 4 is `False`).

So, the credit application is accepted (`prediction = 1`).
