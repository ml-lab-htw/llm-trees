Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4, created based on the features you've provided and the Target variable (application for credit is accepted or not). This tree will use conditions based on the available features and return a prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree conditions based on the features provided:
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0  # First decision based on income per dependent
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] > 35                    # Second decision based on age
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 3000  # Third decision based on credit card expenses
    nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1     # Fourth decision based on derogatory reports

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Credit rejected
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Credit rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Credit rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Credit rejected
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Credit rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]:** First checks if the income per dependent is greater than 5.0. If yes, moves to the next condition; if no, goes to the alternative branch.
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if the age is greater than 35. Age can be a factor for credit acceptance as older individuals may have more stable income and assets.
- **nodes[2]:** Checks if monthly credit card expenses are greater than 3000. High expenses could be a red flag for credit applications.
- **nodes[3]:** Checks if the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1. A lower number of derogatory reports indicates a better credit history.

### Prediction:
- The tree evaluates the conditions and based on the path taken through the nodes, it assigns a prediction of either `1` (credit accepted) or `0` (credit rejected).
  
### Example:
```python
X = {
    "Age": 40,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 3500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```

In this example, the individual satisfies all the conditions in the decision tree, resulting in a prediction that their credit application is accepted (prediction = 1). The truth values of the nodes are all `True`, meaning all conditions were satisfied.
