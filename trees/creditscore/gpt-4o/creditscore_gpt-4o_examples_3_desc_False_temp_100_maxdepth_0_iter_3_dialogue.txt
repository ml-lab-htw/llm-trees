Here is the Python function fulfilling your requirements. This function utilizes the given features to predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not, and it also returns a list of the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0
    nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 2000

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# input_features = {
#     'Age': 35,
#     'Income.per.dependent': 5, 
#     'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 1500,
#     'Own.home': 1,
#     'Self.employed': 0,
#     'Derogatory.reports': 0
# }
# prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)
# print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation of Nodes:
1. **nodes[0]**: `Derogatory.reports <= 0` checks if the applicant has no derogatory reports.
2. **nodes[1]**: `Income.per.dependent > 4.0` verifies if the income per dependent is greater than 4.0.
3. **nodes[2]**: `Own.home == 1` ensures that the applicant owns a home.
4. **nodes[3]**: `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 2000` checks if the monthly credit card expenses are $2000 or less.

The truth values of these conditions (nodes) guide the flow of the decision tree, culminating in a prediction of either acceptance (`1`) or rejection (`0`) of the credit application.

You can test this function by providing a dictionary with the specified features as shown in the commented "Example usage" section. This will give you the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
