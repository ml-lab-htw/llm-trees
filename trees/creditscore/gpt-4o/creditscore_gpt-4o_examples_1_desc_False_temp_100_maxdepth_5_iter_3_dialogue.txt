Here’s a Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and specifications you've provided. It determines whether an application for credit is accepted (`1`) or not (`0`) and returns the decision along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 7  # Create a list to track nodes. Depth-5 tree has at most 7 inner decisions.

    # Node evaluation (decision rules)
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:
        nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000
        if nodes[3]:
            nodes[4] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
            if nodes[4]:
                nodes[5] = X["Age"] <= 40
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
You can use the function to predict whether a credit application will be accepted, providing a dictionary `X` with the exact feature names and values.

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1,
}

# Get prediction and truth values of nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (credit accepted)
print("Truth values of nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, None, None, True, True, True, None]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Truth values of nodes**: The decision tree has a maximum depth of 5, leading to a maximum of \(2^5-1 = 31\) nodes in a full binary tree. However, not all nodes are used here since the tree structure stops at certain points.

   - The `nodes` list stores the boolean evaluation (`1` for true, `0` for false, and `None` for unused nodes) of each decision node in the tree.
   - Each condition is evaluated in sequence as you descend the tree.

2. **Feature constraints**:
   - `Income.per.dependent`: ≤ 3.5 considered lower, splitting applicants into two major groups.
   - `Derogatory.reports`: > 2 leads directly to rejection.
   - `Own.home`: Owning a home (`1`) positively impacts the decision.
   - `Monthly.credit.card.exp`: ≤ 1000 is a threshold for reasonable spending.
   - `Age`: Applicants <= 40 are considered more likely to be creditworthy if paired with other favorable conditions.
   - `Self.employed`: Being self-employed (`1`) positively impacts the decision.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The final outcome (`prediction`) is `0` (credit not accepted) or `1` (credit accepted) based on the path taken through the tree.

This function implements your requirements while remaining interpretable and in-line with common decision tree structures.
