Here's the Python function implementation of the decision tree classifier to predict whether a credit application is accepted or not. It satisfies the requirements provided, including returning both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes of the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 2.5 if nodes[0] else False
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000 if nodes[1] else False
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] <= 35 if nodes[1] and not nodes[2] else False

    # Decision tree logic to produce the prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # number of derogatory reports <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # income per dependent > 2.5
            if nodes[2]:  # monthly credit card expenses <= 1000
                prediction = 1  # accepted
            else:  # monthly credit card expenses > 1000
                if nodes[3]:  # age <= 35
                    prediction = 0  # rejected
                else:  # age > 35
                    prediction = 1  # accepted
        else:  # income per dependent <= 2.5
            if X["Own.home"] == 1:  # owning a home
                prediction = 1  # accepted
            else:  # not owning a home
                prediction = 0  # rejected
    else:  # number of derogatory reports > 1
        if X["Self.employed"] == 1:  # self-employed
            prediction = 0  # rejected
        else:  # not self-employed
            prediction = 0  # rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The function takes `X`, a dictionary containing the feature values with the exact key names you provided:
   - `"Age"`
   - `"Income.per.dependent"`
   - `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`
   - `"Own.home"`
   - `"Self.employed"`
   - `"Derogatory.reports"`

2. **Nodes**: A list `nodes` is used to store the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks whether the number of derogatory reports is <= 1.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks whether the income per dependent is > 2.5 (if `nodes[0]` is `True`).
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks whether the monthly credit card expenses are <= 1000 (if `nodes[1]` is `True`).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks whether the age is <= 35 (if `nodes[1]` is `True` and `nodes[2]` is `False`).

3. **Tree Logic**: The core logic of the decision tree classifies the credit application as accepted (1) or rejected (0) based on the rules provided earlier.

4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The prediction for whether the application is accepted (1) or not (0).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s how you could use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 3.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 900,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (accepted)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True, False]
```

The decision tree logic matches the specifications provided, with meaningful thresholds and proper feature handling. It evaluates the features progressively to arrive at a decision.
