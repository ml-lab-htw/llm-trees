```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the number of derogatory reports
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check income per dependent if derogatory reports are <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit rejected
    else:
        # Node 1: Check monthly credit card expenses if derogatory reports > 1
        nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1500
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Credit accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list keeps track of which conditions were satisfied (with `True` or `False`).
- **Node 0**: The first condition checks whether the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1.
- **Node 1**: If the applicant has 1 or fewer derogatory reports, the decision is further split based on income per dependent. If the income per dependent is greater than 4.5, the credit is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.
- **Node 1 (Alternative)**: If the applicant has more than 1 derogatory report, the decision is based on monthly credit card expenses. If the expenses are less than or equal to $1500, the credit is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 5.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function can now be used to make predictions based on the provided features and will also return the truth values of the inner nodes.
