Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree for your credit application classification. The function returns a single prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Derogatory.reports > 2
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
        else:  # Derogatory.reports <= 2
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if nodes[2]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
        else:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are feature names (e.g., `"Income.per.dependent"`, `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"`, etc.) that represent the feature values for an individual application.
   
2. **Nodes List**:
   - `nodes` is a list of 3 boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree. `True` means the condition at that node is satisfied, and `False` means it isn't.

3. **Tree Logic**:
   - The first node checks if `"Income.per.dependent" <= 3.5`.
   - The second node checks if `"Derogatory.reports" > 2`.
   - The third node checks if `"Monthly.credit.card.exp" <= 500`.

4. **Predictions (Target)**:
   - When the conditions along the path of the tree are satisfied (or not), the resulting classes (0 = Not Accepted, 1 = Accepted) are returned as predictions.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple `(prediction, nodes)`, where `prediction` is the final class prediction (0 or 1), and `nodes` is a list of truth values for the conditions at each inner node.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X_sample = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Expected output: [False, False, False]
```

### Notes:
- Adjustments to thresholds like `500` for `"Monthly.credit.card.exp"` and `3.5` for `"Income.per.dependent"` were made based on meaningful values given in the instructions.
- Ensure that the feature keys (`"Age"`, `"Income.per.dependent"`, etc.) are used exactly as provided in the input dictionary when using the function.
