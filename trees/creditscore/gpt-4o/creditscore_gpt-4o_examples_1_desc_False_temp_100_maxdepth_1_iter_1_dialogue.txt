Here’s the Python function for the decision tree based on your requested format. It classifies whether an application for credit is accepted (1) or rejected (0), using the provided feature set (`['Age', 'Income.per.dependent', 'Monthly.credit.card.exp', 'Own.home', 'Self.employed', 'Derogatory.reports']`). The decision tree is based on the most informative feature, and I've filled a meaningful threshold for **`Monthly.credit.card.exp`** as `$500`.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts if an application for credit is accepted (1) or denied (0).

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the input feature values. Keys are:
                  ['Age', 'Income.per.dependent', 'Monthly.credit.card.exp', 
                   'Own.home', 'Self.employed', 'Derogatory.reports']
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
               prediction (int): The predicted class (0 = Credit Denied, 1 = Credit Accepted)
               nodes (list): A list of truth values (0 or 1) for evaluated inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize nodes
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the first (and only) node: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500

    # Define the decision based on the node condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Credit Denied
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Credit Accepted

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### How the function works:
The function takes a dictionary `X` as input. The dictionary contains key-value pairs corresponding to the feature names and their respective values. The function evaluates the condition of the decision tree's inner node (`Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500`) and stores the result (truth value) in the `nodes` list. Based on this truth value, the function outputs a binary prediction (`0` for rejection, `1` for acceptance).

### Example usage:
Let’s run a few examples to see how this works.

#### Example 1:
```python
X = {
    'Age': 45,
    'Income.per.dependent': 3.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 300,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 0
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Credit Denied)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1]
```

#### Example 2:
```python
X = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 6.0,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 700,
    'Own.home': 0,
    'Self.employed': 1,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Credit Accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [0]
```

---

### Explanation of Output:
For **Example 1**, `Monthly.credit.card.exp` **is less than or equal to 500**, so the prediction is `0` (Credit Denied), and the corresponding node condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`).

For **Example 2**, `Monthly.credit.card.exp` **is greater than 500**, so the prediction is `1` (Credit Accepted), and the node condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] = 0`).

This function is simple yet flexible, and additional nodes can be easily added to extend the depth of the decision tree in the future!
