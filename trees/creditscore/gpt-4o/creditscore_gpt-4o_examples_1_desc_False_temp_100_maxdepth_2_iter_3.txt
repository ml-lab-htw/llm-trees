Here is a Python function that represents a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using the Features you provided. The decision tree will make a prediction about whether a credit application is accepted (`target = 1`) or not accepted (`target = 0`), based on the most important features.

The decision tree will be designed based on common sense assumptions about the importance of the features. For example, income per dependent and derogatory reports may have an impact on whether a credit application is accepted or not.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Is income per dependent greater than 5.5? 
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.5
    
    # Node 2: If Node 1 is True, check derogatory reports (fewer derogatory reports increase approval chances)
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Approved if income is high and few derogatory reports
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Denied if income is high but many derogatory reports
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Denied if income is low, regardless of derogatory reports

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1** checks if the `Income.per.dependent` is greater than 5.5. If `True`, it means income per dependent is relatively high, which increases the chances of approval.
2. **Node 2** checks if the number of `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1. Fewer derogatory reports typically improve the creditworthiness of an applicant.
3. The decision tree predicts approval (`1`) if both income is high and derogatory reports are low, otherwise it denies the application (`0`).

### Example usage:
```python
# Input feature dictionary 
X_example = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 for accepted, 0 for not accepted
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # [True, True] -> both conditions satisfied
```

In this example, the applicant has an income per dependent greater than 5.5 and no derogatory reports, so the credit application would be accepted (`prediction = 1`).
