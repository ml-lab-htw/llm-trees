Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree for predicting whether an application for credit is accepted or not, based on the given rules. It also provides a list (`nodes`) representing the truth values of the inner conditions at each split in the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the application for credit is accepted (1) or not (0).
    
    Args:
    X (dict): Input dictionary containing the features:
        - 'Age' (int): Age of the applicant in years.
        - 'Income.per.dependent' (float): Income per dependent (1.5 to 10).
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp' (float): Monthly credit card expenses ($).
        - 'Own.home' (int): Whether the applicant owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - 'Self.employed' (int): Whether the applicant is self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no).
        - 'Derogatory.reports' (int): Number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7).

    Returns:
        tuple: Prediction (int) and list of node truth values (list of int). 
    """
    
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Create a list to store the node truth values (5 main splits, plus internal splits).
    
    # Decision Tree Logic
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] > 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
        else:
            nodes[2] = X["Self.employed"] == 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 0
        if nodes[3]:
            nodes[4] = X["Age"] <= 25
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
            else:
                nodes[5] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 250
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
Here is an example of how you can use the `predict` function.

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Age': 30,
    'Income.per.dependent': 5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 300,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}

# Call prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 = Accepted, 0 = Not Accepted
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # List of truth values for each node condition
```

### Explanation

1. **Inputs**:
   - Age: Predictor for applicant's financial maturity.
   - Income.per.dependent: Key splitting feature for deciding eligibility. Lower values indicate financial limitations.
   - Monthly.credit.card.exp: Helps assess spending behavior and financial responsibility.
   - Own.home: Owning a home indicates stability.
   - Self.employed: Self-employment status could indicate income uncertainty.
   - Derogatory.reports: Tracks financial issues like missed payments.

2. **Nodes List**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether `Income.per.dependent <= 4.5`.
   - `nodes[1]`: Whether `Derogatory.reports > 2` for low income.
   - `nodes[2]`: Whether `Self.employed == 1` for low income with low derogatory reports.
   - `nodes[3]`: Whether `Own.home == 0` for high income.
   - `nodes[4]`: Whether `Age <= 25` for applicants with high income but no home ownership.
   - `nodes[5]`: Whether `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 250` for older applicants with high income and no home ownership.
  
This approach ensures that both the prediction and the internal decisions of the decision tree are interpretable.
