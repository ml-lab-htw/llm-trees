Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features you provided, adhering to a maximum depth of 2.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes of the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1 if nodes[0] else X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 2000
    
    # Decision based on the inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **`nodes[0]`** checks whether `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 4.5, which is the first split.
  
- If **`nodes[0]`** is `True` (i.e., income per dependent is less than or equal to 4.5), **`nodes[1]`** checks whether the number of **Derogatory.reports** is less than or equal to 1.
  
- If **`nodes[0]`** is `False` (i.e., income per dependent is greater than 4.5), then **`nodes[1]`** checks whether the **Monthly.credit.card.exp** is less than or equal to 2000.

- Based on the conditions of **`nodes[0]`** and **`nodes[1]`**, the function returns a **prediction** (1 for accepted, 0 for rejected) and the list of **truth values** (`nodes`) representing whether each condition was satisfied.

This structure allows you to trace the decision-making process of the tree through the `nodes` list.
