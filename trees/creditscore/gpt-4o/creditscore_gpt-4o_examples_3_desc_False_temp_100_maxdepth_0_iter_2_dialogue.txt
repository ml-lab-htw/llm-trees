The function `predict` takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the predictive function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [0]  # Initialize the nodes list with `0`s for the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Define the conditions for each node in the tree
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    nodes[3] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 3
    
    # Determine the prediction based on the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'Age': 35,
    'Income.per.dependent': 4.5,
    'Monthly.credit.card.exp': 300,
    'Own.home': 1,
    'Self.employed': 0,
    'Derogatory.reports': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `nodes = 4 * [0]` initializes an array with four elements, all set to `0`. Each element will store the truth value (1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise) for the corresponding inner node in the decision tree.

2. **Inner Node Conditions**:
   - `nodes[0] = X['Derogatory.reports'] <= 1`: Checks if the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1.
   - `nodes[1] = X['Own.home'] == 1`: Checks if the applicant owns a home.
   - `nodes[2] = X['Monthly.credit.card.exp'] <= 500`: Checks if the monthly credit card expenses are less than or equal to $500.
   - `nodes[3] = X['Income.per.dependent'] > 3`: Checks if the income per dependent is greater than 3.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The nested if statements implement the decision tree described earlier. They guide the prediction based on the truth values in the `nodes` array.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - `return prediction, nodes`: Returns the prediction (0 for rejected, 1 for accepted) and the `nodes` array containing the truth values.

### Example Usage:
An example input dictionary `X` is provided, and the function is called with this dictionary. The output will show both the prediction and the inner node truth values.
