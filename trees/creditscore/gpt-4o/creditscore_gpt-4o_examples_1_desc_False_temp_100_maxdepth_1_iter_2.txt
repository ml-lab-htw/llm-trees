Given the Features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1. In this case, I will select the most important feature based on domain intuition and create a decision rule based on that feature.

### Selected Feature:
- **Income.per.dependent**: It is reasonable to assume that income per dependent is a key factor in determining whether a credit application is accepted. Higher income per dependent likely increases the chances of approval.

### Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.0  # Assuming a cutoff value of 4.0 for approval
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Application is accepted
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Application is not accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree checks if the **Income.per.dependent** value is greater than 4.0 (an arbitrarily chosen threshold for this example).
- If the condition is met (i.e. **Income.per.dependent > 4.0**), the application is predicted to be accepted (`prediction = 1`).
- Otherwise, the application is predicted to be rejected (`prediction = 0`).
- The function returns the `prediction` and a list of boolean values indicating whether the condition at the inner node was satisfied (in this case, just one node is present, so the list contains one boolean value).
