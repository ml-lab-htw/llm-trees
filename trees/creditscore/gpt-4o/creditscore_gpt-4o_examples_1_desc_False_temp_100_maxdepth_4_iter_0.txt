Hereâ€™s a decision tree based on the Features you provided with a maximum depth of 4:

### Features:
- **Age**: age (years)
- **Income.per.dependent**: income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: monthly credit card expenses ($)
- **Own.home**: owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Self.employed**: self-employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Derogatory.reports**: number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

### Target Variable:
**target**: application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### Python Function for the Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 5.0
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 500
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 30

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Credit application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Credit application rejected
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Credit application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Credit application rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit application rejected
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Credit application accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Credit application rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Credit application rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: If the "Income per dependent" is greater than 5.0, the path continues to the next node. Otherwise, the applicant is likely rejected.
2. **Node 1**: If the number of derogatory reports is less than or equal to 1, the path continues. Otherwise, the application is rejected.
3. **Node 2**: If the applicant's monthly credit card expenses exceed $500, the path continues. Otherwise, the rejection is likely.
4. **Node 3**: If the applicant is older than 30 years, it increases the chances of getting accepted. Otherwise, it's more likely to be rejected.

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "Age": 35, 
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0, 
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 550, 
    "Own.home": 1, 
    "Self.employed": 0, 
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will print the prediction (whether the credit application is accepted or not) and the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
