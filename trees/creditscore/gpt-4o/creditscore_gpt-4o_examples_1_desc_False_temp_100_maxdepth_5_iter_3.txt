Based on the Features and target variable, I will construct a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 5. The decision tree will evaluate the features in a series of binary conditions, and each decision will lead to either another condition or a final prediction.

### Features:
- **Age**: age (years)
- **Income.per.dependent**: income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
- **Monthly.credit.card.exp**: monthly credit card expenses ($)
- **Own.home**: owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Self.employed**: self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Derogatory.reports**: number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)

### Prediction Target:
- **target**: application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Here is the decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First condition: Check if the applicant has derogatory reports (higher reports may lead to rejection)
    nodes[0] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
    
    # Second condition: Check if the applicant owns a home (owning a home may increase chances of acceptance)
    nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    
    # Third condition: Check if the monthly credit card expenses exceed a certain threshold (higher expenses may indicate financial instability)
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    # Fourth condition: Check if the applicant is self-employed (self-employment may affect creditworthiness)
    nodes[3] = X["Self.employed"] == 0
    
    # Fifth condition: Check income per dependent (higher income per dependent is associated with better creditworthiness)
    nodes[4] = X["Income.per.dependent"] >= 3.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Accepted
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Rejected
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Derogatory.reports ≤ 2**: If the number of derogatory reports is 2 or fewer, we proceed with the next conditions; otherwise, the applicant is rejected.
2. **Own.home == 1**: If the applicant owns a home, they are more likely to be accepted. If not, we check further conditions.
3. **Monthly.credit.card.exp ≤ 500**: Lower monthly credit card expenses (less than $500) are considered favorable. If expenses are too high, the applicant is rejected.
4. **Self.employed == 0**: If the applicant is not self-employed, they are more likely to be accepted. Self-employment may introduce financial instability.
5. **Income.per.dependent ≥ 3.5**: Higher income per dependent is an indicator of better financial capacity, increasing the chances of being accepted for credit.

### Example usage:
```python
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 450,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True, True, True]
```

This decision tree function returns both the prediction (0 = no, 1 = yes) and the truth values for each of the inner nodes, which correspond to the conditions in the decision tree.
