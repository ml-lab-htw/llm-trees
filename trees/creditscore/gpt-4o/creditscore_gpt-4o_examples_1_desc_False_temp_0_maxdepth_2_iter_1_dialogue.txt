Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a prediction (0 = no, 1 = yes) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'Age': age (years)
        - 'Income.per.dependent': income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': monthly credit card expenses ($)
        - 'Own.home': owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Self.employed': self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Derogatory.reports': number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if credit is not accepted, 1 if credit is accepted.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Monthly credit card expenses <= 500
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500
        # Node 1: Income per dependent <= 3.5
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
        else:  # If Income.per.dependent > 3.5
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:  # If Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
        # Node 1: Number of derogatory reports <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # If Derogatory.reports <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # If Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 600,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Node 0** checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 500. This is the root node.
2. If **Node 0** is satisfied (`True`), the function moves to **Node 1**, which checks if `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 3.5.
3. If **Node 0** is not satisfied (`False`), the function moves to a different **Node 1**, which checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1.
4. Based on the conditions of the nodes, the function assigns a prediction of 0 (Not Accepted) or 1 (Accepted).
5. The function also returns a list of truth values (`nodes`) indicating whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.
