Based on your new set of features and the target variable "application for credit is accepted or not", I will design a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 4 and between 4 and 15 inner nodes. Here is the Python function for this decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    # Root node
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 5.5
    # Second level
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Own.home"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 1500
            if nodes[2]:
                nodes[3] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application denied
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application denied
        else:
            nodes[2] = X["Self.employed"] == 1
            if nodes[2]:
                nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 30
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application denied
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application denied
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 2000
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
            if nodes[2]:
                nodes[3] = X["Age"] > 35
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application denied
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application denied
        else:
            nodes[2] = X["Self.employed"] == 1
            prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0  # Application accepted if self-employed, otherwise denied

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Nodes:

1. **Node 0:** The root node checks if the "Income.per.dependent" is less than or equal to 5.5. This is a crucial factor as lower income per dependent might indicate a higher financial burden.
   
2. **Node 1 (left side):** If the income per dependent is â‰¤ 5.5, the next split checks if the individual owns a home (`Own.home == 1`). Owning a home may be an indicator of financial stability.

3. **Node 2 (left-left branch):** If the individual owns a home, the decision checks if their "Monthly.credit.card.exp" is greater than 1500. High expenses on credit cards may indicate financial strain.

4. **Node 3 (left-left-left branch):** If their monthly credit card expenses are high, the model examines if the number of derogatory reports is 2 or fewer. Fewer derogatory reports favor credit acceptance.

5. **Node 2 (left-right branch):** If the individual does not own a home, the model checks if they are self-employed (`Self.employed == 1`). Self-employed individuals may have variable income but still be accepted for credit.

6. **Node 3 (left-right-right branch):** If self-employed, the model checks if the individual is older than 30. Older individuals may have more financial history and stability.

7. **Node 1 (right side):** For higher income per dependent (Income.per.dependent > 5.5), the tree first checks if their "Monthly.credit.card.exp" is under 2000, indicating controlled spending.

8. **Node 2 (right-left branch):** If their credit card expenses are controlled, the model checks if they have 1 or fewer derogatory reports, which increases their chance of acceptance.

9. **Node 3 (right-left-left branch):** If they have few derogatory reports, age > 35 is checked to see if the person has a more established financial history.

10. **Node 2 (right-right branch):** If their expenses are high but they are self-employed, they might still be accepted for credit.

### Example Input and Output:

```python
X = {
    "Age": 40,
    "Income.per.dependent": 6.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1800,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, True, True, True]
```

In this case:
- The "Income.per.dependent" is greater than 5.5, so we move to the right side of the tree.
- The "Monthly.credit.card.exp" is less than 2000, so we continue to check the derogatory reports.
- Since the individual has 1 derogatory report and is over 35, the prediction is that the application will be accepted (1).
