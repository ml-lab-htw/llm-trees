Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a single prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether an application for credit is accepted or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'Age': age (years)
        - 'Income.per.dependent': income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - 'Monthly.credit.card.exp': monthly credit card expenses ($)
        - 'Own.home': owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Self.employed': self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - 'Derogatory.reports': number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if credit is not accepted, 1 if credit is accepted.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Monthly credit card expenses <= 500
    nodes[0] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 500
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Income per dependent <= 3.5
        nodes[1] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
    else:
        # Node 1: Number of derogatory reports <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature (e.g., `"Age"`, `"Income.per.dependent"`, etc.), and the values are the feature values for a specific instance.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry is `1` if the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The root node (Node 0) checks if `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 500.
   - If true, the second node (Node 1) checks if `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 3.5.
   - If false, the second node (Node 1) checks if `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 1.
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = not accepted, 1 = accepted).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 450,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 0]
```

### Thresholds:
- `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 500`: This threshold is chosen to separate applicants with lower credit card expenses from those with higher expenses.
- `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5`: This threshold is chosen to identify applicants with lower income per dependent.
- `Derogatory.reports <= 1`: This threshold is chosen to separate applicants with few or no derogatory reports from those with multiple derogatory reports.

This function implements the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 and provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
