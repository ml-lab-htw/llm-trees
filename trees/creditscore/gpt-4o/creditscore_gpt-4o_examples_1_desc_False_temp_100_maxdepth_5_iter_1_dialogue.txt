Here is the implementation based on the credit application decision tree described earlier. It adheres to your feature names and provides predictions alongside the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a credit application is accepted (1) or rejected (0) based on input features.
    
    Features:
        - Age: age (years)
        - Income.per.dependent: income per dependent (1.5 to 10)
        - Monthly.credit.card.exp: monthly credit card expenses ($)
        - Own.home: owning a home (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - Self.employed: self employed (1 = yes, 0 = no)
        - Derogatory.reports: number of derogatory reports (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7)
    
    Returns:
        - prediction (int): 1 if accepted, 0 if rejected
        - nodes (list): Truth values (1/0) for the inner nodes of the decision tree
    """
    nodes = [None] * 7  # List to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Income.per.dependent <= 6.0
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 6.0
    
    # Node 1: Number of derogatory reports <= 2 (only if Node 0 is True)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 2
        
        # Node 2: Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 300.0 (only if Node 1 is True)
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 300.0
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Rejected
    else:
        # Node 3: Own.home == yes (only if Node 0 is False)
        nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Age <= 35 (only if Node 3 is True)
            nodes[4] = X["Age"] <= 35
            
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:
            # Node 5: Self.employed == yes (only if Node 3 is False)
            nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1
            
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Rejected
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
Suppose you have the following feature values for a new credit application:

```python
X = {
    "Age": 40,
    "Income.per.dependent": 7.5,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 400,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Accepted" if prediction == 1 else "Rejected")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation of the Node Truth Values:
- `nodes[0]`: Checks whether `Income.per.dependent` is less than or equal to 6.0.
- `nodes[1]`: Checks whether `Derogatory.reports` is less than or equal to 2 (if Node 0 is True).
- `nodes[2]`: Checks whether `Monthly.credit.card.exp` is less than or equal to 300.0 (if Node 1 is True).
- `nodes[3]`: Checks whether `Own.home` is 1 (if Node 0 is False).
- `nodes[4]`: Checks whether `Age` is less than or equal to 35 (if Node 3 is True).
- `nodes[5]`: Checks whether `Self.employed` is 1 (if Node 3 is False).

You can debug and test this implementation with different feature values to verify its behavior in a variety of scenarios.
