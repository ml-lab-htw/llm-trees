Hereâ€™s the Python function based on your provided specifications for the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the specified features and returns a prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5
    
    # Node 1: Check if Derogatory.reports <= 1
    nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If Income.per.dependent <= 3.5
        prediction = 0  # Application for credit is not accepted
    else:  # If Income.per.dependent > 3.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If Derogatory.reports <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Application for credit is accepted
        else:  # If Derogatory.reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Application for credit is not accepted

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):**
   - This checks whether the `Income.per.dependent` feature is less than or equal to 3.5. If true, the application is immediately rejected (`prediction = 0`).

2. **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):**
   - This checks whether the `Derogatory.reports` feature is less than or equal to 1. If true, the application is accepted (`prediction = 1`); otherwise, it is rejected (`prediction = 0`).

3. **Truth values of nodes (`nodes` list):**
   - The list `nodes` contains truth values for the conditions at each inner node. For example:
     - `nodes[0] = True` means the condition `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5` is satisfied.
     - `nodes[1] = False` means the condition `Derogatory.reports <= 1` is not satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Age": 30,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.2,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 500,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (accepted)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Key Notes:
- Ensure the input dictionary `X` contains all the specified keys with the correct spelling and case.
- The thresholds (e.g., `3.5` for `Income.per.dependent` and `1` for `Derogatory.reports`) are chosen based on the problem context and assumed importance of features. Adjust them as needed based on actual data and feature importance.
