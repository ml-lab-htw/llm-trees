Here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 5, based on the Features and the target variable, formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree structure
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] > 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] < 35
    nodes[2] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] > 500
    nodes[3] = X["Own.home"] == 1
    nodes[4] = X["Derogatory.reports"] == 0
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Income.per.dependent > 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Age < 35
            if nodes[2]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
                if nodes[3]:  # Own.home == 1
                    if nodes[4]:  # Derogatory.reports == 0
                        prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Application accepted
    else:
        if nodes[2]:  # Monthly.credit.card.exp > 500
            if nodes[3]:  # Own.home == 1
                prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
            else:
                if nodes[4]:  # Derogatory.reports == 0
                    prediction = 1  # Application accepted
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Application not accepted
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Application not accepted

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]** checks if the "Income.per.dependent" is greater than 4.5.
- **nodes[1]** checks if the "Age" is less than 35.
- **nodes[2]** checks if the "Monthly.credit.card.exp" is greater than $500.
- **nodes[3]** checks if the person owns a home (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- **nodes[4]** checks if the number of derogatory reports is 0.

This decision tree structure is designed to make a prediction based on the conditions. The feature importance is reflected in how the features are used in the branching of the tree. The function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for each inner node.
