Below is the Python function `predict` that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a credit application will be accepted (`1`) or not (`0`). This implementation follows the guidelines you provided, with meaningful thresholds, maintaining a maximum depth of 4, returning both the prediction and a list of truth values (`nodes`) for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 7  # Maximum depth = 4, so there are up to 7 decision nodes in a binary tree

    # Decision tree logic with conditions based on feature thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Income.per.dependent"] <= 3.5  # Node 0: Income per dependent threshold
    if nodes[0]:  # If income per dependent is less than or equal to 3.5
        nodes[1] = X["Derogatory.reports"] <= 1  # Node 1: Number of derogatory reports threshold
        if nodes[1]:  # If number of derogatory reports <= 1
            nodes[2] = X["Own.home"] == 1  # Node 2: Owning a home (1 = yes)
            if nodes[2]:  # If owning a home
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Not owning a home
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted
        else:  # If number of derogatory reports > 1
            prediction = 0  # Not accepted
    else:  # If income per dependent > 3.5
        nodes[3] = X["Monthly.credit.card.exp"] <= 1000  # Node 3: Monthly credit card expenses threshold
        if nodes[3]:  # If monthly credit card expenses <= 1000
            nodes[4] = X["Age"] <= 30  # Node 4: Age threshold
            if nodes[4]:  # If age <= 30
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted
            else:  # Age > 30
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
        else:  # If monthly credit card expenses > 1000
            nodes[5] = X["Self.employed"] == 1  # Node 5: Self-employed (1 = yes)
            if nodes[5]:  # If self-employed
                prediction = 1  # Accepted
            else:  # Not self-employed
                prediction = 0  # Not accepted

    # Return the final prediction and the list of inner node truth values
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

1. **Input**: 
   - `X`: A dictionary where keys match the feature names exactly: 
     - `'Age'`
     - `'Income.per.dependent'`
     - `'Monthly.credit.card.exp'`
     - `'Own.home'`
     - `'Self.employed'`
     - `'Derogatory.reports'`

2. **Inner Nodes**:
   - The truth values of conditions at each decision node are stored in the list `nodes`. The length of the list corresponds to the maximum number of inner decision nodes (up to 7 nodes for depth 4).

3. **Tree Splits**:
   - **Node 0**: Splits on `Income.per.dependent` (threshold 3.5).
   - **Node 1**: Checks `Derogatory.reports` (threshold 1) if `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5`.
   - **Node 2**: Checks `Own.home` (1 = yes) if `Income.per.dependent <= 3.5` and `Derogatory.reports <= 1`.
   - **Node 3**: Splits on `Monthly.credit.card.exp` (threshold 1000) if `Income.per.dependent > 3.5`.
   - **Node 4**: Checks `Age` (threshold 30) if `Income.per.dependent > 3.5` and `Monthly.credit.card.exp <= 1000`.
   - **Node 5**: Checks `Self.employed` (1 = yes) if `Income.per.dependent > 3.5` and `Monthly.credit.card.exp > 1000`.

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The final classification result (`1` = accepted, `0` = not accepted).
   - `nodes`: A list of booleans representing whether each inner node's condition is satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input feature values
X = {
    "Age": 35,
    "Income.per.dependent": 4.0,
    "Monthly.credit.card.exp": 1200,
    "Own.home": 1,
    "Self.employed": 0,
    "Derogatory.reports": 0
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 = Accepted, 0 = Not Accepted
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Truth values of inner nodes
```

### Output for Example:

```plaintext
Prediction: 0
Node Truth Values: [False, None, None, False, None, False, None]
```

This output indicates that the application would **not be accepted**, and the truth values of the inner nodes show which conditions were satisfied during the decision path traversal.
