def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: Check if culmen length is less than a threshold
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45  
    
    # Second split (depends on first split): 
    if nodes[0]:
        # If culmen length is short, check flipper length
        nodes[1] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 195  
    else:
        # If culmen length is long, check culmen depth
        nodes[1] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 17  

    # Predictions based on the splits:
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Likely Adelie 
    elif nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 2  # Likely Gentoo
    elif not nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Likely Chinstrap
    else: 
        prediction = 2  # Likely Gentoo 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I've chosen 'culmen_length_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', and 'culmen_depth_mm' as they are likely to be important features for distinguishing penguin species. This is a simplified example - in a real scenario, feature importance would be determined after training a model on data.
2. **Thresholds:**  I've estimated some initial thresholds (45mm for culmen length, 195mm for flipper length, 17mm for culmen depth) based on general knowledge of penguin characteristics. These would need to be refined with real data.
3. **Tree Logic:**
    - The first split checks if the culmen length is short (likely Adelie) or long (likely Chinstrap or Gentoo).
    - The second split further distinguishes based on flipper length (for shorter culmens) or culmen depth (for longer culmens).
4. **Prediction:** The final prediction is made based on which leaf node the input falls into.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:** This is a hypothetical example. To create a more accurate classifier, you'll need to train the decision tree on a labeled dataset of penguin features and species.
* **Feature Engineering:** You might find that combining features or creating new ones (e.g., culmen length-to-depth ratio) improves the model's performance. 
* **Model Evaluation:** After training, you'll need to evaluate the model's accuracy and generalization ability on unseen data.
