def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['island'] == 2  # Torgersen island
    nodes[1] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45  # Threshold based on typical culmen length
    nodes[2] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 17 # Threshold based on typical culmen depth
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 2 # Gentoo
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Chinstrap 
    return prediction, nodes[:2]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` Initialization:** We initialize a list called `nodes` with a size of 3 (maximum possible inner nodes for a depth-2 tree) to store the truth values of our conditions. We keep track of whether each condition is satisfied (1) or not (0).

2. **Root Node (Island):**
   - `nodes[0] = X['island'] == 2` checks if the penguin is from Torgersen Island (island code 2).

3. **Level 2 Nodes:**
   - If `nodes[0]` is True (penguin is from Torgersen), we directly classify it as Gentoo (species code 2).
   - If `nodes[0]` is False, we move to the next level:
     - `nodes[1] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45` checks if the culmen length is less than or equal to 45mm (a reasonable threshold based on general knowledge about penguin species). We choose `culmen_length_mm` as the splitting feature for this node, assuming it is a more discriminative feature than `culmen_depth_mm` in this context.
       - If True, we predict Adelie (species code 0).
       - If False, we predict Chinstrap (species code 1).

4. **Return:** The function returns the predicted species code (0, 1, or 2) and the list `nodes[:2]` containing the truth values for the conditions in the first two nodes. We only return the first two elements of `nodes`, as only those two are relevant for a depth-2 tree in this case.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds (45mm for culmen length and 17mm for culmen depth) are chosen based on general knowledge about penguin species. Without access to data, these are just educated guesses. For optimal performance, you would determine these thresholds from a labeled dataset using a decision tree algorithm.
- **Feature Importance:**  We assume 'island' and 'culmen_length_mm' are the most important features. Data analysis is necessary to confirm this.
- **Tree Depth:**  The depth is fixed at 2. A deeper tree might be more accurate with more data.
