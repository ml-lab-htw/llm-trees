**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:**  The code now directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.
* **Threshold Values:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on the general characteristics of penguin species.  However, these would be optimized during actual training.
* **Boolean to Integer Conversion:** The `nodes` list is now correctly populated with 1s and 0s.
* **Simplified Gentoo Classification:** The body mass check for Gentoo penguins is removed to simplify the example and maintain the depth of 5.  In a real-world scenario, this could lead to misclassifications and should be included (potentially increasing the tree depth or adjusting other thresholds).
* **Example Usage:** I've included example usage to demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the output.


This improved function provides a more accurate representation of how a decision tree would be implemented in practice, while still demonstrating the core concepts. Remember that optimal threshold values and tree structure would be learned from data during training.
