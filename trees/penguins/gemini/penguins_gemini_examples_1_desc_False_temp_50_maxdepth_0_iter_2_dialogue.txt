**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on general penguin characteristics.  For a real application, these thresholds should be learned from data.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list now stores the boolean truth values for each decision node, with `None` for unused nodes in a particular path.
* **Encoding:**  The code uses the provided encoding for island (0, 1, 2) and species (0, 1, 2).
* **Missing Values:** The original hypothetical tree didn't address the possibility of missing values.  In a real-world scenario, you would need to incorporate handling for missing data (e.g., imputation or creating separate branches for unknown values).
* **Tree Complexity:** This is a simplified tree. A decision tree learned from real data might be more complex and have different branching logic.


To create a truly effective model, you should train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn or a similar library using a real penguin dataset. This code provides a functional demonstration of the requested format.
