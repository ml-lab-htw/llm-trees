```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200  # Gentoo usually have longer flippers
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42  # Distinguishes Adelie from Chinstrap
    nodes[2] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen Island mostly Adelie
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 48 # Additional split for Chinstrap/Gentoo edge cases

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[2]:  # Torgersen
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # Biscoe or Dream
            if nodes[1]:  # Shorter culmen
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:  # Longer culmen
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # Longer flippers
        if nodes[3]: # Shorter Culmen
          prediction = 1 # Chinstrap
        else: # Longer culmen
          prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on general knowledge of penguin characteristics.  However, these are just estimates.  Optimal thresholds would be determined by training a decision tree on the actual Palmer Penguins dataset.
* **Island Encoding:**  The provided encoding (0=Biscoe, 1=Dream, 2=Torgersen) is directly used in the function.
* **Simplified Structure:** The hypothetical tree I presented earlier was more complex than necessary.  This version is streamlined while still capturing the key differentiating features.
* **Missing Values:** The function doesn't explicitly handle missing values (NaNs). In a real-world scenario, you'd need to add imputation or other handling for missing data.
* **Sex and Body Mass:**  These features aren't used in this simplified tree.  A more complex tree trained on real data might find them useful, but flipper length and culmen measurements are likely the most dominant features.


**How to Use:**

```python
example_penguin = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2, # male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_penguin)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Output: Node truth values: [True, True, False, True]
```

This function now follows the requested format, providing both the prediction and the truth values for each decision node. Remember that this is a simplified example, and a tree trained on actual data will likely be more complex and perform better.  Use this as a starting point and refine it using a machine learning library with the Palmer Penguins dataset.
