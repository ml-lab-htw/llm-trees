I understand! You need a Python function that represents a decision tree classifier for the penguin species prediction problem, along with a list to track the truth values of the decision nodes. 

**Without specific penguin data to train on and determine the most important features and optimal thresholds, I'll provide a template function and a plausible decision tree structure.  I'll use reasonable assumptions about the features to create meaningful thresholds.**

```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the species of a penguin based on its features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of penguin features.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): The predicted species (0=Adelie, 1=Chinstrap, 2=Gentoo)
            nodes (list): List of truth values for each decision node (1 if True, 0 if False)
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Assuming a depth-2 tree (3 nodes max)

    # Decision Node 1:  Culmen Length
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45 

    # Decision Node 2: Culmen Depth (branch for culmen_length <= 45)
    nodes[1] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 17 

    # Decision Node 3: Flipper Length (branch for culmen_length > 45)
    nodes[2] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 200 

    if nodes[0]:  # Culmen Length <= 45
        if nodes[1]:  # Culmen Depth <= 17 
            prediction = 0  # Likely Adelie
        else:           # Culmen Depth > 17
            prediction = 1  # Likely Chinstrap 
    else:          # Culmen Length > 45
        if nodes[2]:  # Flipper Length <= 200
            prediction = 1  # Likely Chinstrap (some overlap with Adelie possible)
        else:           # Flipper Length > 200
            prediction = 2  # Likely Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict_penguin_species(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the penguin's features. It returns the predicted species (0, 1, or 2) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the decision nodes.

2. **Decision Nodes:** The tree uses culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length. These are likely to be good discriminators between species. 

3. **Thresholds:** I've used estimated thresholds (e.g., culmen length <= 45 mm) based on general knowledge of penguin species.  **You will need to adjust these thresholds with real data and possibly use different features based on feature importance determined during the actual tree building process.**

**To use the function:**

```python
penguin_features = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.5, 
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.0, 
    'flipper_length_mm': 185, 
    'body_mass_g': 3500, 
    'sex': 1  # Female
}

prediction, nodes = predict_penguin_species(penguin_features)

print(f"Predicted Species: {prediction}")
print(f"Decision Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Remember:** This is a template. For accurate predictions, you'll need to:

1. **Train the Decision Tree:** Use a decision tree algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) with labeled penguin data to find the best features, thresholds, and tree structure. 
2. **Evaluate Performance:** Test the trained model on unseen data to assess its accuracy.
