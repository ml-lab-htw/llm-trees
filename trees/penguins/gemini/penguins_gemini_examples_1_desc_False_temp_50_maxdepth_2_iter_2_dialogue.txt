Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer feature usage:** The code now directly uses the specified feature keys.
* **Realistic thresholds:** The `culmen_length_mm` threshold is adjusted to a more plausible value (42mm) based on typical measurements for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.
* **Simplified Gentoo Branch:** Given the depth constraint, I've simplified the Gentoo classification to rely solely on flipper length. A deeper tree could incorporate `island` and other features for more nuanced classification.
* **Example usage:** The code includes example usage demonstrating how to call the `predict` function and interpret the results.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose and arguments.


This revised function provides a more practical and interpretable decision tree for penguin classification within the specified constraints. Remember that a real-world model would benefit from being trained on actual data to determine the optimal thresholds and feature splits.
