**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on the general size differences between penguin species. These are estimates and would need to be refined with real-world data training.
2. **Island Encoding:** The island feature is categorical and encoded as 0, 1, and 2.  The tree now uses `X["island"] == 0` to check specifically for Biscoe Island.
3. **Simplified Structure:** The `if/else` structure is slightly streamlined to directly reflect the decision tree logic.
4. **Feature Usage:** The function uses the specified feature names and encodings.
5. **Return Values:** It returns the predicted species (0, 1, or 2) and the list `nodes` containing boolean values representing the truth value of each decision node.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_penguin = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2,  # Male (not used in this simplified tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_penguin)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") 
```

This example would likely predict Adelie (0) because of the small flipper length and Biscoe Island location.  The `nodes` list would show the truth values of the conditions at each node traversed during the prediction.



This improved function accurately reflects the hypothetical decision tree logic and provides the required output format.  Remember that this is still a hypothetical example.  A real-world application requires data training to get accurate thresholds and feature importance.
