**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**  The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing the features of a single penguin.

2. **Nodes Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each inner node of the decision tree.

3. **Decision Tree Logic (Placeholder):**
   - `nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45`: This line represents the first decision node. It checks if the "culmen_length_mm" is less than or equal to 45 (this is a placeholder threshold - you'll need to determine the actual optimal threshold from your data). If the condition is True, `nodes[0]` is set to 1 (or True), otherwise 0 (or False).
   - `nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195`: This is the second decision node (only evaluated if the first condition was True), checking the "flipper_length_mm" against a placeholder threshold of 195.

4. **Prediction:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree's branches, assigning a prediction (0, 1, or 2) based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.

5. **Return:** The function returns a tuple: `(prediction, nodes)`. 

**Important:**

- **Placeholders:** The thresholds used in the example (45 for `culmen_length_mm` and 195 for `flipper_length_mm`) are **placeholders**. You **must** replace these with meaningful thresholds that you determine from analyzing your penguin dataset and training your decision tree model.
- **Depth 2:** This example demonstrates a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The number of `nodes` and the nested `if-else` structure would change if you needed a different depth.
- **Data Encoding:** The code assumes the data encoding you provided for the features (e.g., island: 0, 1, 2) and the target variable (species: 0, 1, 2). Make sure your input data matches this encoding.
