**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've used approximate thresholds (flipper length 200mm, culmen length 45mm) based on general penguin characteristics.  With real data, you'd optimize these thresholds during training.
* **Island Handling:** The current tree simplifies the island feature. With greater depth or a more complex tree structure, you could incorporate the island information more effectively, potentially using one-hot encoding or other techniques.
* **Data-Driven Approach (Crucial):** Remember, this function is a *simplified representation*.  For a robust and accurate classifier, you *must* train a decision tree model using a labeled penguin dataset and a library like scikit-learn. This code only demonstrates the structure and logic of a decision tree prediction function.  The actual splits and feature importance should be learned from the data.


This improved version adheres to the requested format, provides more realistic thresholds, and includes comments to explain the logic and limitations. Remember to replace the example penguin data with your actual input.  Most importantly, use a proper machine learning library with a real dataset to build a truly effective model.
