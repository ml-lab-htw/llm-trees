```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205  # Threshold based on general Gentoo flipper length
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0 # Adelie/Chinstrap (cannot distinguish further with depth 1)
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Threshold:** The 205mm threshold for flipper length is an educated guess. A real-world application would require training a decision tree on data to determine the optimal threshold that maximizes information gain/minimizes Gini impurity.

2. **Adelie/Chinstrap Ambiguity:**  The major limitation of a depth-1 tree is the inability to fully distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. This could be addressed by increasing the tree depth, which would allow further splits based on other features like culmen length or depth.

3. **Encoded Features:**  The provided code handles the encoded features (island and sex) correctly because the decision tree logic is based on `flipper_length_mm`, which is a numerical feature. If the decision used categorical features, you would need to compare against the encoded values (e.g., `X["island"] == 0` for Biscoe island).

4. **Pythonic List Initialization:** The `nodes = 1 * [None]` is a slightly more Pythonic way to initialize a list of a given size with `None` values.


**Example Usage:**

```python
penguin_data = {
    'island': 0,
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_data)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie/Chinstrap)
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}") # Output: Node conditions: [True]

penguin_data2 = {
    'island': 0,
    'culmen_length_mm': 46.5,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.9,
    'flipper_length_mm': 222,
    'body_mass_g': 4850,
    'sex': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_data2)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 2 (Gentoo)
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}") # Output: Node conditions: [False]
