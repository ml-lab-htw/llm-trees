    else:
        if X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 55:
            prediction = 1 # Chinstrap/Gentoo (ambiguous at depth 2 - choosing Chinstrap as more likely)

This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single penguin's features and returns the predicted species (0, 1, or 2) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the decision nodes.  The decision logic follows the tree structure described previously, using `flipper_length_mm` and `culmen_length_mm` as the splitting features.  Remember that this tree is not trained and based on assumed thresholds.  A real-world application would require training on a dataset to obtain optimal splits.
