```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo (Simplified - a deeper tree would refine this)
    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Threshold:** The `200 mm` threshold for flipper length is a reasonable starting point based on general knowledge of penguin sizes.  A more accurate value would be determined through training a decision tree model on a dataset of penguin measurements.

2. **Simplified Classification (Gentoo/Chinstrap):** Because we are limited to a depth-1 tree, we cannot perfectly separate Gentoo and Chinstrap.  This function prioritizes separating Adelie and defaults to predicting Gentoo when `flipper_length_mm > 200`. In a real-world scenario, you would analyze the distribution of flipper lengths for Gentoo and Chinstrap to choose the class that minimizes the error for `flipper_length > 200` within this simplified model.  Alternatively, if misclassifying Chinstrap as Gentoo is more costly than the reverse, you could adjust the predicted class accordingly.

3. **Data Encoding:** The function assumes the input features are already numerically encoded as described in your prompt (e.g., island as 0, 1, or 2).

4. **Missing Values:**  The function doesn't handle potential missing values (NaNs).  In a real-world application, you should include logic to deal with missing data (e.g., imputation, using a default value, or creating a separate branch in the tree for missing values - though the latter would increase tree depth).



This improved version provides a more robust and practical foundation for a depth-1 decision tree classifier for penguin species. However, remember that a depth-1 tree will have limitations in accuracy. A deeper tree or a different model altogether might be required for more reliable classification.
