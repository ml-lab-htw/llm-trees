**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've filled in reasonable threshold values based on general knowledge of penguin characteristics. However, these are estimates. Optimal thresholds would be learned during training with a real dataset.
* **Island Handling:** I've used the provided encoding (0=Biscoe, 1=Dream, 2=Torgersen) directly in the conditional.
* **Target Encoding:** I've used the specified encoding (0=Adelie, 1=Chinstrap, 2=Gentoo).
* **Clarity:**  The code is structured to closely mirror the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.
* **Efficiency:**  The function evaluates conditions only as needed, avoiding unnecessary computations.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_penguin = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2 # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_penguin)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")
```


This improved function provides a more accurate and robust implementation of the decision tree logic for penguin species prediction. Remember that the effectiveness of this function relies heavily on the accuracy of the chosen thresholds, which ideally would be learned from a real dataset.
