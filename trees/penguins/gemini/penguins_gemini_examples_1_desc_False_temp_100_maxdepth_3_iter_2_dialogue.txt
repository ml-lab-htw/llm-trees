Key improvements:

* **Clearer Structure:**  The `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  Reasonable threshold values (190mm for flipper length, 42mm for culmen length, 17mm for culmen depth) are used. These are based on the general size differences between penguin species but would need to be refined with real data.
* **Handles Ambiguity:** The ambiguous case is now explicitly addressed. We simplified it to predict Chinstrap, but ideally, a more complex tree would be necessary to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap in the overlapping region.
* **Returns Node Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list now stores boolean values indicating which branches were taken.
* **Example Usage:** Included example usage to demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the results.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.


This revised function is much closer to a practical implementation of a decision tree classifier. Remember that to build a truly effective classifier, you would need to train it on real data using a machine learning library like scikit-learn. This example provides a basic framework for understanding how a simple decision tree works.
