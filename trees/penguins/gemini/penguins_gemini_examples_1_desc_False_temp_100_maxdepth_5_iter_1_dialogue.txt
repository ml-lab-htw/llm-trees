**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:** The code now uses the correct encoding for `island` (0=Biscoe, 1=Dream, 2=Torgersen) and `species` (0=Adelie, 1=Chinstrap, 2=Gentoo).
* **Threshold Values:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on general penguin characteristics.  However, these are just estimates.  Optimal thresholds would come from training a real decision tree on data.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The nested `if/else` structure is more directly aligned with the decision tree logic, making it easier to read and understand.
* **List Comprehension:** The `nodes` list is now created using a list comprehension for conciseness and efficient conversion of boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False).
* **Handling Missing Values:** While the provided encoding includes a "nan" value for sex, the current tree doesn't use the `sex` feature. If you intend to use it, you would need to decide how to handle missing values (imputation, creating a separate branch for nan, etc.)  This would depend on your data and analysis goals.





This revised function directly mirrors the decision tree logic and uses the specified encodings. Remember,  this is still a hypothetical tree.  With real data, you would train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` using scikit-learn for the best results.  You could then extract the structure and thresholds from the trained model to create a similar prediction function.
