**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on general knowledge of penguin sizes and the hypothetical decision tree from the previous response. These would be refined with real data.

* **Island Encoding:** The code uses the provided encoding (0=Biscoe, 1=Dream, 2=Torgersen) directly.

* **Handling Edge Cases:** The code now handles cases where a penguin with a short flipper has an unexpectedly long culmen (though unlikely).

* **Simplified Logic:** The code structure is slightly simplified by directly using the `culmen_length_mm` value in the `else` block for `flipper_length_mm > 200`.


**How to Use:**

You can call the `predict` function with a dictionary containing the penguin's features:


```python
penguin_features = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2 # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}") # Output: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Output: Node truth values: [True, True, None, False]


```



This improved version provides a more functional decision tree classifier with defined thresholds and handles feature encodings, returning both the prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values derived from actual data analysis for a more accurate model.  Using a machine learning library like scikit-learn would provide the best results.
