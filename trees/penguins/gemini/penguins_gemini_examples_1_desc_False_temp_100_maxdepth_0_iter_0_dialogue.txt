```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        if X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 50:
            prediction = 1 # Chinstrap/Gentoo (Ambiguous, leaning towards Chinstrap given the lower culmen length)
        else:
            prediction = 2 # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function adheres to the requested format and uses the specified feature names and target variable encoding.  Remember, the threshold values are educated guesses in the absence of training data, and the ambiguity for Chinstrap/Gentoo with larger flippers is acknowledged.  With a real dataset, a trained decision tree would have more precise split points and potentially address this overlap more effectively.
