def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 44.0 
    nodes[1] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 18.0
    nodes[2] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 198.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Likely Chinstrap
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Likely Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Feature Selection:** Based on general knowledge about penguins, I've chosen 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', and 'flipper_length_mm' as potentially important features for distinguishing species.
* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (44.0, 18.0, 198.0) are placeholders.  To determine more accurate thresholds, you would need to analyze the distribution of these features for each penguin species in your dataset. 
* **Decision Logic:** The tree follows a nested structure to classify penguins:
    - **Node 0 (Root):** If 'culmen_length_mm' is less than or equal to 44.0 mm, it's more likely to be Adelie or Chinstrap. Otherwise, it's more likely to be Gentoo.
    - **Node 1:** If 'culmen_depth_mm' is less than or equal to 18.0 mm, it's more likely to be Adelie. Otherwise, it's more likely to be Chinstrap.
    - **Node 2:** If 'flipper_length_mm' is less than or equal to 198.0 mm, it's more likely to be Chinstrap. Otherwise, it's more likely to be Gentoo.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:** This decision tree is based on assumptions and needs to be trained with your actual penguin dataset to get accurate thresholds and improve prediction accuracy.
* **Feature Engineering:**  You can explore additional features or combinations of features that might improve the classifier's performance.
* **Model Evaluation:**  After training the tree with real data, evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on a separate test dataset.
