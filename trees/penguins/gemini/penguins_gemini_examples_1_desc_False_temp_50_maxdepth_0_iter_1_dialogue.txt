**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've filled in reasonable threshold values based on general penguin characteristics.  These are illustrative and would be optimized in a real-world scenario using data.
* **Island Encoding:** The code directly uses the numerical encoding for the island (0, 1, 2).
* **Nested `if/else`:**  The code uses nested `if/else` statements to mimic the decision tree's branching logic.
* **Boolean List:** The function returns a list of booleans (converted to integers: 1 for True, 0 for False) representing the path taken through the decision tree. This gives insight into which decisions were made during the prediction process.
* **Handling Edge Cases**: The 'else' clause at the end is technically redundant, as the Island should be either 0,1 or 2. However, it is added for completeness in case invalid inputs are given.



**Example Usage:**

```python
example_penguin = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 42,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18,
    'flipper_length_mm': 190,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2 # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_penguin)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Decision path: {nodes}")  # Output: Decision path: [1, 1, 1, 0, None, None, 0]
```

This improved version is more functional, uses appropriate thresholds (though illustrative), handles island encoding, and provides a more detailed output for understanding the decision process.  Remember that using a real dataset and training a `DecisionTreeClassifier` with `scikit-learn` is the best way to build a robust and accurate penguin species classifier.
