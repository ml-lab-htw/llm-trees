    Predicts the penguin species based on input features.

    Args:

            - 'culmen_length_mm': Culmen length (mm)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): Predicted penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)

```

**Explanation:**

* **Function Structure:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the penguin features and returns the predicted species and the truth values of the decision nodes.
* **Placeholders:**  I've used placeholder thresholds for `culmen_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm`. You'll need to determine the most appropriate thresholds based on your data analysis.
* **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree logic. For example, if `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45, and `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 195, the model predicts Adelie (species 0).

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:** You need to analyze your penguin dataset to determine the most discriminating features and the appropriate thresholds for the decision nodes.
* **Feature Importance:** Consider using feature importance techniques (like those from decision tree algorithms) to select the best features for your depth-2 tree.
* **Threshold Optimization:**  You might need to experiment with different thresholds to find the values that give the best classification performance on your data.

Remember, this is a basic example to illustrate the structure. You'll need to adapt the features, thresholds, and potentially the tree structure itself based on the patterns you find in your penguin data.
