**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` list:** This list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. A `True` value means the condition is met, leading to the left branch, while `False` means taking the right branch. 

2. **Feature Selection & Thresholds:**
   - **Node 1 (Root):** We hypothesize that "island" is a strong predictor, and penguins on Biscoe Island are highly likely to be Adelie. So, the first condition checks if `island == 0` (Biscoe).
   - **Node 2:** If on Biscoe (Node 1 is True), we further check `culmen_length_mm`. A threshold of 45.0 mm is a reasonable guess to differentiate Adelie from Chinstrap (based on general knowledge, real-world data would refine this).
   - **Node 3:** If not on Biscoe (Node 1 is False), we look at `culmen_depth_mm`.  A threshold of 18.0 mm is another educated guess to help distinguish Chinstrap from Gentoo.

3. **Prediction:** The final `if-else` block uses the `nodes` values to traverse the tree and arrive at a prediction based on the decision path.

**Important Notes:**

- **Data Required:** This decision tree is based on assumptions and general knowledge. To create a more accurate classifier, you **must** train a decision tree algorithm on real penguin data to find the most significant features and optimal threshold values.
- **Complexity:** A depth-2 tree might be too simple for this problem. Real-world applications often involve more complex trees for better accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Once you have a trained tree, it's crucial to evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and potentially visualize the tree to understand its decision boundaries.
