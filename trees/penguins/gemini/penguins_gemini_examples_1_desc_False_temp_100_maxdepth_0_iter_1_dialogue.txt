```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Reasonable threshold based on general Gentoo culmen length
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 48  

    # Reasonable thresholds based on general culmen depth differences
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 16


    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Chinstrap/Adelie (More likely Chinstrap with this threshold)
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            
    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:** I've chosen approximate threshold values (48mm for culmen length, 16mm for culmen depth) based on general knowledge of penguin species.  These are just estimates and would need refinement with real data.
* **Depth 2:** The function strictly adheres to the depth 2 limitation.
* **Feature Encoding:** The function uses the feature names exactly as provided. It assumes the numerical representation of the categorical features 'island' and 'sex'  are already handled appropriately in the input dictionary `X`.
* **No Training:**  As requested, this function doesn't involve any training. The thresholds are hand-picked placeholders.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (True/False, which are equivalent to 1/0 in Python's boolean context) of the conditions at each inner node. This allows for easy interpretation of the decision path taken.

This function provides a basic decision tree structure for penguin classification. To build a more accurate model, you would need to train it on a real dataset using machine learning techniques. This would determine the optimal thresholds and potentially incorporate other features for better performance.
