**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on general knowledge of penguin characteristics.  These values would be learned from data in a real-world scenario.
* **Island Encoding:** The provided prompt specifies island encoding (0=Biscoe, 1=Dream, 2=Torgersen). The code uses this encoding directly.
* **Species Encoding:** The species are encoded as 0 (Adelie), 1 (Chinstrap), and 2 (Gentoo).  The code reflects this.
* **Clarity:**  The code is structured to follow the logic of the decision tree closely, making it easier to understand and debug.
* **Missing Values:**  In real-world data, you might have missing values.  You would need to handle these appropriately (e.g., imputation, separate branch in the tree). This code doesn't handle missing values explicitly.
* **Sex:**  In this hypothetical tree, I haven't used the 'sex' feature. A real decision tree trained on data might reveal if this feature is relevant.
* **Body Mass:**  Similar to 'sex', I haven't included 'body_mass_g' in this simplified tree. A trained model might find it useful.

This improved function provides a clear implementation of the decision tree logic and uses the specified feature and target encodings.  Remember, the accuracy and effectiveness of this tree depend on the quality and characteristics of the real-world data used to train a true decision tree model.
