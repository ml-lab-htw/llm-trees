def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45 
    nodes[1] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 198
    nodes[2] = X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 17

    if nodes[0]:  
        if nodes[1]: 
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

* **Feature Selection:** Based on general knowledge about penguins, I've chosen `culmen_length_mm` and `flipper_length_mm` as the primary splitting features. These features tend to differ significantly between species.  Culmen depth is used as a secondary discriminator.
* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (45mm for culmen length, 198mm for flipper length, 17mm for culmen depth) are approximations based on typical values for the species.  Ideally, these thresholds would be determined by analyzing a dataset of penguin measurements.
* **Depth and Structure:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2 to meet your requirement.  It first splits based on culmen length, then on flipper length or culmen depth depending on the first split.

**Important Note:** This decision tree is based on general assumptions and may not be very accurate. To create a robust decision tree, you would need to train it on a real dataset using a decision tree learning algorithm.
