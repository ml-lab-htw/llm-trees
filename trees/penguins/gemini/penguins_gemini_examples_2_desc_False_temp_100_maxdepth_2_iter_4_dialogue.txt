I can certainly help you with that. Since you haven't provided a dataset for training, I'll create a plausible decision tree based on general knowledge about penguins.  

**Assumptions:**

* **Culmen Length and Species:**  Gentoo penguins tend to have longer culmens than Chinstrap or Adelie penguins.
* **Island and Species:** Different species have different distributions across islands.

Let's represent this logic in a decision tree with a depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45  # Threshold separating Gentoo (longer)
    nodes[1] = X["island"] == 0  # Biscoe Island (assuming more Adelie)

    if nodes[0]:  # Culmen length shorter
        if nodes[1]:  # Biscoe Island
            prediction = 0  # Likely Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Likely Chinstrap
    else:  # Culmen length longer
        prediction = 2  # Likely Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Node 0:** Checks if `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45mm.  This is our first split, aiming to separate Gentoo penguins. 
2. **Node 1:** If `culmen_length_mm` is short (<= 45mm), we then check if the penguin is from Biscoe Island (`island` == 0). We're assuming a higher prevalence of Adelie penguins on Biscoe. 
3. **Predictions:**
    * **Short culmen, Biscoe Island:** Likely Adelie (prediction = 0)
    * **Short culmen, Not Biscoe Island:** Likely Chinstrap (prediction = 1)
    * **Long culmen:**  Likely Gentoo (prediction = 2)

**Important Notes:**

* **Without real data, this tree is very likely inaccurate!** The thresholds and even feature choices might be completely wrong.
* **Data-driven approach:** To get a truly useful decision tree, you would need to provide a dataset and train the model on that data. 

I hope this example demonstrates how to structure the Python function. Once you provide data, I can help you build a more accurate decision tree!
