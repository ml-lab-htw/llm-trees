**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:** The code now correctly uses the provided feature encodings (0, 1, 2 for island, etc.).
* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on general knowledge of penguin characteristics.  For example, a culmen length of 45mm is a reasonable separator for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.  Flipper length around 210mm helps distinguish Gentoo.  These thresholds would be more precise if determined from a real dataset.
* **Simplified Structure:** The `if/elif/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to read and follow.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list accurately tracks the truth values of each decision in the tree.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hinting for clarity (although the `# type: ignore` is still necessary due to the dynamic nature of the list creation, a more robust solution would involve pre-allocating the list or using a different data structure).


**Example Usage:**

```python
penguin_features = {
    "island": 0,  # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 42,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 19,
    "flipper_length_mm": 195,
    "body_mass_g": 3750,
    "sex": 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")      # Output: Node truth values: [True, True, True, False]


penguin_features_2 = {
    "island": 0,  # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 48,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 19,
    "flipper_length_mm": 220,
    "body_mass_g": 5000,
    "sex": 2,
}


prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features_2)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}") # Output: Predicted species: 2 (Gentoo)

```


This improved function provides both a prediction and the inner node truth values as requested, and it's structured to accurately represent the hypothetical decision tree logic while adhering to the specified feature encodings.  Remember, though, that a true decision tree would need to be trained on real data for accurate predictions.
