This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single penguin's features and returns the predicted species (0, 1, or 2) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the decision nodes.  The thresholds (200mm for flipper length and 45mm for culmen length) are approximations based on general penguin characteristics, as we don't have training data here.  In a real application, you would train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` to learn these thresholds from data.
