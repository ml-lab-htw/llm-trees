Sure! Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a penguin and returns the predicted species along with a list of truth values representing the conditions at each node in the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 5  # Initialize a list of 5 elements for the nodes
    
    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = int(X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1
        nodes[1] = int(X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.5)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Prediction: Adelie (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Prediction: Chinstrap (1)
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # Prediction: Gentoo (2)
        prediction = 2
    
    # Nodes 2 to 4 are not used in this tree but included for consistency
    nodes[2] = 0
    nodes[3] = 0
    nodes[4] = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- We initialize a list `nodes` with 5 elements, as per your request for a maximum depth of 5. Even though our tree only needs 2 nodes, we include 5 for consistency.
  
- **Node 0:** Checks if the flipper length is less than or equal to 206.5 mm.
  
  ```python
  nodes[0] = int(X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5)
  ```

  - **If True (1):** Proceed to **Node 1**.
  - **If False (0):** Predict **Gentoo** (species `2`).
  
- **Node 1:** Checks if the culmen length is less than or equal to 42.5 mm.
  
  ```python
  nodes[1] = int(X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.5)
  ```

  - **If True (1):** Predict **Adelie** (species `0`).
  - **If False (0):** Predict **Chinstrap** (species `1`).

- **Nodes 2 to 4:** These nodes are not used in this decision tree but are set to `0` to maintain the structure of the `nodes` list.

- **Return Value:**
  
  - `prediction`: The predicted species (`0` for Adelie, `1` for Chinstrap, `2` for Gentoo).
  - `nodes`: A list containing `1` or `0` representing whether each condition is satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input
penguin_features = {
    'island': 0,               # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 40.0,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 195.0,
    'body_mass_g': 3650,
    'sex': 1                   # Female
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)

print("Predicted species:", prediction)
print("Decision path:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted species: 0
Decision path: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- **Node 0:** `flipper_length_mm` (195.0) ≤ 206.5 → **True** (`1`).
- **Node 1:** `culmen_length_mm` (40.0) ≤ 42.5 → **True** (`1`).
- **Prediction:** Species `0` (Adelie).

**Notes:**

- Make sure to input the features with the exact keys and data types as specified.
- The `nodes` list can help trace the path taken in the tree for debugging or analysis purposes.
- If any of the features are missing or have unexpected values, the function may not work as intended.

**Feature Key Reference:**

- `'island'`: (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen)
- `'culmen_length_mm'`: Length of the culmen in millimeters.
- `'culmen_depth_mm'`: Depth of the culmen in millimeters.
- `'flipper_length_mm'`: Length of the flipper in millimeters.
- `'body_mass_g'`: Body mass in grams.
- `'sex'`: (0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `species`: (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)

Feel free to adjust the thresholds or expand the tree if you have additional data that suggests more detailed splits are necessary. However, based on the most significant features and aiming for simplicity and accuracy, the above decision tree should perform well in classifying penguin species.
