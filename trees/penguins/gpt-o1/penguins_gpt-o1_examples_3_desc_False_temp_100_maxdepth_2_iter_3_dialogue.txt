```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = int(X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5)
    nodes[1] = int(X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2      # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Features Used:**
  - `flipper_length_mm`
  - `culmen_length_mm`

- **Inner Nodes (`nodes` list):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Result of `X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5`
  - `nodes[1]`: Result of `X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `1`)

- **Prediction Encoding:**
  - `0`: Adelie
  - `1`: Chinstrap
  - `2`: Gentoo

### Usage Example:

Suppose we have a penguin with the following measurements:

```python
penguin_features = {
    "island": 1,              # Dream
    "culmen_length_mm": 39.1,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18.7,
    "flipper_length_mm": 181.0,
    "body_mass_g": 3750,
    "sex": 1                  # Female
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)
print("Predicted Species:", prediction)
print("Inner Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Species: 0
Inner Nodes Truth Values: [1, 1]
```

This means the penguin is predicted to be **Adelie**, and both conditions in the inner nodes are satisfied.

### Notes:

- **Thresholds:** The thresholds `206.5` mm for flipper length and `45.0` mm for culmen length are meaningful values derived from the dataset to best split the species.
- **Feature Names:** The feature keys used in the function match exactly the ones you've provided.
- **Nodes List:**
  - The entries are converted to `int` to ensure they are `1` (if condition is `True`) or `0` (if condition is `False`), as per your requirement.

### Reminder of Feature Encodings:

- **island:**
  - `0` = Biscoe
  - `1` = Dream
  - `2` = Torgersen
- **sex:**
  - `0` = nan
  - `1` = female
  - `2` = male
- **species (prediction output):**
  - `0` = Adelie
  - `1` = Chinstrap
  - `2` = Gentoo
