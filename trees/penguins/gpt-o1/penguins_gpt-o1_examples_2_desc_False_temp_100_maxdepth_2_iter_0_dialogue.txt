Certainly! Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree you provided. It returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the `nodes` list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        nodes[1] = int(X["body_mass_g"] <= 4500)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a list `nodes` with `None` values to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Since the tree depth is 2, there are 2 inner nodes.

2. **First Inner Node (`nodes[0]`):**
   - **Condition:** `X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5`
   - We evaluate the condition using the input features and store the result as an integer (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`).
   - **Interpretation:**
     - If the flipper length is less than or equal to 206.5 mm, the penguin is likely an **Adelie** species.
     - We set `prediction = 0` (Adelie) and do not need to evaluate further conditions.

3. **Second Inner Node (`nodes[1]`):**
   - If the first condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] == 0`), we proceed to evaluate the second condition.
   - **Condition:** `X["body_mass_g"] <= 4500`
   - Again, we store the result as an integer in `nodes[1]`.
   - **Interpretation:**
     - If the body mass is less than or equal to 4500 g, the penguin is classified as **Chinstrap** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Otherwise, it's classified as **Gentoo** (`prediction = 2`).

4. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns the `prediction` (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function with a sample input:

```python
# Sample input feature set
X_sample = {
    'island': 1,                # Dream (Not used in this tree)
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,   # Not used in this tree
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,    # Not used in this tree
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,   # Flipper length in mm
    'body_mass_g': 3750,        # Body mass in grams
    'sex': 1                    # Female (Not used in this tree)
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

# Output
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")
print(f"Inner node truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Note on Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact feature keys as specified:
  - `'island'`
  - `'culmen_length_mm'`
  - `'culmen_depth_mm'`
  - `'flipper_length_mm'`
  - `'body_mass_g'`
  - `'sex'`
- The target variable encoding for `species` is:
  - `0` = Adelie
  - `1` = Chinstrap
  - `2` = Gentoo
- The feature encodings are as specified in your description, so make sure to encode categorical features (like `'island'` and `'sex'`) correctly if you use them in an extended version of the tree.

**Final Remarks:**

This function closely follows the structure of your decision tree and adheres to the formatting guidelines provided. It uses the most important features (`flipper_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`) to make predictions within a maximum depth of 2.
