Sure! Based on the decision tree we constructed earlier and following the format of your examples, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**

  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision node at depth 1:
    - Checks if `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to **206.0 mm**.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision node at depth 2:
    - Checks if `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to **42.0 mm**.
  
- **Prediction Mapping:**

  - **0**: Adelie
  - **1**: Chinstrap
  - **2**: Gentoo

**Usage Example:**

Suppose you have a penguin with the following features:

```python
X = {
    'island': 0,                # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181.0,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2                    # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```

**Interpretation:**

- The penguin's flipper length is **181.0 mm**, which is **<= 206.0 mm**, so `nodes[0]` is **True**.
- The penguin's culmen length is **39.1 mm**, which is **<= 42.0 mm**, so `nodes[1]` is **True**.
- Following the tree:
  - Since `nodes[0]` is **True**, we move to the left subtree.
    - Since `nodes[1]` is **True**, the prediction is **0** (**Adelie**).

**Note on Thresholds:**

- The thresholds (**206.0 mm** for flipper length and **42.0 mm** for culmen length) are chosen based on meaningful splits that best separate the penguin species according to their physical measurements.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Feature Keys:**

  - `'island'`
  - `'culmen_length_mm'`
  - `'culmen_depth_mm'`
  - `'flipper_length_mm'`
  - `'body_mass_g'`
  - `'sex'`

- **Target Variable Encoding (`species`):**

  - **0**: Adelie
  - **1**: Chinstrap
  - **2**: Gentoo

**Remember:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with the exact keys and that categorical features are encoded as specified.
