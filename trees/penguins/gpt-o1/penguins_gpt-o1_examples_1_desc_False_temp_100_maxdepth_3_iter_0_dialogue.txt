Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree you requested. It returns a single prediction for the penguin species (encoded as 0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and a list representing the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0, 0]  # Initialize a list of three nodes
    # Node 0: flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
    nodes[0] = int(X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 205.0)
    # Node 1: culmen_depth_mm <= 17.0 (only evaluated if Node 0 is True)
    nodes[1] = int(X['culmen_depth_mm'] <= 17.0) if nodes[0] else 0
    # Node 2: Not used in this tree, set to 0
    nodes[2] = 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `'flipper_length_mm'`
  - `'culmen_depth_mm'`

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `flipper_length_mm <= 205.0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `culmen_depth_mm <= 17.0`. This is only relevant if `nodes[0]` is `1` (True).
  - `nodes[2]`: Unused in this tree (since the maximum depth is 3 and we have no further splits), so it is set to `0`.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (i.e., `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 205.0):
    - Check `nodes[1]`:
      - If `nodes[1]` is `1` (i.e., `culmen_depth_mm` is less than or equal to 17.0), the prediction is `1` (Chinstrap).
      - Else, the prediction is `0` (Adelie).
  - Else (i.e., `flipper_length_mm` is greater than 205.0), the prediction is `2` (Gentoo).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function with a sample input:

```python
# Sample input dictionary
sample_penguin = {
    'island': 0,              # Biscoe (not used in prediction)
    'culmen_length_mm': 45.0, # Example value
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.5,  # Example value
    'flipper_length_mm': 210, # Example value
    'body_mass_g': 5000,      # Example value (not used in prediction)
    'sex': 1                  # Female (not used in prediction)
}

# Make prediction
species_prediction, nodes_truth_values = predict(sample_penguin)

# Output the prediction and nodes
print("Predicted Species Code:", species_prediction)
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes_truth_values)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Predicted Species Code: 2
Nodes Truth Values: [0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- The `flipper_length_mm` is `210`, so `nodes[0]` is `0` (since `210 > 205.0`).
- Since `nodes[0]` is `0`, `nodes[1]` is set to `0` and not evaluated.
- The prediction is `2`, corresponding to **Gentoo**.

**Note on Thresholds:**

- The threshold values (`205.0` for `flipper_length_mm` and `17.0` for `culmen_depth_mm`) are meaningful values determined based on the data distribution and are critical for differentiating between the penguin species.

**Mapping of Species Encoding:**

- `0`: Adelie
- `1`: Chinstrap
- `2`: Gentoo
