Certainly! Below is the Python function representing the decision tree classifier you've described. The function `predict` accepts a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a single prediction for the penguin species along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The truth values are `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied and `0` if not.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Total of 2 inner nodes
    # Node 0: flipper_length_mm <= 206.5
    nodes[0] = int(X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: culmen_depth_mm <= 17.0
        nodes[1] = int(X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node not evaluated
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"flipper_length_mm"`: Flipper length in millimeters.
  - `"culmen_depth_mm"`: Culmen depth in millimeters.

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  1. **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to `206.5`.
     - If **Yes (`1`)**, proceeds to Node 1.
     - If **No (`0`)**, predicts **Gentoo (`2`)**.
  2. **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if `culmen_depth_mm` is less than or equal to `17.0`.
     - If **Yes (`1`)**, predicts **Chinstrap (`1`)**.
     - If **No (`0`)**, predicts **Adelie (`0`)**.

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - Each element corresponds to an inner node:
    - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
    - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
    - `None` if the node is not evaluated.
  - In this tree:
    - `nodes[0]`: Result of the first condition (`flipper_length_mm <= 206.5`).
    - `nodes[1]`: Result of the second condition (`culmen_depth_mm <= 17.0`) evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `1`.
  
- **Species Encoding:**
  - `0`: Adelie
  - `1`: Chinstrap
  - `2`: Gentoo

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    'island': 1,                # Dream (not used in this tree)
    'culmen_length_mm': 45.1,   # Example value
    'culmen_depth_mm': 14.5,    # Example value
    'flipper_length_mm': 210.0, # Example value
    'body_mass_g': 4500,        # Example value (not used in this tree)
    'sex': 2                    # Male (not used in this tree)
}

# Predicting the species
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output
print(f"Predicted Species: {prediction}")  # Expected output: 2 (Gentoo)
print(f"Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")  # Expected output: [0, None]
```

**Notes:**

- The thresholds `206.5` for `flipper_length_mm` and `17.0` for `culmen_depth_mm` are chosen based on meaningful values that help in distinguishing between the penguin species in the dataset.
- Only the most significant features are used to keep the tree depth at a maximum of 2, as specified.
- Unused features (`'island'`, `'culmen_length_mm'`, `'body_mass_g'`, and `'sex'`) are present in the feature dictionary but are not utilized in this decision tree.

**Summary:**

This function implements a decision tree classifier that predicts the penguin species based on two key features: flipper length and culmen depth. It returns both the prediction and a list of truth values indicating which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process.
