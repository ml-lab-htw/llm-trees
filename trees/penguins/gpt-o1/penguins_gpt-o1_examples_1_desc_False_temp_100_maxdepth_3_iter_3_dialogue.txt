Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for penguin species based on the provided features. The function returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the list is `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0)
    nodes[1] = int(X["island"] == 1)  # 1 corresponds to 'Dream' Island
    nodes[2] = int(X["culmen_length_mm"] > 43.5)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `"island"`: Encoded as `0` = Biscoe, `1` = Dream, `2` = Torgersen
  - `"culmen_length_mm"`: Numeric value representing the culmen length in millimeters.
  - `"flipper_length_mm"`: Numeric value representing the flipper length in millimeters.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: Adelie
  - `1`: Chinstrap
  - `2`: Gentoo

- **Inner Nodes Conditions:**
  1. **Node 0:** `flipper_length_mm <= 206.0`
     - **Purpose:** Distinguish Gentoo penguins (longer flippers) from others.
  2. **Node 1:** `island == 1` (Dream Island)
     - **Purpose:** Identify Chinstrap penguins found on Dream Island.
  3. **Node 2:** `culmen_length_mm > 43.5`
     - **Purpose:** Differentiate between Chinstrap and Adelie penguins based on culmen length.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input dictionary:
penguin_features = {
    'island': 1,              # Dream Island
    'culmen_length_mm': 50.0,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 200.0,
    'body_mass_g': 3800,
    'sex': 2                   # Male
}

# Make a prediction:
prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)
print("Predicted Species:", prediction)
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Species: 1
Nodes Truth Values: [1, 1, 1]
```

- **Predicted Species:** `1` corresponds to **Chinstrap** penguin.
- **Nodes Truth Values:** `[1, 1, 1]` indicates that all conditions up to the prediction were satisfied.

**Notes:**

- The function strictly uses the exact keys of the features as provided.
- All thresholds are filled with meaningful values derived from the decision tree.
- The function can be used to predict the species of a penguin given its features according to the decision tree classifier.

**Remember:** Ensure that the values provided in `X` match the expected encoding for categorical features (`'island'` and `'sex'`). Numerical features should be provided as floats or integers representing measurements in millimeters or grams as specified.
