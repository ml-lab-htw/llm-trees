Sure! Based on the provided decision tree and feature encodings, here is the Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if island == Torgersen (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['island'] == 2 else 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If island is Torgersen, predict Adelie (encoded as 0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if island == Biscoe (encoded as 0)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['island'] == 0 else 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if flipper_length_mm >= 210.0
            nodes[2] = 1 if X['flipper_length_mm'] >= 210.0 else 0
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # If flipper_length_mm >= 210.0, predict Gentoo (encoded as 2)
                prediction = 2
            else:
                # If flipper_length_mm < 210.0, predict Adelie (encoded as 0)
                prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 3: Check if culmen_depth_mm < 17.0
            nodes[3] = 1 if X['culmen_depth_mm'] < 17.0 else 0
            
            if nodes[3]:
                # If culmen_depth_mm < 17.0, predict Chinstrap (encoded as 1)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If culmen_depth_mm >= 17.0, predict Adelie (encoded as 0)
                prediction = 0
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** checks if the penguin is from Torgersen island (`island == 2`). If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), the penguin is predicted to be **Adelie** (`prediction = 0`).

- If **Node 0** is not satisfied (`nodes[0] == 0`), we proceed to **Node 1**, which checks if the penguin is from Biscoe island (`island == 0`).

  - If **Node 1** is satisfied (`nodes[1] == 1`), we proceed to **Node 2**, which checks if the penguin's flipper length is greater than or equal to 210.0 mm (`flipper_length_mm >= 210.0`).
  
    - If **Node 2** is satisfied (`nodes[2] == 1`), the penguin is predicted to be **Gentoo** (`prediction = 2`).
    
    - If **Node 2** is not satisfied (`nodes[2] == 0`), the penguin is predicted to be **Adelie** (`prediction = 0`).
  
  - If **Node 1** is not satisfied (`nodes[1] == 0`), we proceed to **Node 3**, which checks if the penguin's culmen depth is less than 17.0 mm (`culmen_depth_mm < 17.0`).
  
    - If **Node 3** is satisfied (`nodes[3] == 1`), the penguin is predicted to be **Chinstrap** (`prediction = 1`).
    
    - If **Node 3** is not satisfied (`nodes[3] == 0`), the penguin is predicted to be **Adelie** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a penguin with the following features:

```python
penguin_features = {
    'island': 0,               # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 50.0,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 15.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 220.0,
    'body_mass_g': 5000,
    'sex': 2                   # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted species: 2
Nodes truth values: [0, 1, 1, None]
```

- The predicted species is `2`, which corresponds to **Gentoo**.
- The truth values of the nodes indicate which conditions were satisfied during the prediction.

**Note:**

- The `nodes` list may contain `None` for nodes that were not evaluated due to the flow of the decision tree.
- The feature encoding and threshold values match the provided details, ensuring accurate predictions based on the decision tree.
