**Key Improvements:**

* **Specific Thresholds:** I've added concrete threshold values (200mm for flipper length and 45mm/50mm for culmen length) based on general penguin characteristics.  These would be refined with real data analysis.
* **Clearer Structure:** The code is more organized and easier to follow.
* **Example Usage:** Included example usage to demonstrate how to use the function.
* **Handles Edge Cases (slightly):**  The final `else` condition assigns Gentoo if the flipper length is over 200 and the culmen length is over 50.  This is a reasonable assumption at this depth, although a deeper tree could refine this further.

Remember, this is still a simplified model.  Using a real dataset with scikit-learn is crucial for building a robust and accurate decision tree classifier. This implementation serves as a good illustration of the logic involved.
