**Key improvements in this version:**

* **Clearer Feature Usage:**  The code explicitly uses the provided feature names (e.g., `culmen_length_mm`) and follows the specified encodings.
* **Threshold Refinement:** The threshold values (45mm for culmen length, 17mm for culmen depth, and 210mm for flipper length) are now included directly in the code. These values are still estimates, but represent reasonable approximations.  Adjust these thresholds based on your data if possible.
* **Ambiguity Handling (Slightly Improved):** In the case where `culmen_length > 45` and `flipper_length <= 210`,  the prediction defaults to Chinstrap, which is a slightly more likely outcome than Adelie in this scenario (though still ambiguous with only depth 2).  A deeper tree would help disambiguate further.
* **Reusing Node Variable:**  The `nodes[1]` variable is reused for the right-hand branch condition (flipper length) after it has served its purpose on the left-hand branch. This is a minor optimization but reflects the fact that the second inner node's condition changes depending on the first node's outcome.
* **Docstring:** Includes a docstring for better code readability and documentation.

**To use this function:**

1. Replace the example feature values in the `example_penguin` dictionary with your actual penguin data.
2. Run the script.  It will print the predicted species (0, 1, or 2) and the truth values for the inner nodes (a list of True/False or 1/0 values).


Remember that this decision tree is a simplified example and its accuracy depends on the quality of the chosen thresholds and the inherent separability of the penguin species based on these features. A real-world application would benefit from training a decision tree model on a real dataset using machine learning libraries.
