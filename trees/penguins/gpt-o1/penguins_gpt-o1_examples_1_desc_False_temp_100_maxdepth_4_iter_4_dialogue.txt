Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for penguin species prediction. The function follows your specifications:

- It returns a single prediction (as per the target encoding: 0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo).
- It returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`), with `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
- It uses the exact feature keys and adheres to the specified encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to hold truth values for 3 inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if island == Dream (encoded as 1)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['island'] == 1 else 0

    # Node 1: Check if island == Torgersen (encoded as 2)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['island'] == 2 else 0

    # Node 2: Check if flipper_length_mm <= 210.0
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 210.0 else 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If island == Dream
        prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If island == Torgersen
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If flipper_length_mm <= 210.0
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - **island:** Encoded as:
    - `0` = Biscoe
    - `1` = Dream
    - `2` = Torgersen
  - **flipper_length_mm:** Numerical value representing the flipper length in millimeters.

- **Nodes and Their Conditions:**
  - **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if the penguin is from **Dream** island.
    ```python
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['island'] == 1 else 0
    ```
  - **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if the penguin is from **Torgersen** island.
    ```python
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['island'] == 2 else 0
    ```
  - **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):** Checks if the `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to **210.0 mm**.
    ```python
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 210.0 else 0
    ```

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If `nodes[0]` is `1`:** The penguin is from **Dream** island.
    - **Prediction:** `1` (Chinstrap)
  - **Else If `nodes[1]` is `1`:** The penguin is from **Torgersen** island.
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Adelie)
  - **Else:**
    - **If `nodes[2]` is `1`:** `flipper_length_mm` â‰¤ 210.0
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Adelie)
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** `2` (Gentoo)

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a penguin with the following features:

```python
X_example = {
    'island': 0,              # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 45.0,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 14.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 220.0,
    'body_mass_g': 5000,
    'sex': 2                  # Male
}
```

We can predict the species as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected output: 2 (Gentoo)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Truth values of the nodes
```

**Note on Placeholders and Meaningful Thresholds:**

- The threshold for `flipper_length_mm` is set at **210.0 mm**, which is a meaningful value to distinguish between species:
  - **Adelie** penguins typically have shorter flippers.
  - **Gentoo** penguins have longer flippers (> 210.0 mm).

**Final Remarks:**

- The function adheres to a maximum depth of **4** (including both decision and leaf nodes), as per your requirement.
- All feature names and encodings are used exactly as specified.
- The function is designed to be clear and easy to understand, matching the structure of the decision tree you provided.
