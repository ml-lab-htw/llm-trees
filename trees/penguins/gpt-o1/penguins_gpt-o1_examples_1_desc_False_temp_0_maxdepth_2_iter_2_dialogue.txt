**Important Notes:**

* The chosen thresholds (45mm for culmen length and 17mm for culmen depth) are educated guesses based on general knowledge about penguin species.  These values are NOT optimal and should be determined using a decision tree training algorithm with real data.  The tree structure and thresholds in a real-world application would be more nuanced.
*  Without training data, it's challenging to accurately choose the thresholds, especially for the second level of the tree when culmen length is greater than 45mm. This region might contain a mix of Chinstrap and Gentoo, or even Adelie, and proper training is crucial for accurate differentiation.
* The example code demonstrates the desired function structure and logic. You'll want to replace the placeholder thresholds with values obtained after training a model on a real penguin dataset.  Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` would be a good tool for this task.
