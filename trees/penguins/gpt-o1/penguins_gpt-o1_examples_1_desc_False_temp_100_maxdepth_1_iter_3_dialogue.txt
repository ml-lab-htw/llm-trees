Sure! Based on the features and the requirement of a maximum depth of 1, we'll create a simple decision tree to classify penguin species. We'll use the `flipper_length_mm` feature since it's one of the most distinguishing features between Adelie and Gentoo penguins.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Only one decision node
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Decision Tree:**

  ```
  |--- flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
      |--- class: 0 (Adelie)
  |--- flipper_length_mm > 205.0
      |--- class: 2 (Gentoo)
  ```

- **Feature Used:** `flipper_length_mm`
- **Threshold:** `205.0` mm

**Rationale:**

- **Flipper Length:** Gentoo penguins have significantly longer flipper lengths (average around 217 mm) compared to Adelie penguins (average around 190 mm).
- By setting the threshold at `205.0` mm, we effectively distinguish Gentoo penguins from Adelie penguins.
- **Chinstrap Penguins:** With a maximum depth of 1, we cannot perfectly classify Chinstrap penguins. They have flipper lengths that often overlap with Adelie penguins (average around 195 mm). In this tree, they will be classified as Adelie (class `0`).

**Function Details:**

- **Input:** A dictionary `X` with the following keys (make sure to use exact spelling and casing):

  ```python
  ['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex']
  ```

- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: An integer representing the predicted species.
    - `0`: Adelie
    - `2`: Gentoo
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value (`True` or `False`) of the decision node condition.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
penguin_features = {
    'island': 0,               # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 181.0,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2                   # Male
}

# Predict species
species_prediction, node_values = predict(penguin_features)

print(f"Predicted species: {species_prediction}")
print(f"Decision node values: {node_values}")
```

**Note:**

- **Chinstrap penguins (class `1`):** This simplified model does not distinguish Chinstrap penguins (due to the maximum depth constraint). They will be classified as Adelie.
- Ensure that all feature values are provided in the correct units and encodings as specified.

**Feature Encodings and Ranges:**

- **island:**
  - `0`: Biscoe
  - `1`: Dream
  - `2`: Torgersen
- **sex:**
  - `0`: `nan` (missing information)
  - `1`: Female
  - `2`: Male

**Final Remarks:**

This function provides a simple classification based on flipper length. While it's not perfect (especially for Chinstrap penguins), it demonstrates how to implement a decision tree of maximum depth 1 using the most significant feature.
