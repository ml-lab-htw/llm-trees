Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for predicting the species of penguins, with a maximum depth of 1. It uses the feature `flipper_length_mm` based on the thresholds and reasoning explained earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the penguin species using a decision tree of depth 1.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing feature keys and corresponding values.
              Keys: 
              ['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 
               'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex']
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
           - prediction (int): The predicted class (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
           - nodes (list): Truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # One inner node at depth 1
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of `predict` function:
1. **Input**:
   - The function accepts a dictionary `X` where the keys correspond to the exact feature names (case-sensitive) and the values are the feature values for a single sample.

2. **Decision Logic**:
   - The single decision criterion (node) checks whether the feature `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to `206.0`.
   - If `True`, classify the sample as `Adelie` (class 0).
   - If `False`, classify the sample as `Gentoo` (class 2).
   - Chinstrap (class 1) is not included in this depth-1 tree because we only split on one feature, and Chinstrap penguins often overlap with others in `flipper_length_mm`.

3. **Nodes List**:
   - The `nodes` list contains a single value representing whether the inner node condition (`flipper_length_mm <= 206.0`) was satisfied:
     - `1` if the condition is satisfied (`True`).
     - `0` if the condition is not satisfied (`False`).

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
      - The predicted species (integer class label: 0 for Adelie, 2 for Gentoo).
      - The list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Input Feature dictionary for a sample penguin
sample = {
    "island": 0,  # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 39.5,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 17.4,
    "flipper_length_mm": 202.0,
    "body_mass_g": 4050,
    "sex": 2  # male
}

# Predict the class (species) and inner node conditions
prediction, nodes = predict(sample)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Adelie)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1]
```

You can customize the thresholds or logic further if you have actual data distributions or additional requirements.
