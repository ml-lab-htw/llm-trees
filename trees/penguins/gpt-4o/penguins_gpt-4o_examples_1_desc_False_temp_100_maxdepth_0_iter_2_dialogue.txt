Here's the Python function for the decision tree using the given feature names and target encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on "island" feature
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If island == Torgersen
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        # Second split on "island" feature for the remaining islands (Biscoe and Dream)
        nodes[1] = X["island"] == 0  # Biscoe
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If island == Biscoe
            # Third split on "flipper_length_mm" feature
            nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210
            
            if nodes[2]:  # If flipper length <= 210 mm
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:  # If flipper length > 210 mm
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:  # If island == Dream
            # Third split on "culmen_depth_mm" feature
            nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0
            
            if nodes[2]:  # If culmen depth <= 17.0 mm
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:  # If culmen depth > 17.0 mm
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the **island** feature. If the penguin is from **Torgersen** (encoded as `2`), the prediction is **Adelie** (encoded as `0`).
2. **Node 1**: If the penguin is not from Torgersen, we check if it is from **Biscoe** (encoded as `0`).
3. **Node 2**: 
   - If the penguin is from Biscoe, the decision is based on **flipper length**:
     - If the flipper length is less than or equal to 210 mm, the prediction is **Chinstrap** (encoded as `1`).
     - Otherwise, it's predicted to be **Gentoo** (encoded as `2`).
   - If the penguin is from **Dream** (encoded as `1`), the decision is based on **culmen depth**:
     - If the culmen depth is less than or equal to 17.0 mm, the prediction is **Chinstrap** (encoded as `1`).
     - Otherwise, it's predicted to be **Adelie** (encoded as `0`).

This function returns both the predicted species and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
