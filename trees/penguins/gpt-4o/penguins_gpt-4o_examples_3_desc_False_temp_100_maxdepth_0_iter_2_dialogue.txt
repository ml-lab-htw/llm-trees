```python
def predict_penguin_species(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45.0
    nodes[1] = 45.0 < X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 50.0 and X['island'] in [1, 2]  # 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen
    nodes[2] = X['culmen_length_mm'] > 50.0 and X['body_mass_g'] <= 5000

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
                
    return prediction, nodes

# Example input
X = {
    'island': 1,              # Dream
    'culmen_length_mm': 46.0,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 202,
    'body_mass_g': 4500,
    'sex': 2                # male
}

# Predict penguin species
prediction, nodes = predict_penguin_species(X)
print('Predicted species:', prediction)
print('Decision path:', nodes)
```

In this function:
- `nodes` is a list that records the truth values of the conditions at the internal nodes of the decision tree.
- Each index in the `nodes` list corresponds to a decision point in the decision tree.
- Conditions are evaluated in sequence as per the structure of the tree.
- The `prediction` variable holds the final classification result based on the truth values of the nodes.

**Note:**
- The input `X` is a dictionary where each key matches the exact keys specified.
- This example explicitly handles the conditions and sequences for decision making as per the hypothetical decision tree described earlier.
  
The function efficiently returns the predicted species alongside the decision path taken.
