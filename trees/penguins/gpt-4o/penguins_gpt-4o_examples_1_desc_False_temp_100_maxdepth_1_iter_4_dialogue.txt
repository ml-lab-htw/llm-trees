Here's the required Python function for the decision tree classifier, formatted to classify penguin species based on the `flipper_length_mm` feature, as described earlier, while complying with the specified format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
    based on the given features and a decision tree of max depth 1.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
            - 'island' (0 = Biscoe / 1 = Dream / 2 = Torgersen)
            - 'culmen_length_mm' (float)
            - 'culmen_depth_mm' (float)
            - 'flipper_length_mm' (float)
            - 'body_mass_g' (float)
            - 'sex' (0 = nan / 1 = female / 2 = male)

    Returns:
        int: The predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
        list: A list of truth values of the inner nodes (1 = condition satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5

    if nodes[0]:  # If flipper_length_mm <= 206.5
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206.5
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Inputs**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the features specified in the dataset (e.g., `island`, `culmen_length_mm`, `culmen_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`).
   - Pay close attention to the keys of the dictionary being consistent with the feature names provided.

2. **Decision Logic**:
   - The only feature used in this decision tree is `flipper_length_mm`.
   - The tree has a maximum depth of 1 and splits based on whether `flipper_length_mm` is below or above `206.5`.

3. **Outputs**:
   - **`prediction`**: The species prediction based on the decision tree:
     - `0` = Adelie
     - `2` = Gentoo
   - **`nodes`**: A list containing the truth values of the conditions at decision nodes:
     - `1` if the condition at the node is satisfied (e.g., `flipper_length_mm <= 206.5`).
     - `0` otherwise.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input: A penguin with flipper length of 200 mm
X = {
    "island": 0,  # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 39.5,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 17.4,
    "flipper_length_mm": 200.0,
    "body_mass_g": 3750.0,
    "sex": 1  # female
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Adelie)
print("Decision Node Values:", nodes)  # Output: [1]
```

Another Example:
```python
# Input: A penguin with flipper length of 215 mm
X = {
    "island": 2,  # Torgersen
    "culmen_length_mm": 50.2,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 15.0,
    "flipper_length_mm": 215.0,
    "body_mass_g": 5000.0,
    "sex": 2  # male
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 2 (Gentoo)
print("Decision Node Values:", nodes)  # Output: [0]
``` 

This function provides classification for Adelie and Gentoo penguins. Chinstrap penguins are not accounted for in this depth-1 decision tree. For a more robust classification, features like `culmen_length_mm` or `culmen_depth_mm` might be considered at deeper levels of the tree.
