Sure, let's format the decision tree into a Python function according to the specifications. I'll ensure to capture the logic from the decision tree provided earlier and use meaningful thresholds based on typical ranges observed in the data.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 1  # Dream
    nodes[1] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen
    nodes[2] = (X["island"] == 0) and (X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.5)  # Biscoe and culmen_length_mm <= 45.5

    if nodes[0]:  # Dream
        prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    elif nodes[1]:  # Torgersen
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    elif nodes[2]:  # Biscoe and culmen_length_mm <= 45.5
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # Biscoe and culmen_length_mm > 45.5
        if X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 50,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 15,
    'flipper_length_mm': 210,
    'body_mass_g': 4500,
    'sex': 1  # female
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]**: Checks if the penguin is from the Dream island.
2. **nodes[1]**: Checks if the penguin is from the Torgersen island.
3. **nodes[2]**: Checks if the penguin is from the Biscoe island and has a `culmen_length_mm` less than or equal to 45.5.

### Decision Path:
- If the penguin is from Dream island (nodes[0] is True), it predicts Chinstrap.
- If the penguin is from Torgersen island (nodes[1] is True), it predicts Adelie.
- If the penguin is from Biscoe island and has a `culmen_length_mm` less than or equal to 45.5 (nodes[2] is True), it predicts Adelie.
- If none of these nodes are True, then it's from Biscoe with `culmen_length_mm` greater than 45.5:
  - Further check on `culmen_depth_mm`: 
    - If `culmen_depth_mm` is less than or equal to 17.0, predicts Gentoo.
    - Otherwise, predicts Chinstrap.

This function covers the logic tree path and also returns the states of the nodes. Ensure to replace the threshold values with more accurate ones if you have the exact data.
