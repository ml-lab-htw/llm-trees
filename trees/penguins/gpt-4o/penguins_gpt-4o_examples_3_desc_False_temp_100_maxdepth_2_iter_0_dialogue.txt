Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 based on the given features to classify penguin species. It will return a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.5
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If culmen_length <= 45.5
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If flipper_length <= 205.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'island': 1,               # Dream
    'culmen_length_mm': 46.5,  # greater than 45.5
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 210,  # greater than 205.0
    'body_mass_g': 5000,
    'sex': 2                   # male
}

# Predicting the species
species, nodes = predict(X)

species_names = ["Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"]
print(f"Predicted species: {species_names[species]}")  # Output: Gentoo
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [False, False]
```

In this function:
1. The first node checks if the "culmen_length_mm" is less than or equal to 45.5. If true, the penguin is classified as "Adelie".
2. If the "culmen_length_mm" is greater than 45.5, the function checks if the "flipper_length_mm" is less than or equal to 205. If it is, the penguin is classified as "Chinstrap". Otherwise, it is classified as "Gentoo".

The `nodes` list will contain the truth values of these conditions to help you trace the decision path. Note that the second check (`nodes[1]`) is only meaningful if the first check failed (`nodes[0]` is `False`).
