Here’s a Python function based on the decision tree we created for classifying penguin species. The function will take a dictionary of features (`X`) as input, return the predicted species as well as a list of truth values corresponding to the conditions used in the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    # Node 0: Check culmen length <= 45.0
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0

    if nodes[0]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
        # Node 1: Check if island == Torgersen (encoded as 2)
        nodes[1] = X["island"] == 2

        if nodes[1]:  # island == Torgersen
            prediction = 0  # Adelie (species = 0)
        else:  # island != Torgersen
            # Node 2: Check if sex == male (encoded as 2)
            nodes[2] = X["sex"] == 2

            if nodes[2]:  # sex == male
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap (species = 1)
            else:  # sex != male
                prediction = 0  # Adelie (species = 0)
    else:  # culmen_length_mm > 45.0
        # Node 3: Check flipper length <= 210.0
        nodes[3] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210.0

        if nodes[3]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 210.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap (species = 1)
        else:  # flipper_length_mm > 210.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo (species = 2)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Nodes and Conditions:**
   - The function starts by initializing a list `nodes` with `None`. Each element of this list corresponds to an inner node in the decision tree, where the value `1` indicates the condition at that node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.
   - For example, `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `culmen_length_mm <= 45.0`.

2. **Hierarchical Structure:**
   - The code logically follows the decision tree structure. For example, if `nodes[0]` (culmen length) is satisfied, the prediction then depends on additional conditions like the island and sex.

3. **Prediction Output:**
   - The variable `prediction` stores the final classification of the species (`0 = Adelie`, `1 = Chinstrap`, `2 = Gentoo`).

4. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted species (0, 1, or 2).
     - `nodes`: A list of `1` or `0` values indicating whether the conditions at the nodes were satisfied.

### Example Usage
Here’s how you can use this function to make a prediction:

```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "island": 2,  # Torgersen
    "culmen_length_mm": 42.0,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 19.5,  # Not used in this tree
    "flipper_length_mm": 200,
    "body_mass_g": 3800,  # Not used in this tree
    "sex": 1  # female
}

# Prediction
species, nodes = predict(X)
print("Predicted species:", species)  # Output: 0 (Adelie)
print("Truth values of nodes:", nodes)  # Example output: [True, True, False, False]
```

### Tree Evaluation
- **Maximum Depth:** 4 (as specified).
- **Features Used:** Meaningful thresholds are selected based on the biological traits of penguins:
  - `culmen_length_mm` is important for distinguishing between Adelie and the other species.
  - `island` helps further refine the classification.
  - `sex` is used to separate Adelie and Chinstrap penguins further in the shorter culmen length case.
  - `flipper_length_mm` is used to distinguish Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins for longer culmen lengths.
