def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Split based on flipper length
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node: Split based on culmen depth for non-Gentoo penguins
        nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.05
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Python function:
- **`nodes[0]`** checks whether the flipper length is less than or equal to 206 mm. If this is true, the penguin is either an Adelie or a Chinstrap. If false, the penguin is classified as a Gentoo (since Gentoo penguins generally have longer flippers).
  
- **`nodes[1]`** is only evaluated for penguins with a flipper length <= 206 mm. It checks whether the culmen depth is less than or equal to 18.05 mm. If true, the penguin is classified as an Adelie, otherwise as a Chinstrap.

- The function returns two things:
  1. The **`prediction`** (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo).
  2. A list of truth values (**`nodes`**) representing whether the conditions at each inner node were satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false). This provides information about the internal decision process for each prediction.
