Based on the provided examples and the given decision tree structure for penguin classification, I'll create a Python function that follows a similar pattern. The function will use the specified features and return a single prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.

Here is the function based on the decision tree discussed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to hold the truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = [None, None]

    # Define the decision tree conditions and populate the nodes list
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 16.0

    # Make predictions based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "island": 0,              # Assuming we don't use it in this specific tree
    "culmen_length_mm": 46.0,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 15.0,
    "flipper_length_mm": 210, # Assuming we don't use it in this specific tree
    "body_mass_g": 4500,      # Assuming we don't use it in this specific tree
    "sex": 1                  # Assuming we don't use it in this specific tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
1. The function `predict(X: dict)` accepts a dictionary `X` containing the features.
2. The `nodes` list is initialized to hold the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. The decision conditions are applied based on `culmen_length_mm` and `culmen_depth_mm`.
4. The decision tree uses these conditions to classify the penguin species.
5. The function returns the predicted class and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

This function follows the structure and format provided in the examples. Adjustments to the threshold values or the feature importance can be made as needed based on the actual data analysis.
