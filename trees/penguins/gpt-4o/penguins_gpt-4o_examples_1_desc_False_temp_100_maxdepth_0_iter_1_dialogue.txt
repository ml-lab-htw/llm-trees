Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features and target variable you provided. The function returns a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list for storing inner node conditions (truth values)
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the penguin is on Biscoe island (island == 0)
    nodes[0] = X["island"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: If not on Biscoe, check if the culmen length is <= 40.5 mm
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 40.5
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the penguin is on Biscoe, it is Gentoo (class 2)
        prediction = 2
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If culmen length is <= 40.5, it is Adelie (class 0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If culmen length is > 40.5, it is Chinstrap (class 1)
            prediction = 1

    # Return the prediction and the list of truth values for inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The input `X` is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a feature (e.g., `"island"`, `"culmen_length_mm"`).
- The `nodes` list holds the truth values for the two inner nodes of the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the penguin is on **Biscoe** island (`X["island"] == 0`).
  - `nodes[1]`: (Only evaluated if not on Biscoe) Checks if the **culmen length** is less than or equal to **40.5 mm**.
- Based on these conditions, the function predicts the penguin species:
  - If the penguin is on **Biscoe**, it is classified as **Gentoo** (`class 2`).
  - If the penguin is not on Biscoe and has a **culmen length â‰¤ 40.5 mm**, it is classified as **Adelie** (`class 0`).
  - Otherwise, it is classified as **Chinstrap** (`class 1`).

This function is structured exactly like the decision tree you asked for, and it imitates the decision-making process based on the two most important features (`island` and `culmen_length_mm`).
