Here's the desired Python function that generates predictions based on a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for the penguin species classification task:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check culmen length
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        # If culmen length > 45.0, check the island
        nodes[1] = (X["island"] == 0 or X["island"] == 1)  # Biscoe or Dream
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {"island": 2, "culmen_length_mm": 50.0, "culmen_depth_mm": 15.0, "flipper_length_mm": 200.0, "body_mass_g": 4500, "sex": 2}
# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision node checks if the `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45.0 mm. If this condition is satisfied, it assigns the species as Adelie (0). Otherwise, it proceeds to the next decision node.
   
2. **Node 1**: The second decision node checks if the `island` value is either 0 (Biscoe) or 1 (Dream). If true, it assigns the species as Gentoo (2). If the `island` is Torgersen (2), the species is classified as Chinstrap (1).

The function returns the predicted species, as well as a list that represents the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
You can uncomment and modify the example usage section to test the function with different feature values. The dictionary `X` should contain the correct feature names and their corresponding values according to your data.
