Given the features and target variable encoding you provided, let's define the function `predict` for classifying penguin species using a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. We'll use culmen length and culmen depth as the most distinguishing features in the decision tree.

Here is the function implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list with None values representing the conditions of the inner nodes
    
    # Check the condition for the first node
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.5  # Node 0 checks if culmen_length_mm is <= 45.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If node 0 condition is True (culmen_length_mm <= 45.5)
        prediction = 0  # Predict Adelie
    else:
        # Check the condition for the second node if the first node condition is False (culmen_length_mm > 45.5)
        nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 15.5  # Node 1 checks if culmen_depth_mm is <= 15.5
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If node 1 condition is True
            prediction = 2  # Predict Gentoo
        else:
            # If node 1 condition is False
            prediction = 1  # Predict Chinstrap

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this implementation:
- The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
- The first condition checks if the culmen length is less than or equal to 45.5 mm. If true, it directly predicts Adelie (encoded as 0).
- If the first condition is false, it checks the second condition: if the culmen depth is less than or equal to 15.5 mm. If true, it predicts Gentoo (encoded as 2), and if false, it predicts Chinstrap (encoded as 1).

This function returns the predicted species along with the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
