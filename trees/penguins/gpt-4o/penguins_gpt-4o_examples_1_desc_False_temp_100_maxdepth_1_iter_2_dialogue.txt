Based on your instructions, I will construct a Python function to represent a depth-1 decision tree for predicting penguin species using **flipper_length_mm** as the most important feature. The predictions will be encoded as follows:  
- `0 = Adelie`,  
- `1 = Chinstrap`,  
- `2 = Gentoo`.

The exact thresholds for `flipper_length_mm` are empirically chosen based on our theoretical knowledge, assuming:
- Adelie penguins have a flipper length â‰¤ 206 mm,  
- Chinstrap penguins have flipper lengths between 206 mm and 217 mm,  
- Gentoo penguins have flipper lengths > 217 mm.

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) 
    based on the feature 'flipper_length_mm'. Returns both the prediction 
    and the truth values of the inner nodes.
    
    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the penguin features: 
              ['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 
               'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex']
              
    Returns:
    int: The predicted class (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo).
    list: A list representing the truth values of inner nodes 
          (1 if the node condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    
    # List to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: flipper_length_mm <= 206
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the first condition is True, predict Adelie
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: flipper_length_mm <= 217
        nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 217.0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the second condition is True, predict Chinstrap
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Gentoo
            prediction = 2
            
    # Return the prediction and the list of truth values for nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
```python
# Example input: Penguin data
penguin_features = {
    "island": 1,               # Dream Island
    "culmen_length_mm": 48.7,  # Culmen length in mm
    "culmen_depth_mm": 17.4,   # Culmen depth in mm
    "flipper_length_mm": 212,  # Flipper length in mm
    "body_mass_g": 4500,       # Body mass in grams
    "sex": 2                   # Male
}

# Get prediction and truth values for the inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Chinstrap)
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree
1. The first inner node checks whether the penguin's flipper length is less than or equal to 206 mm:
   - If true, the species is predicted as Adelie (`prediction = 0`).
2. If the first condition is false, the second inner node checks if the flipper length is less than or equal to 217 mm:
   - If true, the species is predicted as Chinstrap (`prediction = 1`).
3. If both conditions are false, the species is predicted as Gentoo (`prediction = 2`).

The `nodes` list contains the truth values for each inner node condition:
- `nodes[0] = True` if `flipper_length_mm <= 206.0`, false otherwise.
- `nodes[1] = True` if `flipper_length_mm <= 217.0`, false otherwise.
