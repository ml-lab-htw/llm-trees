Here is the Python function based on your request that implements a decision tree classifier with a depth of 2. It predicts the species of penguins using the provided features and returns the prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: culmen_length_mm <= 45.35
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.35

    if nodes[0]:
        # If culmen length is less than or equal to 45.35, predict Adelie (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: flipper_length_mm <= 205.00
        nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.00

        if nodes[1]:
            # If flipper length is less than or equal to 205, predict Chinstrap (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If flipper length is greater than 205, predict Gentoo (2)
            prediction = 2

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the penguin's `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45.35. If true, the species is predicted to be **Adelie** (0).
- If **Node 0** is false, the tree moves to **Node 1**, where it checks if the penguin's `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 205. If true, the species is predicted to be **Chinstrap** (1).
- If **Node 1** is false, the species is predicted to be **Gentoo** (2).
  
### Example usage:
```python
X = {
    "island": 0,  # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 50.0,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18.5,
    "flipper_length_mm": 220.0,
    "body_mass_g": 5000,
    "sex": 2,  # male
    "species": None  # unknown, as this is the prediction target
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function will return both the predicted species and the truth values of the inner nodes, which allows you to see the decision path taken.
