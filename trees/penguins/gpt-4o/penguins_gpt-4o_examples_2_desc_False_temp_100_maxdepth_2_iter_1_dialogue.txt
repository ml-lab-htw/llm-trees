Let's write a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting the penguin species based on the given features. 

Here is the function with the correct feature keys and based on the decision tree we previously discussed:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Handling the first split
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.50
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Prediction if first split is true
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        # Handling the second split if first split is false
        nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 195.00
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Prediction if second split is true
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            # Prediction if second split is false
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
- It initializes a list `nodes` to hold boolean values indicating whether the conditions at each node are satisfied.
- The first node checks if `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 42.50.
  - If true, the function predicts the species as Adelie (0).
  - If false, it proceeds to the second node.
- The second node checks if `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 195.00.
  - If true, it predicts the species as Chinstrap (1).
  - If false, it predicts the species as Gentoo (2).

This function returns the prediction and the list of boolean values indicating the results of the inner node checks.
