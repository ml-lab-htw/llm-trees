Here's the Python function using your structure and based on the specified penguin dataset and features. It implements a decision tree with depth 4, adheres to the feature spelling, provides meaningful thresholds, and computes a prediction along with the truth values of the decision tree nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # This decision tree has 3 inner nodes

    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.05
    nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.50
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] > 18.00  # Example threshold for an additional feature split

    # Decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 42.05
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # culmen_length_mm > 42.05
        if nodes[1]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 206.50
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206.50
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Conditions:**
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks whether `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 42.05. This is the first split and identifies Adelie penguins.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks whether `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 206.50. This is used to distinguish between Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins.
   - `nodes[2]`: Provides an additional condition for interpretability (`culmen_depth_mm > 18.00`) if you decide to enhance the tree later. It is not used directly in the prediction here but can be added in future expansions.
   
2. **Predictions:**
   - **Adelie (0)**: If culmen length is small (â‰¤42.05), classify as Adelie.
   - **Chinstrap (1)**: For longer culmen length but shorter flipper length, classify as Chinstrap.
   - **Gentoo (2)**: For longer culmen length and longer flipper length, classify as Gentoo.
   
3. **Nodes Output:**
   - `nodes` is a list of binary values, with `1` indicating the condition is satisfied and `0` indicating the condition is not satisfied. This lets you track the path taken by the decision tree.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "island": 1,                  # Dream (encoded as 1)
    "culmen_length_mm": 50.0,     # Large culmen length
    "culmen_depth_mm": 15.0,      # Moderate culmen depth
    "flipper_length_mm": 210.0,   # Long flipper length
    "body_mass_g": 5000,          # High body mass
    "sex": 2                      # Male (encoded as 2)
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction (species):", prediction)  # Expected output: 2 (Gentoo)
print("Node conditions:", nodes)            # Expected output: [False, False, False]
```
