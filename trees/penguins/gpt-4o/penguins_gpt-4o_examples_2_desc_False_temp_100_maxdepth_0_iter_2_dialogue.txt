To translate the described decision tree into a Python function, you can follow the format below. I'm integrating meaningful threshold values into the decision tree based on common penguin trait distributions. 

For penguin species classification: 
- Adelie penguins generally have shorter culmen lengths.
- Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins have longer culmen lengths, but Chinstrap penguins tend to have shallower culmen depths than Gentoo penguins. 

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210
    nodes[3] = X["island"] == 1  # Assuming island = 1 (Dream)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    "island": 1,  # Dream
    "culmen_length_mm": 50,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18,
    "flipper_length_mm": 200,
    "body_mass_g": 4500,
    "sex": 1  # Female
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, node_truths = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} | Node Truths: {node_truths}")
```

### Explanation:
1. We initialize `nodes` as a list with `None` values to hold boolean values (True or False).
2. The conditions in `nodes` list correspond to the inner nodes of the decision tree.
   - `nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42` determines if the penguin is an Adelie based on the culmen length.
   - `nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17` helps to distinguish Chinstrap penguins if the culmen length condition is not met.
   - `nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210` differentiates between Gentoo penguins if previous conditions point to Gentoo characteristics.
   - `nodes[3] = X["island"] == 1` can be used to refine the tree based on specific island distribution but is included to ensure flexibility if island-based distinctions are needed.
3. The nested if-else structure uses the conditions in `nodes` to arrive at a prediction for the species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo).

Feel free to adjust the threshold values or conditions based on more specific knowledge about penguin species you might have.
