By applying the decision tree logic we discussed earlier, we can now implement a Python function that takes in the features of a penguin and returns both the predicted species and the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here is how we can define the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list with None values
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Evaluate the nodes based on the input features
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 43.39
    nodes[1] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 207.5
    
    # Decision logic based on nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # culmen_length <= 43.39
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # culmen_length > 43.39
        if nodes[1]:  # flipper_length <= 207.5
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # flipper_length > 207.5
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
# Example input dictionary representing a penguin's features:
example_input = {
    'island': 1,  # not used in this decision tree
    'culmen_length_mm': 44.5,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.2,  # not used in this decision tree
    'flipper_length_mm': 210,
    'body_mass_g': 4500,  # not used in this decision tree
    'sex': 2  # not used in this decision tree
}

# Get prediction and node values
prediction, node_values = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Node Values: {node_values}")
```

Explanation:
- The `predict` function initialises a list `nodes` with `None` values which will later store boolean values indicating whether the respective node condition is satisfied or not.
- The first node (`nodes[0]`) checks if `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 43.39.
- The second node (`nodes[1]`) checks if `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 207.5.
- Based on the evaluation of these conditions, the function navigates the decision tree and returns the prediction along with the node truth values.

To see this in action, you can replace `example_input` with different sets of feature values to test how the decision tree functions and what predictions it gives.
