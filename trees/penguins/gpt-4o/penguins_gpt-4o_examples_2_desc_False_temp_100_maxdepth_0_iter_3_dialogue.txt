```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification:**

This function implements the simplified decision tree described in the previous response.

* **`nodes` list:** Stores the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node.  In this case, we have two decision nodes.
* **Node 0:** Checks if `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 200 mm.
* **Node 1:** Checks if `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45 mm.
* **Prediction Logic:** The `if/else` structure follows the branches of the decision tree to arrive at the final prediction (0, 1, or 2).

**Threshold Selection:**

The chosen thresholds (200mm for flipper length and 45mm for culmen length) are reasonable approximations based on the general distribution of these features in the Palmer Penguins dataset.  Flipper length is a strong separator between Gentoo and the other two species, and culmen length helps distinguish Adelie from Chinstrap.

**Example Usage:**

```python
penguin_features = {
    'island': 0,  # Biscoe
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7,
    'flipper_length_mm': 195,
    'body_mass_g': 3750,
    'sex': 2,  # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")        # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


penguin_features_2 = {
    'island': 2,  # Torgersen
    'culmen_length_mm': 47.5,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 15.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 215,
    'body_mass_g': 4950,
    'sex': 1 # Female
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin_features_2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 2 (Gentoo)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")        # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```



To improve the accuracy of the tree and find optimal thresholds, you'd want to train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` using a machine learning library like scikit-learn, as shown in the previous example.  This code provides a functional implementation of the simplified tree for illustrative purposes.
