Sure, based on the given dataset, features, and target variable, here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict_penguin(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Nodes
    nodes[0] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 45.5
    nodes[1] = X['culmen_length_mm'] <= 50.0
    nodes[2] = X['island'] == 1  # Dream Island
    nodes[3] = X['island'] == 0  # Biscoe Island
    nodes[4] = X['culmen_length_mm'] > 50.0
    nodes[5] = X['flipper_length_mm'] <= 210.0

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie (Since the node for Biscoe was not evaluated yet)
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 2  # Gentoo
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap or Adelie based on further nodes which are not evaluated in this tree

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage:
features = {
    'island': 1,  # Dream
    'culmen_length_mm': 46.0,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 17.0,
    'flipper_length_mm': 201.0,
    'body_mass_g': 3500,
    'sex': 2  # male
}

pred, node_values = predict_penguin(features)
print(f"Prediction: {pred}, Nodes: {node_values}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes Creation**:
    - Each `nodes` item represents a condition used in the decision tree.
    - `nodes[0]` checks if the `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45.5.
    - `nodes[1]` checks if the `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 50.0.
    - `nodes[2]` checks if the `island` is Dream.
    - `nodes[3]` checks if the `island` is Biscoe.
    - `nodes[4]` checks if the `culmen_length_mm` is greater than 50.0.
    - `nodes[5]` checks if the `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 210.0.

2. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The tree first splits based on the `culmen_length_mm` value.
   - If `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 45.5, classify it as Adelie (`prediction = 0`).
   - If `culmen_length_mm` is more than 45.5 but less than or equal to 50.0, further splits based on the island.
      - If on Dream Island, classify it as Chinstrap (`prediction = 1`).
      - Otherwise, classify it as Adelie (`prediction = 0`).
   - If `culmen_length_mm` is greater than 50.0, check the `flipper_length_mm`.
      - If less than or equal to 210.0, classify it as Gentoo (`prediction = 2`).
      - Else, classify it as Chinstrap (`prediction = 1`).

This Python function captures the structure of the decision tree and adheres to the feature and target variable descriptions provided. Adjustments can be made based on further examination and validation of the actual dataset.
