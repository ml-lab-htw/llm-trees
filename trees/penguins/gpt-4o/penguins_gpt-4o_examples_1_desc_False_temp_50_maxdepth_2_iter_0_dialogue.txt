Below is the Python function for the penguin species classification decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing the feature values, and returns the predicted species as well as a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the penguin species based on input features using a depth-2 decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values with the following keys:
            'island': 0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen
            'culmen_length_mm': Length of the culmen in mm.
            'culmen_depth_mm': Depth of the culmen in mm.
            'flipper_length_mm': Flipper length in mm.
            'body_mass_g': Body mass in grams.
            'sex': 0 = nan, 1 = female, 2 = male

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo).
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied) 
              for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # If culmen_length_mm > 45.0
        # Node 1: Check if flipper_length_mm <= 210.0
        nodes[1] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210.0
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If flipper_length_mm <= 210.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # If flipper_length_mm > 210.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the **culmen_length_mm** feature. If the culmen length is less than or equal to 45.0 mm, the penguin is classified as **Adelie** (species 0).
2. **Node 1**: If the penguin's culmen length is greater than 45.0 mm, the next decision is based on the **flipper_length_mm** feature. If the flipper length is less than or equal to 210.0 mm, the penguin is classified as **Chinstrap** (species 1). Otherwise, it is classified as **Gentoo** (species 2).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "island": 1,  # Dream
    "culmen_length_mm": 50.0,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18.0,
    "flipper_length_mm": 220.0,
    "body_mass_g": 5000,
    "sex": 2  # Male
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 2 (Gentoo)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
```

### Notes:
- This implementation ensures the decision tree logic is clear and interpretable.
- The thresholds (e.g., 45.0 for culmen length and 210.0 for flipper length) are meaningful and based on common distinctions in penguin species.
- The `nodes` list contains `True` (1) or `False` (0) values for each inner node condition, allowing you to trace the path taken in the decision tree.
