Below is your custom decision tree classifier for predicting penguin species, formatted as a Python function. The function `predict` returns the predicted species as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to keep track of which conditions are satisfied
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Defining the decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 46.0
    nodes[1] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 3800
    nodes[2] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210

    # Predicting based on the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If culmen_length_mm <= 46.0
        if nodes[1]:  # If body_mass_g <= 3800
            prediction = 0  # Adelie (0)
        else:  # body_mass_g > 3800
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap (1)
    else:  # culmen_length_mm > 46.0
        if nodes[2]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 210
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap (1)
        else:  # flipper_length_mm > 210
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo (2)
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# input_features = {
#     'island': 0,  # Biscoe
#     'culmen_length_mm': 43.0,
#     'culmen_depth_mm': 18.0,
#     'flipper_length_mm': 210,
#     'body_mass_g': 3500,
#     'sex': 2  # male
# }
#
# prediction, decision_path = predict(input_features)
# print("Prediction:", prediction)
# print("Decision path:", decision_path)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Decision Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 46.0 mm.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the `body_mass_g` is less than or equal to 3800 grams.
   - `nodes[2]` checks if the `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 210 mm.

2. **Decision Logic:**
   - If the `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to 46.0, it further checks if the `body_mass_g` is less than or equal to 3800 grams to classify as Adelie (0) or Chinstrap (1) based on `body_mass_g`.
   - If the `culmen_length_mm` is greater than 46.0, it checks the `flipper_length_mm`. If the `flipper_length_mm` is less than or equal to 210 mm, it classifies as Chinstrap (1). Otherwise, it classifies as Gentoo (2).

This function is structured to classify penguins based on the important features in a way that mirrors the given decision tree logic.
