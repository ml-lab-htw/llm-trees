Given the features and the target variable encoding provided, we'll implement a decision tree function in Python that adheres to your requirements. This tree will have a maximum depth of 2, and it will return the species prediction along with a list of boolean values indicating whether each node's condition is satisfied.

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.50
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.00
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            
    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
example_features = {
    'island': 1,  # Dream
    'culmen_length_mm': 47.2,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 15.5,
    'flipper_length_mm': 210,
    'body_mass_g': 4500,
    'sex': 2  # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expecting 1 (Chinstrap) based on given features
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Expecting [False, True] based on provided example features
```

This function works as follows:
1. **Initialize boolean nodes list:**  
   Create a list of `None` values, one for each decision node in the tree.
   
2. **Evaluate each node's condition:**  
   Populate the list with `True` or `False` based on whether the current input **X** satisfies each node's condition.
   
3. **Make the prediction:**  
   Use nested `if` statements reflecting the structure of the decision tree to assign the correct class label based on the evaluated conditions.

4. **Return the prediction and nodes list:**  
   Return both the predicted species and the list of boolean values representing the results of inner node evaluations.

This function satisfies the requirement of classifying penguins based on culmen length and depth and provides insight into the decision-making process by returning the truth values of the inner nodes.
