Here is the Python function based on your request to classify penguins using a decision tree of maximum depth 1. The most important feature selected for this tree is `culmen_length_mm`. The function outputs both the prediction and the list of truth values for inner nodes.

### Code:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
    based on a simple decision tree with a maximum depth of 1.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
                  ['island', 'culmen_length_mm', 'culmen_depth_mm', 
                  'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex']

    Returns:
        prediction (int): Predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
        nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize nodes list to record the conditions
    nodes = 1 * [None]

    # Decision rule based on culmen_length_mm
    nodes[0] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Perform classification based on the decision rule
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Chinstrap (culmen length <= 45.0)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie (culmen length > 45.0)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. The only decision node in the tree is based on `culmen_length_mm`.
   - If the `culmen_length_mm` is less than or equal to **45.0 mm**, the penguin species is classified as **Chinstrap** (`1`).
   - If `culmen_length_mm` is greater than **45.0 mm**, the penguin species is classified as **Adelie** (`0`).

2. The list `nodes` will contain a single boolean value (`1` = True or `0` = False), indicating whether the condition in the inner node (`culmen_length_mm <= 45.0`) is satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input features
X_sample = {
    "island": 0,              # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 47.0, # Culmen length
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18.5,  # Culmen depth
    "flipper_length_mm": 200, # Flipper length
    "body_mass_g": 3750,      # Body mass (grams)
    "sex": 2                  # Male
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Adelie)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [0] (culmen_length_mm > 45.0)
```

---

### Output for the Example:
- **Prediction:** `0` (Adelie)
- **Nodes:** `[0]` (The condition `culmen_length_mm <= 45.0` is **not** satisfied.)
