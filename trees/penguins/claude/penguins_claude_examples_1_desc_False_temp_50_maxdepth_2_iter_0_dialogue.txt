Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if flipper length is <= 205mm
4. For shorter flippers, then checks if culmen length is <= 45mm
5. Returns:
   - 0 for Adelie (short flipper, short culmen)
   - 1 for Chinstrap (short flipper, long culmen)
   - 2 for Gentoo (long flipper)
6. Also returns the list of node results

The thresholds (205mm for flipper length and 45mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that distinguish these penguin species.
