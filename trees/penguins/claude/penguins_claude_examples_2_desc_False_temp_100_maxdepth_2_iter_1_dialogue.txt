Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the instructions you've given, here's the Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier:

1. It first checks if the flipper length is less than or equal to 205 mm.
2. If it is, it then checks if the culmen length is less than or equal to 45 mm.
3. Based on these conditions, it predicts the penguin species:
   - If flipper length <= 205 mm and culmen length <= 45 mm, it predicts Adelie (0)
   - If flipper length <= 205 mm and culmen length > 45 mm, it predicts Chinstrap (1)
   - If flipper length > 205 mm, it predicts Gentoo (2)

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The predicted species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo)
2. A list of two boolean values representing the truth values of the two inner nodes

This function adheres to the feature names you provided and uses the species encoding you specified (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo). The thresholds (205 mm for flipper length and 45 mm for culmen length) are meaningful values based on typical measurements for these penguin species.
