Based on the penguin classification problem and the provided feature descriptions, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that returns both the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and the list of node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the most discriminative features
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4200
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth <= 17.0
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # body_mass <= 4200
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. Uses the most important features for penguin species classification
2. Has meaningful threshold values based on the typical measurements of different penguin species
3. Returns both the predicted species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and the list of boolean values for each node condition
4. Follows the exact feature names as provided
5. Has a maximum depth of 4
6. Uses mainly physical measurements which are the most reliable predictors of penguin species

The primary split on flipper length effectively separates Gentoo penguins (which are generally larger) from the others. The subsequent splits on culmen length, culmen depth, and body mass help distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins
