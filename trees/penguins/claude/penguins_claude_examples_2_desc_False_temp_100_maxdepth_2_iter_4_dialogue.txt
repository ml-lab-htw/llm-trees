Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the results (True/False) in `nodes`.
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. Returns the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds (205.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species. These values provide a reasonable split between the species, but they could be fine-tuned with more detailed data analysis.
