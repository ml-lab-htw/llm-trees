    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45

                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        if X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 50:  # Using culmen length for the larger flipper group
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap (potential outlier)
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable thresholds based on general penguin characteristics (e.g., flipper length of 200mm to distinguish Gentoo, culmen length of 45mm to distinguish Adelie and Chinstrap).  These would be refined with real data.
* **Island Encoding:** I've assumed the `island` feature is numerically encoded as 0, 1, and 2 as provided (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen). The tree directly checks for `X["island"] == 2` for Torgersen.
* **Simplified Structure:** I slightly simplified the tree structure based on the hypothetical tree presented earlier, keeping the most important distinguishing features.
* **List Comprehension for Node Values:** The `nodes` list is now created using a list comprehension that converts the boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) and handles potential `None` values (if any part of the tree isn't reached for a given input).
* **Comments:**  Added comments for clarity.

**How to Use:**

```python
example_penguin = {
    'island': 2, #Torgersen
    'culmen_length_mm': 39,
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18, #Not used in this simplified tree
    'flipper_length_mm': 181,
    'body_mass_g': 3750, #Not used in this simplified tree
    'sex': 2 #Male. Not used in this simplified tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_penguin)
print(f"Predicted Species (0=Adelie, 1=Chinstrap, 2=Gentoo): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

This will output the predicted species and a list of the truth values for the conditions at each inner node.


This function is designed to work directly with the specified feature names and encodings.  You would need to adapt it if your dataset uses different encodings or feature names.  Remember that this hypothetical tree will perform better with real-world data and training. Using a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) on a real dataset is the recommended approach for a robust and accurate model.
