Based on the provided format and feature specifications, here's the decision tree classifier function for penguin species prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store boolean values of conditions
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.5
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.3
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 15.7
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.2
    nodes[4] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 213.0

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 206.5
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 42.3
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth_mm <= 15.7
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206.5
        if nodes[3]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.2
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 213.0
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Uses the exact feature names as specified
- Returns both the prediction (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and the list of boolean values for each node condition
- Uses realistic threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- Has a maximum depth of 5
- Uses the most important features for classification (flipper length, culmen length, and culmen depth)

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
