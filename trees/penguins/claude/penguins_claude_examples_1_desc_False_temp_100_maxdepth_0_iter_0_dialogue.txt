Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45

    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node conditions
- Uses realistic threshold values:
  - 205mm for flipper length (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
  - 45mm for culmen length (to differentiate between Adelie and Chinstrap)
- Follows the same tree structure as previously described but formatted as a Python function
- Returns the node conditions as a list of boolean values (True/False converted to 1/0 when used)
