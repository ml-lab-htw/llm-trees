Based on the provided decision tree and feature specifications, I'll create a Python function that implements the penguin species classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: flipper length check
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    
    # Second level: culmen length check
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Third level: culmen depth check
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 15.0
    
    # Fourth level: second culmen length check
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 47.0
    
    # Fifth level: not used in this tree but included for completeness
    nodes[4] = False  # placeholder
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length > 45.0
            if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth <= 15.0
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:  # culmen_depth > 15.0
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length > 207.0
        if nodes[3]:  # culmen_length <= 47.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # culmen_length > 47.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - The predicted penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
  - A list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each node's condition
- Uses the exact feature names as specified
- Implements the decision tree logic based on the physical measurements
- Uses meaningful threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- Has
