Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specified format, here's the Python function that implements the penguin species classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # We have 4 decision nodes in our tree
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 15.5
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4750
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 207.0
        if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth_mm <= 15.5
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # body_mass_g <= 4750
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Uses 4 decision nodes based on the most important physical measurements
- Returns both the predicted penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and the list of boolean values for each decision node
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Implements the decision tree structure I described earlier with specific threshold values
- Maintains the correct target value encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)

The thresholds used are based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- 207.0 mm for flipper length (distinguishes Gentoo from others)
- 45.0 mm for culmen length (distinguishes
