Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the additional information you've given, I'll create a Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` with 2 elements (since we have a depth-2 tree with 2 decision nodes).
2. The first node checks if the flipper length is less than or equal to 205.0 mm.
3. The second node checks if the culmen length is less than or equal to 45.0 mm.
4. Based on these conditions, it predicts the penguin species:
   - If flipper length <= 205.0 mm and culmen length <= 45.0 mm: Adelie (0)
   - If flipper length <= 205.0 mm and culmen length > 45.0 mm: Chinstrap (1)
   - If flipper length > 205.0 mm: Gentoo (2)
5. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the feature names you provided and uses the correct encoding for the target variable (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo). The thresholds (205.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species.
