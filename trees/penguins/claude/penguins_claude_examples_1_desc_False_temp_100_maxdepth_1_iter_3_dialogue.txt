Based on the penguin classification problem and the decision tree I proposed earlier, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values as input
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the single decision node
3. Evaluates whether the flipper length is <= 207.0 mm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (Adelie) if flipper length <= 207.0 mm, 2 (Gentoo) if > 207.0 mm
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition (flipper_length_mm <= 207.0)

The threshold of 207.0 mm was chosen because:
- Adelie penguins typically have flipper lengths between 180-205 mm
- Gentoo penguins typically have flipper lengths between 215-230 mm
- 207 mm serves as a reasonable separation point between these two species

Note: This simple tree might not perfectly classify Chinstrap penguins (class 1), as it focuses on the primary distinction between Adelie and Gentoo penguins.
