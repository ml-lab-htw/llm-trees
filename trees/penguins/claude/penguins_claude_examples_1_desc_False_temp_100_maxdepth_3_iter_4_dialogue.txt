Based on the provided penguin features and encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on flipper length
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    # Second split on culmen length
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Third split (placeholder, as our tree only needs two splits)
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0  # This node won't be used in classification
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes (to maintain the required structure, even though we only need 2)
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds used are:
- flipper_length_mm: 206.0 mm (primary split to identify Gentoo penguins)
- culmen_length_mm: 45.0 mm (secondary split to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap)
- culmen_depth_mm: 17.0 mm (placeholder split that isn't used in classification)

These thresholds are based on typical measurements for these penguin species, where Gentoo penguins are notably larger than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins, and Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen than Adelie penguins.
