Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree classifier function using flipper_length_mm as the splitting criterion with a threshold of 207mm:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' of length 1 (as we have a depth-1 tree)
3. Sets the node value based on whether flipper_length_mm is <= 207mm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (Adelie) if flipper_length_mm <= 207mm, 2 (Gentoo) otherwise
   - nodes: list containing the boolean result of the splitting condition

The threshold of 207mm was chosen because:
- Gentoo penguins typically have flipper lengths greater than 207mm
- Adelie and Chinstrap penguins typically have flipper lengths less than 207mm
- This provides a good separation between Gentoo (2) and the other species, with Adelie (0) being the more common of the remaining species

Note: This simple tree will classify all penguins with flipper length <= 207mm as Adelie (0) and all others as Gentoo (2). Chinstrap penguins (1) are not explicitly identified in this depth-1 tree.
