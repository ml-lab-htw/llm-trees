Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # We have 2 decision nodes
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length_mm > 45
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node
4. Uses meaningful threshold values based on penguin biology:
   - 205mm for flipper length (distinguishes Gentoo from others)
   - 45mm for culmen length (distinguishes Adelie from Chinstrap)

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both:
- The predicted penguin species (0, 1, or 2)
- A list of boolean values indicating whether each condition in the decision nodes was met
