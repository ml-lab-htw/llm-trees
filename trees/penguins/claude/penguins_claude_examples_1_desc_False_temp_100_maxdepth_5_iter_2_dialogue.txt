I'll create a Python function for the penguin species classification based on the decision tree I provided earlier, adapting it to the exact feature names and encoding you specified:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4200
    nodes[4] = X["culmen_length_mm"] > 47.0

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth <= 17.0
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # culmen_length > 45.0
            if nodes[3]:  # body_mass <= 4200
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length > 205.0
        if nodes[4]:  # culmen_length > 47.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
- Has a maximum depth of 5
- Uses the most important morphological features for classification
- Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- Maintains reasonable threshold values based on typical penguin measurements

The decision tree primarily uses flipper length, culmen length, culmen depth, and body mass as these are the most reliable
