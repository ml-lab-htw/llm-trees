**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding:** The code now explicitly uses the provided integer encoding for `island` (0, 1, 2) and the species (0, 1, 2).
* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on general penguin characteristics.  For a real-world application, these thresholds should be learned from data using a decision tree algorithm.
* **Structure:** The `if/elif/else` structure reflects the hypothetical decision tree logic.
* **Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean truth values (True/False) of each decision node.  These are converted to 1/0 by any evaluation system that utilizes this code.
* **Missing Data Handling:** There is no explicit handling of missing data (NaN values) in this simplified example. In a real application, you'd need to implement strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation or special branches in the tree.




This improved function provides a clearer implementation of the decision tree logic, ready to be tested or integrated into a larger system.  Remember that the accuracy and effectiveness of this tree heavily depend on the quality and representativeness of the data used to determine the thresholds in a real-world scenario.
