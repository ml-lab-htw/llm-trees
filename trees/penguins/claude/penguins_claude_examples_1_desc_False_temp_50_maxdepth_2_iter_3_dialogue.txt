Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses flipper_length_mm and culmen_length_mm as the main features, with appropriate thresholds for penguin species classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. First checks if flipper length is <= 205mm (node[0])
4. For shorter flippers, checks if culmen length is <= 45mm (node[1])
5. Returns:
   - 0 for Adelie (short flipper, short culmen)
   - 1 for Chinstrap (short flipper, long culmen)
   - 2 for Gentoo (long flipper)
6. Also returns the list of node conditions (True/False values)

The thresholds (205mm for flipper length and 45mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that distinguish between these penguin species.
