Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses flipper length and culmen length as the main discriminating features, with appropriate threshold values for penguin classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X containing feature values
- Uses realistic threshold values:
  - 205mm for flipper length (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
  - 45mm for culmen length (to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap)
- Returns:
  - prediction: 0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo
  - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met
- Follows the exact feature names provided
- Uses the specified encoding for species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
