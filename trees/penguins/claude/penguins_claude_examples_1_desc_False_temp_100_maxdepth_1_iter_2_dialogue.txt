Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the penguin species classification using a decision tree of depth 1 with flipper length as the decisive feature.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the decision condition
3. Evaluates if flipper_length_mm is <= 207.0 mm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (Adelie) if flipper_length_mm <= 207.0, 2 (Gentoo) if > 207.0
   - nodes: list containing the boolean result of the condition

The threshold of 207.0 mm for flipper length is chosen because:
- Gentoo penguins typically have flipper lengths ranging from 208-234 mm
- Adelie and Chinstrap penguins typically have flipper lengths ranging from 172-203 mm
- This threshold provides a reasonable separation between Gentoo and the other species

Note: While this simple tree cannot perfectly distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins (both would be classified as Adelie), it provides a good first-level split for separating Gentoo from the other species.
