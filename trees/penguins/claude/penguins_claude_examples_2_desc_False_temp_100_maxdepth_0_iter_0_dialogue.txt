def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200  # Split 1: Flipper length
    nodes[1] = X["island"] == 2 # Split 2: Island (Torgersen)
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45 # Split 3: Culmen length
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 50  # Split 4: Culmen length (for larger flippers)



    if nodes[0]:  # Flipper length <= 200
        if nodes[1]:  # Island is Torgersen
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # Island is Biscoe or Dream
            if nodes[2]: #culmen length <= 45
                prediction = 0 # Adelie
            else: #culmen length > 45
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # Flipper length > 200
        if nodes[3]: #culmen length <= 50
            prediction = 0 # Adelie
        else: # culmen length > 50
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Values:** I've added reasonable threshold values (200mm for flipper length, 45mm and 50 mm for culmen length) based on general knowledge of penguin sizes.  These would need to be optimized with real data.
* **Island Encoding:**  I use the provided encoding (0=Biscoe, 1=Dream, 2=Torgersen) and specifically check for `X["island"] == 2` for Torgersen.
* **Simplified Structure:** I've simplified the tree structure a bit compared to the initial hypothetical version, merging some conditions to make it more compact and efficient. The logic remains largely the same.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list correctly tracks the truth value (True/False, which Python treats as 1/0 in a numerical context) of each decision node.


**Example Usage:**

```python
penguin1 = {
    'island': 0, 
    'culmen_length_mm': 39.1, 
    'culmen_depth_mm': 18.7, 
    'flipper_length_mm': 181, 
    'body_mass_g': 3750, 
    'sex': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(penguin1)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Should be Adelie (0)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") 
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output. Remember that this tree is still a hypothetical example. A real-world application would involve training a decision tree model on the actual Palmer Penguins dataset.  Using a library like scikit-learn is highly recommended for that.
