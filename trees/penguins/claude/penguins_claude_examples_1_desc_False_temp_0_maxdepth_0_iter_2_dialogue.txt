Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses two decision nodes based on `flipper_length_mm` and `culmen_length_mm`
2. Returns predictions encoded as:
   - 0 for Adelie
   - 1 for Chinstrap
   - 2 for Gentoo
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each decision node

The thresholds (205.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that help distinguish between the three penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (> 205 mm)
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen (> 45 mm) compared to Adelie penguins
