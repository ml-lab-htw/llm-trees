Based on the penguin dataset information provided, I'll create a prediction function using flipper length as the main splitting criterion, with a threshold of 205mm to distinguish Gentoo penguins (species=2) from others.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (since depth=1)
3. Sets the node value based on whether flipper_length_mm is <= 205.0
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (Adelie) if flipper_length_mm <= 205.0, 2 (Gentoo) if > 205.0
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition (flipper_length_mm <= 205.0)

Note: This simplified model mainly distinguishes between Adelie (0) and Gentoo (2) penguins. It might not accurately classify Chinstrap penguins (1), but this is the limitation of using a depth-1 decision tree.
