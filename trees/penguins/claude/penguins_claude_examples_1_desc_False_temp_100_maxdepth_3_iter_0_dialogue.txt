Based on the provided penguin dataset information and feature descriptions, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, using the correct feature names and encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on flipper length
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    # Second split on culmen length
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Third split (though not used in this simple tree, included for consistency)
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0  
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
- Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for the node conditions
- Uses meaningful threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- Has a maximum depth of 3
- Primarily uses flipper_length_mm and culmen_length_mm as the main discriminative features
- Includes a third node condition (culmen_depth_mm) to maintain the required structure, though it's not used in the actual classification

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements:
- 206.0 mm for flipper length effectively separates Gentoo penguins (typically larger) from others
- 45.0 mm for culmen length helps distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins
- 17.0 mm for culmen depth is included as the third node condition, though not used in the final classification
