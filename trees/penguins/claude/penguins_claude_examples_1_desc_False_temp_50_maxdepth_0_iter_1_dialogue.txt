Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # We have 2 decision nodes
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length_mm > 45.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the feature names exactly as provided
2. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
3. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the state of each decision node

The thresholds used (205.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that distinguish between these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (>205 mm)
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths than Adelie penguins

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns a tuple containing:
1. The predicted class (0, 1, or 2)
2. A list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0)
