Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Is the flipper length <= 205 mm?
   - Node 1: Is the culmen length <= 45 mm?
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. Returns the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds (205 mm for flipper length and 45 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species, but they might need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset being used.
