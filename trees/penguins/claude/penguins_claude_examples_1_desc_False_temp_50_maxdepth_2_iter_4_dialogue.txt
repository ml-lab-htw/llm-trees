Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, here's the decision tree classifier implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions for flipper length and culmen length
4. Returns both the predicted species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node results

The thresholds (206.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical morphological differences between these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (>206 mm)
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths than Adelie penguins
