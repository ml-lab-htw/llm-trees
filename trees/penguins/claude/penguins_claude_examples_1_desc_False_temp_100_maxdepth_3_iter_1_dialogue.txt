Based on the provided decision tree and feature specifications, here's the Python function that implements the classification and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing conditions
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # We only have 2 inner nodes in our tree
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
- Uses the two most important features: flipper_length_mm and culmen_length_mm
- Has thresholds based on typical measurements for these penguin species
- Returns both the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- The nodes list contains True/False values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds (206.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that help distinguish between these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have flipper lengths > 206 mm
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths than Adelie penguins
