Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses flipper_length_mm and culmen_length_mm as the main features, with appropriate thresholds for penguin species classification.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
2. First node checks if flipper length is <= 206.0 mm
3. Second node checks if culmen length is <= 45.0 mm
4. Returns both the predicted penguin species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node truth values

The thresholds (206.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical morphological differences between these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (> 206 mm)
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths than Adelie penguins
