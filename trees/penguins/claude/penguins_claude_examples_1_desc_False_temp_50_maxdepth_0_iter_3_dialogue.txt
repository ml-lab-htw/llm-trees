Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
3. Uses two key features with meaningful thresholds:
   - flipper_length_mm with threshold 205.0 mm
   - culmen_length_mm with threshold 45.0 mm
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the condition results at each node

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (>205mm)
- Among the smaller flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths (>45mm) compared to Adelie penguins

This implementation maintains simplicity while capturing the key distinguishing features of the different penguin species.
