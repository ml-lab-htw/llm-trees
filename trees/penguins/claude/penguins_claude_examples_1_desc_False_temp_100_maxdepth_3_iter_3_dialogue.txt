Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses flipper length and culmen length as the main discriminative features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on flipper length
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    
    # Second split on culmen length for smaller flipper lengths
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Third node (included for completeness but not used in this tree)
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 15.0  # This node isn't actually used
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length > 45.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 207.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
- Returns a list of boolean values for each node condition
- Uses meaningful threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- Maintains a maximum depth of 3

The decision logic:
1. First checks if flipper length is ≤ 207mm
2. For smaller flipper lengths, checks if culmen length is ≤ 45mm
3. The third node is included in the nodes list but isn't used in the actual decision making (included for consistency with the required format)

The thresholds are chosen based on typical measurements that separate these species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (>207mm)
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Adelie typically have shorter culmen lengths compared to Chinstrap
