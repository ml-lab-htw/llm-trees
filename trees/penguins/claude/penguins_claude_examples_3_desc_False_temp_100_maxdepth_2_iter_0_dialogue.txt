Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specifications you've provided, here's the Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the results (True/False) in the `nodes` list.
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.
5. Returns the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used (205 for flipper length and 45 for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species. These values provide a reasonable separation between the species based on their physical characteristics.

Note that this function uses only two of the provided features (`flipper_length_mm` and `culmen_length_mm`) as they were determined to be the most important for classification in this simplified model. The other features (island, culmen_depth_mm, body_mass_g, and sex) are not used in this particular decision tree.
