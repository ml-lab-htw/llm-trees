Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the two decision nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses two key features: `flipper_length_mm` and `culmen_length_mm`
2. Returns both the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node conditions
3. Uses meaningful threshold values based on penguin biology:
   - 205.0 mm for flipper length (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
   - 45.0 mm for culmen length (to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap)
4. Follows the exact feature naming convention provided
5. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns a tuple containing:
1. The predicted penguin species (0, 1, or 2)
2. A list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the internal nodes was met
