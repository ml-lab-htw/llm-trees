Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Uses flipper_length_mm as the primary split (threshold 206.0 mm)
4. Uses culmen_length_mm as the secondary split (threshold 45.0 mm)
5. Returns both the predicted class (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (206.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that distinguish between these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have flipper lengths > 206 mm
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths than Adelie penguins, with the split around 45 mm
