Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using flipper length and culmen length as the main features, with realistic threshold values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds I chose (206.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (>206 mm)
- Among the smaller-flippered penguins, Adelie penguins typically have shorter culmen length (â‰¤45 mm) compared to Chinstrap penguins

The function returns:
- prediction: 0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo
- nodes: a list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met in the decision tree
