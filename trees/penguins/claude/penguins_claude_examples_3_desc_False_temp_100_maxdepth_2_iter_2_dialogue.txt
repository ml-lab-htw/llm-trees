Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that predicts the penguin species and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values for a penguin.
2. It creates a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as we have 2 inner nodes in our depth-2 tree).
3. The first node checks if the flipper length is <= 205 mm.
4. The second node checks if the culmen length is <= 45 mm (only relevant if the first condition is true).
5. Based on these conditions, it predicts the penguin species:
   - 0 for Adelie
   - 1 for Chinstrap
   - 2 for Gentoo
6. It returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds (205 mm for flipper length and 45 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species. These values provide a reasonable split between the species based on their physical characteristics.
