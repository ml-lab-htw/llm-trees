Based on the provided feature names and encodings, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
- Uses realistic threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- The first node splits on flipper length at 205.0 mm (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
- The second node splits on culmen length at 45.0 mm (Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen than Adelie)
- Follows the specified format for the function

The thresholds chosen (205.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that help distinguish between these penguin species.
