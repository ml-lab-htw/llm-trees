Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the guidelines you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for penguin species:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values for a single penguin.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Is the flipper length <= 205 mm?
   - Node 1: Is the culmen length <= 45 mm?
4. Based on these conditions, it predicts the penguin species:
   - 0 for Adelie
   - 1 for Chinstrap
   - 2 for Gentoo
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds (205 mm for flipper length and 45 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species, but they might need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset being used.

This function maintains a maximum depth of 2 as requested and uses the feature names exactly as provided in the feature list. It focuses on the two most discriminative physical features (flipper length and culmen length) to classify the penguins.
