Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # We have 2 decision nodes
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node
4. Uses meaningful threshold values:
   - 205.0 mm for flipper length (distinguishes Gentoo from others)
   - 45.0 mm for culmen length (distinguishes Adelie from Chinstrap)

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both:
- The predicted penguin species (0, 1, or 2)
- A list of boolean values indicating whether each condition in the decision nodes was met

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species, where Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers (>205mm) and Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen lengths than Adelie penguins.
