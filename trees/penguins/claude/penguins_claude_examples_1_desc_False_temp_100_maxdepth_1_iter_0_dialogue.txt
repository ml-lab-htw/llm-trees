Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using flipper_length_mm as the main splitting feature with a threshold of 210mm.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 210
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 210
        prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 210
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (since depth=1)
3. Stores the boolean result of the condition (flipper_length_mm <= 210) in nodes[0]
4. Makes a prediction based on the condition:
   - If flipper length is <= 210mm, predicts Adelie (0)
   - If flipper length is > 210mm, predicts Gentoo (2)
5. Returns both the prediction and the nodes list

Note: While this simple tree mainly separates Gentoo from the others, it might sometimes misclassify Chinstrap penguins as Adelie since they have similar flipper lengths. A deeper tree would be needed for better separation of all three species.
