The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- Flipper length threshold at 205mm separates Gentoo (typically 215-230mm) from Adelie and Chinstrap (typically 190-200mm)
- Culmen length threshold at 45mm separates Adelie (typically 35-40mm) from Chinstrap (typically 45-50mm)

The function follows the encoding scheme:
- Species: 0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo
- Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for the decision nodes
