Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts penguin species (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and returns the node conditions. I'll use meaningful threshold values based on typical penguin measurements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level: Flipper length is a key distinguishing feature
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    # Second level: Culmen length helps distinguish Adelie from Chinstrap
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Third level: Body mass can help refine the classification
    nodes[2] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4200
    
    # Fourth level: Culmen depth for final refinement
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 18.0

    if nodes[0]:  # Flipper length <= 206mm
        if nodes[1]:  # Culmen length <= 45mm
            if nodes[2]:  # Body mass <= 4200g
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Adelie
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # Culmen length > 45mm
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # Flipper length > 206mm
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First splits on flipper length (main distinguishing feature between Gentoo and others)
2. Then uses culmen length to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap
3. Uses body mass as a third-level split
4. Finally uses culmen depth for fine-tuning

The thresholds are chosen based on typical measurements:
- Flipper length: 206mm (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
- Culmen length: 45
