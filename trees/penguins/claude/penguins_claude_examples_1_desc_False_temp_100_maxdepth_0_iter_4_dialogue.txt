Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and expected function format, here's the decision tree classifier function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 207.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the binary decisions at each node
3. Evaluates the conditions for flipper length and culmen length
4. Returns both:
   - The predicted species (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo)
   - A list of boolean values representing the decisions at each node

The thresholds (207.0 mm for flipper length and 45.0 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements that help distinguish between these penguin species.
