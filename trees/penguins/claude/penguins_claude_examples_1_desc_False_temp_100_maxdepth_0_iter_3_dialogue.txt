Based on the provided feature details and target encoding, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree for penguin species classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Flipper length threshold around 207mm (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207
    
    # Culmen length threshold around 45mm (helps distinguish Adelie from Chinstrap)
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 207mm
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45mm
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length > 45mm
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 207mm
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary X with feature names as keys
- Uses realistic threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- Returns both the predicted species (0: Adelie, 1: Chinstrap, 2: Gentoo) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
- Uses exactly the feature names provided
- Follows the decision tree structure previously described
- Uses interpretable threshold values that align with real penguin measurements

The thresholds (207mm for flipper length and 45mm for culmen length) are chosen based on typical measurements that help distinguish between these penguin species.
