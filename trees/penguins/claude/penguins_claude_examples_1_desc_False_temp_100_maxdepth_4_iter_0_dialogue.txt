Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function for penguin species classification. I'll use the structure from my previous tree but adjust it according to the specified format and feature names:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the decision nodes with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.5
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4200

    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 206
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45
            if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth_mm <= 17.5
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # body_mass_g <= 4200
                    prediction = 0  # Adelie
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
- Returns a tuple containing:
  1. The predicted class (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
  2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of each node condition

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- Flipper length threshold of 206mm separates Gentoo (typically larger) from others
- Culmen length threshold of 45mm helps distinguish between species
- Culmen depth threshold of 17.5mm helps separate Adelie from Chinstrap
- Body mass threshold of 4
