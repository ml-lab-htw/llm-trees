Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature specifications, here's the Python function that implements the classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level split on flipper length
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    
    # Second level split on culmen length
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.45
    
    # Third level split on culmen length for the right branch
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 47.0
    
    # Fourth level is not used in this tree but included for completeness
    nodes[3] = False  # Placeholder
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.45
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length_mm > 45.45
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 206.0
        if nodes[2]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 47.0
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
        else:  # culmen_length_mm > 47.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Returns a tuple containing:
  1. The predicted class (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
  2. A list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each node's condition
- Uses the most discriminative features (flipper_length_mm and culmen_length_mm)
- The thresholds (206.0, 45.45, and 47.0) are based on typical measurements that help distinguish between the species
- The fourth node is included as a placeholder to maintain the requested structure, although it's not used in the actual decision making

The logic follows the decision tree structure I provided earlier, where:
