Based on the penguin features and the specified format, here's the decision tree classifier function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Main decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 42.3
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 15.0
    nodes[3] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 47.0
    nodes[4] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 4500  # Additional split for depth completion
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 42.3
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length > 42.3
            if nodes[2]:  # culmen_depth <= 15.0
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:  # culmen_depth > 15.0
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
    else:  # flipper_length > 207.0
        if nodes[3]:  # culmen_length <= 47.0
            if nodes[4]:  # body_mass <= 4500
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            else:
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:  # culmen_length > 47.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Returns both the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and the list of node conditions
- Uses the exact feature names as specified
- Implements the decision tree structure we discussed earlier
- Has meaningful threshold values based on typical penguin measurements
- Has a maximum depth of 5
- Uses the most discriminative features (flipper length, culmen length, culmen depth, and body mass)

The thresholds are set to
