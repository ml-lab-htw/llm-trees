Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function for predicting penguin species:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:

1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Checks if flipper length is <= 205 mm
   - Node 1: Checks if culmen length is <= 45 mm
4. Uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction:
   - If flipper length <= 205 mm and culmen length <= 45 mm: Adelie (0)
   - If flipper length <= 205 mm and culmen length > 45 mm: Chinstrap (1)
   - If flipper length > 205 mm: Gentoo (2)
5. Returns the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds (205 mm for flipper length and 45 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species, but they might need to be fine-tuned with actual data for optimal performance.
