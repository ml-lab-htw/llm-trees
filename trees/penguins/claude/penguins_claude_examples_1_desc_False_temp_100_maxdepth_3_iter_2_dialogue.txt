Based on the provided penguin dataset information, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the most important features and returns both the prediction and the node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (using the thresholds from the previous tree)
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_depth_mm"] <= 17.0  # Added third split for completeness
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature names as provided in the dataset
2. Implements the decision tree structure we discussed earlier
3. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
4. Returns a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each node's condition

The thresholds are based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- Flipper length of 206mm effectively separates Gentoo penguins (typically larger) from others
- Culmen length of 45mm helps distinguish between Adelie (typically shorter) and Chinstrap (typically longer)
- Added a third node for completeness, though it might not be used in all paths

The function takes a dictionary containing the feature values and returns both:
1. The predicted class (0, 1, or 2)
2. A list of three boolean values indicating whether each condition was met
