    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 200
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    nodes[2] = X["island"] == 2  # Torgersen (encoded as 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # Biscoe or Dream
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 0  # Adelie
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 200
        if X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 50:  # Adjust threshold as needed
            prediction = 0 # Adelie (potential outlier)
        else:
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on the general characteristics of penguins.  For example, Gentoo penguins tend to have flippers longer than 200mm.  These thresholds would be optimized during training with real data.
* **Island Encoding:** I directly used the encoding provided (0 = Biscoe, 1 = Dream, 2 = Torgersen) for the `island` feature.
* **Simplified Structure:**  I've slightly simplified the tree structure to reflect a more likely hierarchy based on the provided features and general penguin characteristics.  This also helps avoid unnecessary nesting.
* **Outlier Handling:** A check for large Adelie penguins (those with flipper length > 200mm but smaller culmen length) has been included.  This acknowledges potential outliers in a real-world dataset.
* **Clearer Node Conditions:**  I've used more descriptive comments to indicate which branch corresponds to which condition.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    "island": 0,  # Biscoe
    "culmen_length_mm": 39,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18,
    "flipper_length_mm": 181,
    "body_mass_g": 3750,
    "sex": 2  # Male
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 0 (Adelie)
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}") # Output: Node conditions: [True, True, False]

X = {
    "island": 1, # Dream
    "culmen_length_mm": 48,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 16,
    "flipper_length_mm": 190,
    "body_mass_g": 3800,
    "sex": 1 # Female
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 1 (Chinstrap)
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}") # Output: Node conditions: [True, False, False]



X = {
    "island": 2, # Torgersen
    "culmen_length_mm": 55,
    "culmen_depth_mm": 18,
    "flipper_length_mm": 220,
    "body_mass_g": 5500,
    "sex": 1 # Female
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted species: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted species: 2 (Gentoo)
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}") # Output: Node conditions: [False, False, True]
```



This function now provides both the prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes, making it more interpretable and useful for understanding the decision-making process. Remember, to create a truly effective model, you would train this structure using a real penguin dataset and a decision tree learning algorithm.
