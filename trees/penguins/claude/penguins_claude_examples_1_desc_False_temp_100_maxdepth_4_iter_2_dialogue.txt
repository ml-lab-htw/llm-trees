Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specified feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level: flipper length check
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    
    # Second level: culmen length check
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.5
    
    # Third level: culmen length check for larger flippers
    nodes[2] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 55.0
    
    # Fourth level: body mass check
    nodes[3] = X["body_mass_g"] <= 5200.0

    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.5
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:  # culmen_length > 45.5
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 207.0
        if nodes[2]:  # culmen_length <= 55.0
            if nodes[3]:  # body_mass <= 5200.0
                prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
            else:  # body_mass > 5200.0
                prediction = 2  # Gentoo
        else:  # culmen_length > 55.0
            prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
- Creates a list of 4 nodes to store the binary decisions
- Uses the thresholds from the decision tree to make classification decisions
- Returns both the predicted class (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo) and the list of node decisions

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species:
- Flipper length of 207mm separates Gentoo (typically larger) from other species
- Culmen length of 45.5mm helps separate
