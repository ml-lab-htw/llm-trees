Based on the given information and examples, I'll create a Python function for the penguin species classification decision tree. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.
2. Creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Checks if flipper length is <= 205 mm
   - Node 1: Checks if culmen length is <= 45 mm (only evaluated if node 0 is True)
4. Based on these conditions, it predicts the penguin species:
   - 0 for Adelie
   - 1 for Chinstrap
   - 2 for Gentoo
5. Returns the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds (205 mm for flipper length and 45 mm for culmen length) are based on typical measurements for these penguin species, but they might need to be adjusted based on the specific dataset.

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, uses the most likely important features (flipper length and culmen length), and follows the format of the examples provided.
