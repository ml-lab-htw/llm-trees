Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function for penguin species classification. I'll use the most discriminative features with meaningful thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # We have 2 decision nodes
    
    # Decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 207.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 207.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses two key features: flipper_length_mm and culmen_length_mm
2. Returns both the prediction (0 for Adelie, 1 for Chinstrap, 2 for Gentoo) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
3. Uses meaningful threshold values based on penguin biology:
   - 207.0 mm for flipper length (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
   - 45.0 mm for culmen length (Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen than Adelie)
4. Follows the exact feature names as provided in the feature list
5. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)

The decision tree first checks the flipper length, and if it's greater than 207mm, it classifies the penguin as Gentoo. For smaller flipper lengths, it uses the culmen length to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap penguins.
