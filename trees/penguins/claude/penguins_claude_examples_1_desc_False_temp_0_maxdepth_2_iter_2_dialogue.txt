Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 206.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length <= 206.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length > 206.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Returns species predictions encoded as 0 (Adelie), 1 (Chinstrap), and 2 (Gentoo)
3. Uses meaningful threshold values:
   - 206.0 mm for flipper length (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
   - 45.0 mm for culmen length (Chinstrap penguins typically have longer culmen than Adelie)
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node

The function takes a dictionary X containing the feature values and returns a tuple containing:
1. The predicted species (0, 1, or 2)
2. A list of two boolean values indicating whether each condition was satisfied

The thresholds were chosen based on typical measurements for these penguin species, where Gentoo penguins are generally larger with longer flippers, and among the smaller penguins, Chinstrap typically have longer culmen than Adelie.
