Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the two decision nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["flipper_length_mm"] <= 205.0
    nodes[1] = X["culmen_length_mm"] <= 45.0
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # flipper_length_mm <= 205.0
        if nodes[1]:  # culmen_length_mm <= 45.0
            prediction = 0  # Adelie
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Chinstrap
    else:  # flipper_length_mm > 205.0
        prediction = 2  # Gentoo
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses two decision nodes based on flipper length and culmen length
2. Returns predictions using the correct encoding (0 = Adelie, 1 = Chinstrap, 2 = Gentoo)
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each decision node
4. Uses the exact feature names as provided in the keys
5. Uses meaningful threshold values based on typical penguin measurements:
   - 205.0 mm for flipper length (Gentoo penguins typically have longer flippers)
   - 45.0 mm for culmen length (to distinguish between Adelie and Chinstrap)

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both the predicted class (0, 1, or 2) and a list of boolean values representing the decision path through the tree.
