**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable thresholds (4.5 for average wage increase) based on the provided ranges. These would ideally be learned from data.

2. **Encoding Categorical Features:**  The code now handles the categorical variables `cost of living adjustment` and `contribution to health plan` by mapping them to numerical values (0 or 1) using dictionaries. This allows for easier comparison in the decision tree.

3. **Average Wage Increase:**  The function calculates the average wage increase across the three years, as outlined in the hypothetical tree.

4. **Clearer Logic:** The `if` statements are more organized, mirroring the structure of the decision tree and making the logic easier to follow.

5. **Example Usage:**  I've included an example `example_features` dictionary to demonstrate how to use the function.  Remember to replace these with your real data.


**Key Points for Real-World Application:**

* **Data is Essential:** This hypothetical tree and the Python function are just illustrations.  To get accurate predictions, you *must* train a real decision tree classifier on a dataset of past labor negotiations.
* **Scikit-learn:** Use a library like scikit-learn to create and train decision tree models. This will handle feature selection, threshold optimization, and model evaluation automatically.  Don't try to build complex decision trees manually.
* **Feature Engineering:**  Consider other ways to combine or transform the features (e.g., ratios, differences between years, etc.) to improve model performance.
* **Model Evaluation:**  Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to evaluate the performance of your trained model and choose the best model for your needs.
