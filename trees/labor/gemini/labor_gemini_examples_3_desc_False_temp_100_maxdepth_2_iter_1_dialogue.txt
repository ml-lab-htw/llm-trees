Okay, I understand now. You want a Python function that represents a decision tree for predicting labor negotiation outcomes, returning both the prediction and the truth values of the nodes. 

**Important:** Without real data, I'm making assumptions about good thresholds for the features. These are for illustration only!

```python
def predict_labor_outcome(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0: bad, 1: good) 
               and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None] 

    # Node 1: Wage increase in the first year 
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 4.0 

    # Node 2: Employer contributions to the pension plan
    nodes[1] = X['pension'] != 'none'

    # Node 3: Duration of agreement (only evaluated if Node 1 is False)
    nodes[2] = X['duration'] > 3 

    if nodes[0]: 
        # Good wage increase, likely good outcome
        prediction = 1 
    else:
        if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:
            # Even with lower wage increase, pension and longer duration are good signs
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_negotiation = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 2.5,
    'wage increase third year': 2.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'ret_allw',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 8,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 11,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': False,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, node_values = predict_labor_outcome(example_negotiation)
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {node_values}") 
```

**Explanation:**

* **`predict_labor_outcome(X)`:** Takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a labor negotiation.
* **`nodes`:**  A list to store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node of our decision tree.
* **Node 1:**  Checks if the "wage increase first year" is greater than 4.0. A higher initial wage increase is a strong indicator of a good outcome.
* **Node 2:** Checks if there are "pension" contributions from the employer (not equal to 'none').  
* **Node 3:** Checks if the "duration" of the agreement is greater than 3 years. This node is only evaluated if Node 1 is False (meaning the wage increase was not high).
* **Prediction Logic:** The code then uses the truth values of the nodes to arrive at a prediction using if-else statements that represent the branches of the decision tree.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example and the thresholds (4.0 for wage increase, 3 for duration) are arbitrary. You'll need a labeled dataset of past labor negotiations to determine the most important features and the best thresholds for those features through a machine learning process.
