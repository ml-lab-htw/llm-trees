```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0


    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Good
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Good


    return prediction, nodes
```


This function mirrors the decision tree logic described previously. The threshold for the "wage increase first year" is set to 4.5 (midpoint of the range). The "contribution to health plan" is checked for being "none."  The nodes list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each level of the tree.  Remember, this function is based on assumed feature importance and hasn't been trained on actual data, so its predictive accuracy is unknown.  It serves as a template for how you would structure a decision tree prediction function in Python.
