**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  Numerical thresholds are now included for wage increase and agreement duration.  These are still hypothetical, but more illustrative than placeholders.
* **String Comparison:** The code correctly handles string values for features like 'cost of living adjustment' and 'contribution to health plan'.
* **Aligned with Feature Names:**  The code uses the exact feature names you provided.
* **Docstring:**  Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose and arguments.
* **Example Usage:** Included an example to demonstrate how to use the function.


Remember that this decision tree is still based on assumptions.  To build a truly effective model, you would need a dataset of past labor negotiations and use a machine learning library like scikit-learn.  The library would automatically determine the optimal tree structure, features, and thresholds based on your data.
