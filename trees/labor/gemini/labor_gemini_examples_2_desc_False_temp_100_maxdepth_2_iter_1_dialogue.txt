I can certainly help you with that!  

Since I don't have the actual data to determine the most important features and optimal thresholds, I'll create a decision tree based on reasonable assumptions. You can later refine this tree with your data and a machine learning algorithm.

Let's assume the following features are most important and use these thresholds for our decision tree:

* **`wage increase first year`**:  A strong indicator of negotiation outcome. Assume a first-year wage increase above 4.5 is generally associated with a "good" outcome.
* **`contribution to health plan`**: Comprehensive health plans are highly valued.  Assume "full" contribution indicates a "good" outcome, while other options may lead to a "bad" outcome.

Here's the Python function representing this decision tree:

```python
def predict_negotiation_outcome(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on key features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 0 for "bad" outcome, 1 for "good" outcome.
            nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1 if condition met, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize nodes list (maximum depth 2)

    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] > 4.5  # Condition for the root node
    if nodes[0]:
        # Branch 1: High wage increase in the first year 
        prediction = 1  # Assume good outcome 
    else:
        # Branch 2: Lower wage increase, check health plan contribution
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome with full health contribution
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome otherwise

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage:
example_negotiation = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 4.0,
    'wage increase third year': 4.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 8,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 11,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none' 
}

prediction, nodes = predict_negotiation_outcome(example_negotiation)
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_negotiation_outcome(X)`:** This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a single labor negotiation.
2. **`nodes`:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) resulting from the conditions at each inner node of the tree. In this case, we have a maximum of two inner nodes (depth 2).
3. **Root Node:** The first condition checks if the `wage increase first year` is greater than 4.5.  The result (`True` or `False`) is stored in `nodes[0]`.
4. **Branching:** The `if` and `else` blocks determine the path based on the outcome of the root node's condition. 
5. **Second Level Condition (if applicable):** If the first-year wage increase is not above 4.5, we further check the `contribution to health plan`. 
6. **Prediction:** Based on the path taken, a `prediction` of 0 (bad) or 1 (good) is made.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. In reality, you'd train a decision tree model on your dataset to determine the most relevant features and their optimal thresholds for splitting. You can then refine this function with more complex decision logic and thresholds discovered through the training process.
