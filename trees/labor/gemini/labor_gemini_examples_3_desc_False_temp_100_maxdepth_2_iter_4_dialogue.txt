**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   * `nodes = 2 * [None]`: Creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values of our decision nodes.

2. **Decision Node 1:**
   * `nodes[0] = float(X['wage increase first year']) <= 4.5`: This implements our first decision split. 
      * We access the value of the 'wage increase first year' feature from the input dictionary `X`. Since this is a numerical feature, we convert it to a float using `float()`.
      * We compare the wage increase to a threshold of 4.5.  **This threshold is a placeholder and needs to be determined based on your data analysis or domain knowledge.** 
      * The result of the comparison (`True` if wage increase is less than or equal to 4.5, `False` otherwise) is stored in `nodes[0]`.

3. **Decision Node 2:**
   * `nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc'`: This implements the second decision, branching from the "medium/high wage increase" path.
      * It checks if the 'cost of living adjustment' feature is equal to 'tc' (representing a "total compensation adjustment").
      * The result (`True` if the condition is met, `False` otherwise) is stored in `nodes[1]`.

4. **Prediction Logic:**
   * The `if-else` blocks determine the prediction based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.
   * A `prediction` of 0 represents a "bad" outcome, and 1 represents a "good" outcome.

5. **Return Values:**
   * The function returns a tuple: `(prediction, nodes)`
      * `prediction`:  The predicted outcome (0 or 1).
      * `nodes`: The list containing the truth values (True/False) for the decision nodes. This allows you to understand which path was taken in the decision tree. 

**Key Points:**

* **Thresholds:** The chosen threshold (4.5 for wage increase) is a significant factor influencing the tree's performance. You'll need to analyze your data or consult with domain experts to determine the most appropriate thresholds for each split.
* **Feature Importance:** This tree assumes 'wage increase first year' and 'cost of living adjustment' are the most important features. This assumption should be based on your data exploration and understanding of labor negotiations.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** The structure and thresholds of the decision tree should ideally be learned from a dataset of historical labor negotiation outcomes using a decision tree algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) rather than being hardcoded.
