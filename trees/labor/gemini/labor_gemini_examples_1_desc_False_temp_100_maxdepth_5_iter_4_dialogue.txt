Key Improvements:

* **Clear Thresholds:**  Numeric thresholds added to the decision nodes (e.g., `wage increase first year <= 3.0`).
* **String Comparisons:**  Correctly handles string values for categorical features (e.g., `"contribution to health plan" == 0`).
* **Python Function:**  Formatted as a Python function that takes a dictionary of features as input.
* **Nodes List:** Returns the list of truth values (0s and 1s) as requested.
* **Type Hinting:** Uses type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code readability and maintainability.
* **Example Usage:** Includes example usage to demonstrate how to call the function.


This improved version addresses the specific requirements of your prompt and provides a more practical and usable solution. Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* tree.  You *must* train a real decision tree using your data and a machine learning library for accurate predictions.
