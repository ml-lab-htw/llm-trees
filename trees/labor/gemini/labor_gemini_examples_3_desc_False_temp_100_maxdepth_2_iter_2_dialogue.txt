I can help you create that function.  Without the labeled labor negotiation data, I can't determine the *best* features or thresholds. However, I can create a template based on reasonable assumptions, which you can then refine once you have data to train the model.

```python
def predict_labor_outcome(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on given features.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the feature values for the negotiation.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - prediction: The predicted outcome (0 for bad, 1 for good).
      - nodes: A list representing the truth values of inner nodes (1 if true, 0 if false).
  """

  nodes = 2 * [None] 

  # Node 1: Wage increase in the first year 
  nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >= 4.0 

  # Node 2: Based on the 'cost of living adjustment'
  nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc' # Assuming 'tc' means a favorable adjustment

  # Decision logic based on the nodes
  if nodes[0]:  # If wage increase in the first year is significant
    if nodes[1]: # AND a favorable cost of living adjustment exists
      prediction = 1  # Predict a good outcome 
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Otherwise, predict a bad outcome
  else: # If the wage increase in the first year is NOT significant
    prediction = 0  # Predict a bad outcome 

  return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single labor negotiation, with keys being the feature names you provided.
2. **Nodes:** The `nodes` list stores whether each node's condition is met (1 for true, 0 for false). This helps you understand the decision path.
3. **Placeholder Logic:** I've used these features as potentially important ones:
   - **`wage increase first year`:**  A higher initial increase might suggest a smoother negotiation.
   - **`cost of living adjustment`:**  A strong cost of living adjustment likely leads to a better outcome for workers.
4. **Thresholds:** The values `4.0` (for wage increase) and `'tc'` (for cost of living adjustment) are placeholders. You'll need to analyze your data to find more meaningful thresholds that separate good and bad outcomes effectively.

**How to use this function:**

```python
negotiation_example = {
  'duration': 3,
  'wage increase first year': 5.5, 
  'wage increase second year': 3.0,
  # ... (rest of the features)
  'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
  # ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict_labor_outcome(negotiation_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0=bad, 1=good)")
print(f"Nodes (truth values): {nodes}")
```

**Important:** This is a highly simplified example. With real data, you'd likely use more features, different thresholds, and potentially a deeper tree. You'd also need to evaluate the tree's performance and adjust it accordingly.
