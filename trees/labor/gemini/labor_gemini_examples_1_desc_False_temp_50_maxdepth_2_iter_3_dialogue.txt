**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Thresholds:** Meaningful thresholds are now included (4.5 for first-year wage increase). These values, in a real application, would be learned from training data.
* **Feature Encoding Handling:**  The code directly uses the string values for the `cost of living adjustment` and `contribution to health plan` features, matching the provided encoding.
* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.
* **Example Usage:** Added example usage to demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the output.
* **Adherence to Prompt:**  The function signature, return values, and overall structure strictly adhere to the prompt's requirements.

This improved version provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree and demonstrates how to use it with sample data. Remember that the effectiveness of this tree depends heavily on the chosen thresholds and the initial assumptions about feature importance.  In a real application, training with data is crucial.
