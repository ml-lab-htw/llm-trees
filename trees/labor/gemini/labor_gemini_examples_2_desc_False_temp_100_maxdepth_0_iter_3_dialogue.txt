def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] != 'none'
    nodes[2] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'none'
    nodes[3] = X['duration'] <= 3

    if nodes[0]:  # Low first-year wage increase
        if nodes[1]:  # COLA present
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:  # No COLA
            prediction = 0  # Bad
    else:  # Higher first-year wage increase
        if nodes[2]:  # No health plan contribution
            if nodes[3]:  # Short duration
                prediction = 0  # Bad
            else:  # Longer duration
                prediction = 1  # Good
        else:  # Health plan contribution present
            prediction = 1  # Good


    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The provided encoding for categorical features like `cost of living adjustment` and `contribution to health plan` is used directly for comparison.
* **Thresholds:**  Reasonable threshold values are selected based on the description and hypothetical tree. For example, a 4.0 wage increase in the first year is used as a splitting point. These would ideally be learned from a training dataset.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The tree structure is simplified slightly from the original hypothetical example to make it more concise and readable while keeping the core logic.  In a real-world scenario, the tree structure would be determined by a decision tree learning algorithm based on training data.
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (0 for "bad," 1 for "good") and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision nodes.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'duration': 2,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none' 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

This example would result in a prediction of `0` (bad) and `nodes = [True, False, True, True]`.


This function now accurately represents the provided hypothetical decision tree and provides the requested outputs. However, remember that this is still a hypothetical example and would need to be trained on real data for a realistic application.
