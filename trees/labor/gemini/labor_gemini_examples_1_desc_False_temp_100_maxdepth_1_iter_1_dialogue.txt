```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    total_wage_increase = X['wage increase first year'] + X['wage increase second year'] + X['wage increase third year']
    nodes[0] = total_wage_increase <= 10 
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Good outcome
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Calculates Total Wage Increase:**  The function now calculates the `total_wage_increase` by summing the wage increases over the three years. This aligns with the hypothetical decision tree logic based on total wage increase.

2. **Uses Meaningful Threshold:** The threshold of 10% total wage increase is still a placeholder.  Ideally, this should be determined from actual data analysis.  However, it's a more reasonable starting point than an arbitrary value for demonstration purposes.

3. **Clearer Comments:**  Comments now explicitly state "Bad outcome" and "Good outcome" for clarity.

4. **Adheres to Input Format:** The function correctly uses the provided dictionary keys to access feature values.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Bad - because 3+3+3=9 <= 10)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True]

example_features['wage increase third year'] = 5
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Good - because 3+3+5=11 > 10)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False]

```



This improved function demonstrates the requested format and incorporates a more relevant feature calculation.  Remember that to build a truly accurate predictive model, you'll need to train a decision tree (or another machine learning algorithm) on a real dataset of labor negotiation outcomes.
