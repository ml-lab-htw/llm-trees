Key improvements:

* **Clearer structure:** The code now closely mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Meaningful thresholds:** A 10% total wage increase threshold is used (you can adjust this based on domain knowledge). "Full" health plan coverage is used as the secondary criterion.
* **Boolean handling:** The code now correctly handles boolean values for features like `education allowance` and `longterm disability assistance`.
* **Example usage:** The included example demonstrates how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.
* **Type hinting:** Added type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code clarity.


This revised version provides a more robust and practical implementation of the decision tree classifier for labor negotiation outcomes. Remember that to get truly meaningful results, you'll need to train a decision tree model on real-world data using a machine learning library. This example serves as a good starting point for understanding the fundamental concepts.
