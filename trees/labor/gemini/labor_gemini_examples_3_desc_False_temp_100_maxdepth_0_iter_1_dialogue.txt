**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The code now includes mappings for the categorical features "cost of living adjustment" and "contribution to health plan" to convert them into numerical representations (0, 1, 2). This is essential for numerical comparisons.  I've added default values to the mapping using `.get()` to handle potential missing values gracefully.

2. **Average Wage Increase:** The average wage increase is now calculated correctly within the decision logic.

3. **Thresholds:**  Specific numerical thresholds have been incorporated into the decision logic, reflecting the assumptions about their impact on the outcome.

4. **Clearer Structure:** The code uses `elif` and `else` statements to represent the different branches of the decision tree more clearly.

5. **Error Handling:**  Default values in the mappings help prevent errors if a feature has an unexpected value.


**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 4,
    'wage increase third year': 4.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf', 
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```


This improved version provides a more robust and functional implementation of the decision tree logic as a Python function.  Remember, the thresholds and structure are based on assumptions, and real-world application would require training a model with actual data.
