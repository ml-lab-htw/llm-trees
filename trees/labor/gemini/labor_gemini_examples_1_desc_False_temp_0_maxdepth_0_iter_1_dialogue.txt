**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values (e.g., 4.0 for the first-year wage increase) based on the provided feature descriptions and the initial hypothetical tree. These should be adjusted based on actual data analysis.
* **Encoding:** The code handles string values for categorical features like "cost of living adjustment" and "contribution to health plan."  It's important that the input data uses the correct encoding as specified in your feature description.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores boolean values (True/False), which are then converted to 1/0 for output.
* **Clarity and Consistency:** The code is structured to more closely match the hypothetical tree logic, improving readability.
* **Example Usage:** Added example dictionaries to demonstrate how to use the `predict` function.  Replace these with your real data.


Remember, this function still represents the *hypothetical* tree. To build a more accurate and robust decision tree, you *must* provide training data. Using a machine learning library like scikit-learn is highly recommended for building decision trees from data.  It will handle feature selection, threshold optimization, and model evaluation automatically.
