```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.5  # Threshold between low and acceptable/good wage increase
    nodes[1] = X['duration'] <= 3  # Threshold for short duration
    nodes[2] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full' # Check for full health plan contribution


    if nodes[0]: # Low first-year wage increase
        if X['cost of living adjustment'] == 0: # No COLA
            prediction = 0  # Bad
        else:  # Some form of COLA present
            prediction = 1 # Good (marginally, could be refined with more features/depth)
    else: # Acceptable/good wage increase in first year
        if nodes[1]: # Short duration
            prediction = 0 # Bad
        else: # Longer duration
            if nodes[2]: # Full health plan contribution
                prediction = 1 # Good
            else:  # Not full health plan contribution
                prediction = 1  # Still good, potentially slightly less so


    return prediction, nodes



```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added concrete threshold values (4.5 for the first-year wage increase, 3 for duration) to make the function operational.  These are still example values â€“ ideally, you'd determine them based on data analysis.
* **COLA Handling:** The tree now explicitly checks for the absence of a COLA  (`'none'`) in the case of low wage increases, as this would likely lead to a "Bad" outcome.
* **Health Plan:** The check for a full health plan contribution is placed within the context of both good wage increases and longer durations.
* **Return Values:**  The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values (True/False or 1/0) for the conditions at each node, as requested.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_input = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 6,
    'wage increase second year': 3,  # Not used in this simplified tree
    'wage increase third year': 4,    # Not used in this simplified tree
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf', # Not directly used in this branch, but important in others
    'working hours': 38,             # Not used
    'pension': 'empl_contr',          # Not used
    'standby pay': 10,               # Not used
    'shift differential': 5,         # Not used
    'education allowance': True,      # Not used
    'statutory holidays': 12,        # Not used
    'vacation': 'avg',               # Not used
    'longterm disability assistance': True, # Not used
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',# Not used
    'bereavement assistance': False,    # Not used
    'contribution to health plan': 'full' 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [False, False, True] (because 6 > 4.5, 5 > 3, and health plan is 'full')

```


This improved function demonstrates how to create a decision tree classifier in Python code based on specified features and conditions.  Remember, using a machine learning library with real-world data would be necessary for a truly effective and data-driven decision tree.
