**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on the provided feature ranges. For example, a first-year wage increase of 3.5% or less is considered low.  These are just examples, and the optimal thresholds would need to be determined from data.
* **Categorical Features:** The code handles categorical features like "cost of living adjustment" and "contribution to health plan" directly within the conditional statements.
* **Ordinal Features:** Features like "vacation" are also incorporated, using their ordinal nature ( "ba" < "avg" < "gnr") to influence the prediction.
* **Simplified Structure:** I've simplified the nested `if/else` structure to make it more readable and efficient while still reflecting the logic of the original decision tree.
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions at each inner node, as requested.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'duration': 2,
    'wage increase first year': 2.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'ba',  # Below average vacation
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

This example would likely result in a `prediction` of 0 (bad) because of the low first-year wage increase, lack of COLA, short contract duration, and below-average vacation days.  The `nodes` list would show the truth values of each condition that led to this prediction.


This improved function provides a more practical and functional implementation of the decision tree for predicting labor negotiation outcomes. Remember that real-world application would necessitate training with actual data to determine optimal thresholds and potentially a more complex tree structure or a different machine learning algorithm altogether.
