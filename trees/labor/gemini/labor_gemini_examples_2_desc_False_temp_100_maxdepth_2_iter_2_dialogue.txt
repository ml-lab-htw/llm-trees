You got it! Here's the Python function for a depth-2 decision tree predicting labor negotiation outcomes, along with explanations and considerations for thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features. Keys are feature names, values are feature values.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) 
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 1: Wage increase in the first year
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >= 4.0  # Threshold: Assuming 4% is a significant increase

    # Node 2: Contribution to health plan (only evaluated if Node 1 is True)
    nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full' if nodes[0] else False 

    # Prediction Logic:
    if nodes[0]:  # High wage increase in the first year
        if nodes[1]:  # Full health plan contribution
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome likely
        else: 
            prediction = 0  # Less likely to be good without full health plan
    else:  # Low initial wage increase
        prediction = 0  # Generally leaning towards a bad outcome 

    return prediction, nodes 

```

**Explanation:**

* **Feature Selection:** I've chosen "wage increase first year" and "contribution to health plan" as the key features. These are common sticking points in negotiations and likely have a strong influence on the outcome.
* **Thresholds:**
    * **Wage Increase:** A 4% increase is used as a threshold. This could be adjusted based on historical data or industry standards.
    * **Health Plan:** "Full" contribution is a strong indicator of a good deal for employees.
* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list tracks whether the conditions at each node are met (`1` for True, `0` for False). This can be useful for understanding the decision path.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data-Driven Decisions:** The choice of features, thresholds, and the overall tree structure should ideally be determined using a dataset of past labor negotiations and techniques like information gain or Gini impurity to measure feature importance.
* **Model Complexity:**  A depth-2 tree is very limited. You'll likely need a deeper tree or a more complex model to capture the nuances of real-world labor negotiations accurately.

**How to Use the Function:**

```python
# Example Input (replace with your actual data)
example_negotiation = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 5.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    # ... other features ...
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(example_negotiation)

# Print the results
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}") 
```

Remember, this is a simplified example to get you started. Real-world applications require careful data analysis, model selection, and evaluation.
