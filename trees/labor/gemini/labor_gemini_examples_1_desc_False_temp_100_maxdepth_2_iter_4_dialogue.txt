def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    total_wage_increase = X['wage increase first year'] + X['wage increase second year'] + X['wage increase third year']
    nodes[0] = total_wage_increase <= 12.0  # Threshold for total wage increase

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad - Low total wage increase
    else:
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Bad -  Higher wages but no health plan contribution
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Good - Higher wages and some health plan contribution

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`total_wage_increase <= 12.0`:** Assuming wage increases are given in percentage points, a total increase of 12% or less over three years might be considered low in some negotiation contexts. This is a placeholder and would ideally be determined by analyzing real negotiation data.
* **`X['contribution to health plan'] == 0`:** The absence of any employer contribution to the health plan is a strong indicator of a potentially "bad" outcome, even if the total wage increase is reasonable.


**Important Note:** This function directly implements the decision tree logic based on the assumed feature importance and chosen thresholds. It does not involve any training.  To build a true decision tree model, you would need to use a machine learning library like scikit-learn with a labeled dataset.  The library would handle the complexities of feature selection, splitting, and threshold determination automatically.
