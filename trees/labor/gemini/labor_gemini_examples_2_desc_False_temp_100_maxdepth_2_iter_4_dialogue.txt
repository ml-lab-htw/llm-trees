def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on input features.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the values for the following features:
      'duration', 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year', 
      'wage increase third year', 'cost of living adjustment', 'working hours', 
      'pension', 'standby pay', 'shift differential', 'education allowance', 
      'statutory holidays', 'vacation', 'longterm disability assistance', 
      'contribution to dental plan', 'bereavement assistance', 
      'contribution to health plan'

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - The prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good).
      - A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the 
        condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

  nodes = 2 * [None]

  # Hypothetical important features and thresholds (replace with your findings)
  nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >= 4.0 
  nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'

  if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1]:
      prediction = 1  # Good if high first-year wage increase AND full health
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Likely bad if no full health even with good wage
  else:
    prediction = 0 # Likely bad if low first-year wage increase

  return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:**  The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single labor negotiation instance. 

2. **Nodes List:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` initializes a list to store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node of our depth-2 tree.

3. **Feature and Threshold Selection (Hypothetical):**
   -  `nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >= 4.0`: This represents the root node's decision. I've hypothetically chosen "wage increase first year" as a crucial feature and set a threshold of 4.0.  You'll need to determine the most important features and appropriate thresholds from your data analysis.
   - `nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'`: For the second level, I'm using "contribution to health plan".

4. **Prediction Logic:** The `if-else` block implements the decision tree logic based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.

**Important:**

* **Replace Placeholders:** The chosen features, thresholds, and even the tree structure are placeholders. You **must** replace them with the insights gained from analyzing your labor negotiation dataset.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use feature importance from decision tree algorithms or other techniques to determine which features are most predictive in your dataset.
* **Threshold Tuning:** Finding the optimal thresholds for numerical features might require experimentation and validation. 

Remember, this code is a starting point. Its effectiveness depends entirely on using the correct features and thresholds learned from your specific labor negotiation data.
