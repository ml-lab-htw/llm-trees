It's impossible to give you a precise, data-driven decision tree without actual labor negotiation data. However, I can create a **template function** and demonstrate how to structure it based on your requirements and hypothetical thresholds. 

**Assumptions (due to lack of data):**

* **Important Features:** I'll assume 'wage increase first year' and 'cost of living adjustment' are important based on common sense. 
* **Thresholds:** These are guesses; you'll need to adjust them with real data.

```python
def predict_labor_outcome(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations based on input features.

  Args:
      X (dict): A dictionary containing feature values. 

  Returns:
      tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0: bad, 1: good) 
             and a list representing the truth values of inner nodes.
  """

  nodes = 2 * [None]

  # Node 1: Wage increase in the first year
  nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] >= 3.5  # Hypothetical threshold 

  # Node 2: Cost of Living Adjustment (assuming 'tcf' is favorable)
  nodes[1] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tcf'

  if nodes[0]:  # High initial wage increase 
      if nodes[1]:  # Favorable COLA
          prediction = 1 # Good
      else:
          prediction = 0 # Bad 
  else: # Low initial wage increase
      prediction = 0 # Likely bad

  return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage
example_negotiation = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 2.8,
    'wage increase second year': 2.5,
    'wage increase third year': 2.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict_labor_outcome(example_negotiation)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_labor_outcome(X)`:** Takes a dictionary `X` representing negotiation features.
2. **`nodes`:** Initializes a list to store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the decision nodes.
3. **Node 1:** Checks if the 'wage increase first year' is greater than or equal to 3.5 (hypothetical threshold). 
4. **Node 2:** Checks if the 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tcf' (assumed favorable).
5. **Decision Logic:** The `if/else` block implements a basic decision tree structure based on the nodes. 
6. **Return:** Returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list.

**To make this function truly useful:**

1. **Real Data:** Replace the example with your actual labor negotiation data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Explore and engineer features (e.g., combining features, creating interaction terms) that might be more predictive. 
3. **Decision Tree Algorithm:** Use a machine learning library like scikit-learn to train a decision tree classifier on your data. The library will automatically determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure. 
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of your decision tree using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) and refine it as needed.
