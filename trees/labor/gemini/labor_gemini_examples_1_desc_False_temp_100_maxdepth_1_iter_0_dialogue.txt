**Explanation and Justification of Threshold:**

The chosen threshold of 13% total wage increase over three years is a reasonable starting point.  It assumes that a cumulative increase below this level might be perceived as insufficient by the employees, leading to a "bad" negotiation outcome. This is, of course, a simplified assumption.  In reality, the ideal threshold would depend on factors like inflation, industry standards, and the specific economic context.

**Importance of Data-Driven Refinement:**

It's crucial to remember that this 13% threshold is a placeholder.  To obtain a truly accurate and reliable decision tree, you *must* train it on a dataset of historical labor negotiations.  This data will reveal the actual relationships between features and outcomes and allow you to determine the optimal threshold value using a suitable algorithm.  The provided function is a basic structure; its effectiveness will significantly improve with data-driven refinement.
