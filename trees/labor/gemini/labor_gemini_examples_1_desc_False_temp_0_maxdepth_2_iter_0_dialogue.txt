**Key Improvements:**

* **Clear Thresholds:**  Uses 4.5 as a split point for the first-year wage increase. This is arbitrary but demonstrates how a threshold would work. A true decision tree algorithm would find this value by analyzing the training data.  The health plan contribution uses string comparison.
* **Python Function:**  Formatted as a Python function that takes a dictionary of features as input and returns the prediction and the `nodes` list.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which become 1/0 when used in numerical context) of the conditions at each node. This provides a trace of the decision path.
* **Feature Names:** Uses the correct feature names provided in your prompt.


This improved version provides a functional Python implementation that you can test and adapt further.  Remember that the accuracy of this tree depends heavily on the quality and quantity of your training data, which you would use with a real decision tree algorithm.
