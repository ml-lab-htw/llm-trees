```



**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`Threshold_1 = 9.0`:** This represents a total wage increase of 9% over three years. This is an example value. A more informed threshold would come from analyzing typical wage increases in the specific industry being considered. You might want to set the threshold slightly below average to classify outcomes below average as "bad."


* **`strong_cola`:** Checks if the 'cost of living adjustment' is 'tcf' (temporary cost of living adjustment formula) or 'tc' (total compensation adjustment), assuming these provide sufficient protection against inflation.


* **`good_health_pension`:** Checks for at least 'half' contribution to the health plan and at least a retirement allowance or employee contribution to the pension plan. This represents a reasonably good benefits package.  Again, these are reasonable starting points, but should be refined based on domain expertise and data analysis if available.



**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 2.5,
    'wage increase second year': 2.5,
    'wage increase third year': 2.0,  # Total 7%
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Bad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [1, 0] (First condition true, second false)



X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5, # Total 10%
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (Good)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [0, 1] (First condition false, second true)

```


This function now adheres to the specified format, providing both the prediction and a list of node truth values. Remember, the effectiveness of this decision tree depends heavily on appropriate threshold values, which should ideally be determined through data analysis.
