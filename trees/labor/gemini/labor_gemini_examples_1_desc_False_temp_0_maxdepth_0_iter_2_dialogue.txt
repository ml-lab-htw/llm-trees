**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`wage increase first year <= 3.0`**:  This threshold represents a relatively low wage increase, likely leading to dissatisfaction.  3.0 is chosen as a reasonable dividing line within the 2.0-7.0 range.
* **`cost of living adjustment != 0`**: The presence of *any* cost of living adjustment is considered beneficial.
* **`duration <= 2`**: A short contract duration (2 years or less) combined with low wage increases suggests a "bad" deal.
* **`contribution to health plan != 0`**:  The absence of health plan contributions is a negative factor. Any level of contribution ("half" or "full") is considered better than none.
* **`vacation == 1` (below average):** When health contributions are absent, below-average vacation days further contribute to a "bad" outcome.


**Using the Function:**

```python
example_features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 2.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (bad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False, False, False]
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `predict` function with a sample feature dictionary. The output shows the prediction (0 for "bad") and the truth values of the inner nodes.  Remember that this tree is still hypothetical and the thresholds and structure would need to be refined using real data and a decision tree learning algorithm.
