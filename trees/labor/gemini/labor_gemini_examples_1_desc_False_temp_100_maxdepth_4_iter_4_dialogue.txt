**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable placeholder thresholds.  With actual data, these would be determined by the decision tree learning algorithm (like the one in scikit-learn) to maximize the separation between "good" and "bad" outcomes.
* **Feature Importance:**  The order and selection of features in the tree are also placeholders. The learning algorithm will identify the most important features and where they should be placed in the tree for optimal performance.
* **Categorical Features:** The code handles categorical features like "contribution to health plan" and "pension" directly in the conditional statements. For better performance with real-world data, you'd typically convert these to numerical representations (one-hot encoding or label encoding) before training the decision tree model.
* **Depth Limit:** The code adheres to the maximum depth of 4.
* **Python Function:** The code is now a Python function that takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This improved version provides a functional template, but the performance will be significantly better once trained on a real dataset using a proper machine learning library.  The thresholds and feature splits will then be data-driven and optimized for accuracy.
