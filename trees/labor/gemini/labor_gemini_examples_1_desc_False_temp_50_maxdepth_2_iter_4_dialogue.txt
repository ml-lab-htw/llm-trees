**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Combined Wage Increase:** The `combined_wage_increase` variable is calculated by summing the wage increases over the three years.  The threshold (`12`) represents a combined 12% increase over three years (an average of 4% per year).  This threshold should be adjusted based on economic data and industry standards.
* **Cost of Living Adjustment:**  We check if the `cost of living adjustment` is 'none'.  The presence of any COLA (even a temporary one) is considered better than no COLA.
* **Health Plan Contribution:** We check for 'none' or 'half' contributions. A "full" contribution is considered a good outcome.
* **Threshold Justification:** The chosen threshold for the combined wage increase (12) assumes a context where a total 4% average annual increase is seen as relatively low. This is a placeholder and would need refinement based on real-world data or expert knowledge.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list now accurately reflects the truth values of the decision nodes, following the requested format.


This improved function adheres to the specified format, provides a more concrete decision tree, and includes justification for the chosen thresholds.  Remember, real-world application would require data-driven threshold optimization and potentially a more complex tree structure.
