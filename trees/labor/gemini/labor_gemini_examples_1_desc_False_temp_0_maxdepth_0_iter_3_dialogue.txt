**Key improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  The thresholds are now explicitly defined with reasonable values relevant to the features (e.g., 3.0 for the first-year wage increase).
* **Feature Names:** The code now uses the exact feature names provided, improving accuracy.
* **Integer Node Values:**  The `node_values` list is now a list of integers (0 or 1) as requested.
* **Docstrings and Type Hinting:** Added for better readability and maintainability.
* **Example Usage:**  Included an example to demonstrate how to use the function.

**Important Note:** This function represents the *hypothetical* decision tree structure discussed earlier. To create a useful decision tree, you *must* train it on a real dataset of labor negotiation outcomes and their associated features.  This implementation provides a framework, but the actual thresholds and branching logic will be determined by the data. Using this function with real data without training will likely result in inaccurate predictions.
