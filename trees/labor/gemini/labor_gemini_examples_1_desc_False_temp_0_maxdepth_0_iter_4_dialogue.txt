**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (e.g., `4.0` for the first-year wage increase, `3.0` for the second year) are placeholders.  To determine the best thresholds, you would need to analyze your training data.  Techniques like Gini impurity or information gain (used by decision tree algorithms) help find optimal split points.
* **Feature Importance:** The chosen features (wage increases in the first and second year, cost of living adjustment, and health plan contribution) are assumed to be important.  Feature importance is also determined during the training process of a decision tree algorithm.  Features not used in the tree are considered less relevant by the algorithm based on the training data.
* **Data Encoding:**  The code handles different data types: numerical (wage increase), categorical (cost of living adjustment, health plan, pension), and boolean (education allowance, longterm disability assistance, bereavement assistance).  Make sure your input `X` matches these types.
* **Depth and Complexity:**  The tree is relatively shallow.  A real-world decision tree might be more complex, depending on the data. The depth and complexity are automatically controlled by decision tree algorithms based on parameters like maximum depth or minimum samples per leaf.


**How to Use:**

```python
example_negotiation = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 2.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 40,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': False,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none' 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_negotiation)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: 0 (bad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [False, False, False, False]
```


This improved version provides a more robust structure and considers more features relevant to labor negotiations.  Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values derived from your training data using a suitable decision tree learning algorithm. This example demonstrates a simplified decision tree; you can adjust the features and logic based on your specific dataset and domain expertise.
