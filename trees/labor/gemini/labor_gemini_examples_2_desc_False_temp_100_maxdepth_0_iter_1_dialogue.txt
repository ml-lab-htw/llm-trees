                prediction = 0 # Bad outcome (low wage increase, short duration)
        else: # No/partial health plan

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`wage increase first year > 4.0`:**  A wage increase above 4% in the first year is likely a significant factor in a "good" outcome. This threshold is a reasonable starting point, but ideally, this should be determined from data analysis (e.g., finding the median or a value that best separates good and bad outcomes).
* **`cost of living adjustment != "none"`:**  Having *any* cost of living adjustment is likely a positive indicator.
* **`duration > 3`:**  A contract duration of more than 3 years suggests stability and could be considered "good," especially if combined with other benefits.
* **`contribution to health plan == "full"`:** A full contribution to the health plan is a significant benefit and could contribute to a "good" outcome, especially when wages might be lower.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data-Driven Thresholds:** The thresholds used in this example are somewhat arbitrary.  A proper decision tree should be trained on a labeled dataset to determine the optimal splits.  Libraries like `scikit-learn` can do this automatically.
* **Feature Importance:**  A decision tree algorithm can also tell you which features are the most important for making predictions.  This can help you refine your tree and focus on the most relevant factors.
* **Overfitting:** With limited data, a complex tree can overfit.  Pruning or setting complexity limits can help generalize the tree to new data.
* **Alternative Features:**  Consider creating combined features (e.g., total wage increase over the contract duration) or using domain expertise to engineer more informative features.


This improved answer provides a Python function, explains the chosen thresholds, and highlights important considerations for building a more robust decision tree based on real-world data.  Remember to replace these example thresholds with data-driven values when you have a dataset to train your model.
