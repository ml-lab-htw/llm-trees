    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["cost of living adjustment"] == 0:  # Using a more specific condition here
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:

This function directly implements the decision tree logic described in the previous response, using the specified feature names and thresholds. The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the decision nodes, as requested.  Remember, this is a simplified example. A real-world application would require training a decision tree model on actual data.
