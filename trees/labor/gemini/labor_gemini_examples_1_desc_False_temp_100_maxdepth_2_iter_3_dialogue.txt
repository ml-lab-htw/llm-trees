```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == 0  # Assuming "none" represents no COLA

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad if low first-year wage increase
    else:  # Higher first-year wage increase
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Bad if no COLA
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Good if any form of COLA

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function implements the hypothetical decision tree discussed previously. It uses the `wage increase first year` and `cost of living adjustment` features, following the same logic as the textual representation. It returns both the predicted outcome (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision nodes.


**Key Improvements:**

* **Correct feature names:**  Uses the exact feature names you provided.
* **COLA handling:** Explicitly checks if `cost of living adjustment` is "none".
* **Clearer logic:**  The code is formatted to reflect the decision tree structure more directly.
* **Type hinting:** Includes type hinting (`X: dict`) for better readability and maintainability.



**Important Reminder:**  This function is based on hypothetical feature importance.  A real-world application requires training a decision tree on actual data.  This code provides the structure for making predictions based on a predefined, simple tree.
