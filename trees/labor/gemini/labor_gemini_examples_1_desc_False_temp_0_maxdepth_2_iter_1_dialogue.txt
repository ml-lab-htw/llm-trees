**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Clear Threshold:** The `total_wage_increase` threshold is now explicitly defined (12% total over 3 years in this case, averaging 4% per year). Adjust this based on typical negotiation outcomes and economic conditions.
* **String Comparison:** The health plan contribution check uses string comparison (`== 'full'`) to match the provided feature encoding.
* **Docstring:**  A docstring has been added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
* **Example Usage:** The code includes an example of how to use the `predict` function with a sample dictionary of features.  You would replace this with your actual feature data.


This revised function provides a more complete and usable implementation of the decision tree for predicting labor negotiation outcomes, directly addressing the prompt's requirements.  Remember, this is still a simplified model.  Real-world applications benefit from more sophisticated approaches and data-driven analysis.
