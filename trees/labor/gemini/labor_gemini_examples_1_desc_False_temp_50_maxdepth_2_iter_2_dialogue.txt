**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  We've added a reasonable threshold of 4.5 for the first-year wage increase.  This separates "low" increases from "higher" ones.  Remember, this threshold is an estimate and ideally would be learned from data.
* **COLA Check:** We directly use the string comparison for the `cost of living adjustment` feature, as provided in the feature descriptions.
* **Health Plan Contribution:**  We check for "none" for the health plan contribution to align with the decision tree logic.
* **Simplified Logic:** The code now directly uses the `nodes[1]` value instead of recalculating the COLA condition, making it slightly more efficient.
* **Type Hinting:** Included type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code readability and maintainability.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.


**Example Usage:**

```python
features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3,
    'wage increase second year': 3,
    'wage increase third year': 3,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': False,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (bad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```


This improved function provides a clear and functional implementation of the decision tree, including the requested `nodes` list for tracking the conditions. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with data-driven values when you have a real dataset.
