```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Hypothetical important features and thresholds:
    nodes[0] = (X['wage increase first year'] + X['wage increase second year'] + 
                X['wage increase third year']) > 9.0  # Total wage increase
    nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'  

    if nodes[0]:  # High total wage increase
        if nodes[1]:  # Full health plan
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else: 
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome (likely, but depends on other factors)
    else:  # Low total wage increase
        prediction = 0  # Likely a bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` List:** This list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each node of the decision tree. Since we have a maximum depth of 2, we initialize the list with two elements.

2. **Feature Selection and Thresholds:** 
   -  We use a simplified assumption for demonstration:
      - **Node 0:**  The sum of wage increases over the three years being greater than 9.0 is considered a strong positive factor. 
      - **Node 1:**  A "full" contribution to the health plan is considered positive.
   - **Real-World Scenario:** In reality, you'd use a decision tree algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) with your dataset to determine the most important features and the optimal thresholds.

3. **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` structure implements the decision logic of the tree based on the truth values in `nodes`.

**How to Use It:**

```python
# Example input (representing one labor negotiation):
input_features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 2.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 11,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full' 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)

print(f"Prediction (0=Bad, 1=Good): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}")
```

**Key Points:**

* **Data-Driven:**  Remember, the effectiveness of this tree depends entirely on the quality of your dataset and how well the selected features and thresholds reflect real-world negotiation dynamics.
* **Iteration is Key:**  Experiment with different features, thresholds, and potentially a deeper tree (if your data supports it) to improve accuracy. 
* **Beyond Simple Rules:**  For complex negotiations, consider more advanced machine learning models that can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
