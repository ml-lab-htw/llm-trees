**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding:** The code now handles the categorical features (`cost of living adjustment`, `pension`, `vacation`, `contribution to health plan`) by encoding them into numerical values for the decision tree logic.  This is essential for making comparisons.
* **Thresholds:**  More realistic threshold values have been added based on the provided feature descriptions and the logic from the previous hypothetical tree.
* **Simplified Branches:** Some branches have been simplified for clarity and to fit the depth constraint.  For example, the contribution to the health plan is used as a major factor in the "good" outcome branch.
* **Ambiguity Handling:**  The code still reflects the ambiguity in some branches by using vacation days as a tiebreaker. In a real-world model, you'd want more data and potentially more features to resolve this ambiguity.
* **Pythonic Structure:** The code is now formatted as a proper Python function, taking a dictionary `X` (representing the features) as input and returning the prediction and the list of node truth values.



**Using the Function:**

```python
example_features = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 4.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 2.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Good)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, 1, 1, 1]
```

Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* example. A robust model requires training on a real dataset using machine learning libraries.  This example provides a starting point for how you might structure the logic and incorporate your domain knowledge.
