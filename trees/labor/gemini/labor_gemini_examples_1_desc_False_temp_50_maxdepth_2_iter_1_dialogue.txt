**Key Improvements:**

* **Threshold:** A reasonable `Threshold_1` of 12 is set, representing a total wage increase of 12% over three years. This could be adjusted based on real-world data.
* **Integer Nodes:** The `nodes` list now contains integer values (0 or 1) as requested.
* **Clearer Logic:** The code is more readable and directly reflects the decision tree's structure.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to call the function and interpret the output.


This improved function now meets the specified requirements and provides a more practical and usable implementation.  Remember that the threshold and feature importance assumptions are placeholders. Using a real dataset and a decision tree training algorithm would produce a more robust and accurate model.
