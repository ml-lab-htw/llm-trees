**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  The thresholds are now based on reasonable assumptions about what might influence a "good" or "bad" negotiation outcome. For example, a first-year wage increase above 4% is considered a good starting point.  Adjust these thresholds based on your domain expertise.
* **Categorical Feature Handling:** The code explicitly handles categorical features like "cost of living adjustment," "vacation," and "pension" by comparing their string values.
* **Depth Control:**  The tree structure strictly adheres to the maximum depth of 4.
* **Placeholder Values:**  In branches where a node isn't evaluated (due to earlier branching decisions), placeholder `False` values are assigned to `nodes[2]` and `nodes[3]` to ensure the `nodes` list always has four entries. This makes the function more robust.
* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure is more organized, making it easier to follow the decision-making process.

**To Use the Function:**

```python
example_input = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 5.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 37.5,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 11,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```

Remember to replace the example thresholds and branching logic with values that are appropriate for your specific labor negotiation context.  The most effective way to refine the tree is to train it on real data, as mentioned earlier.  This example provides a functional structure and demonstrates how to handle different feature types.
