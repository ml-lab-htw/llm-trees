Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree, formatted according to your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    # Node 0: contribution to health plan == 'full'
    nodes[0] = int(X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full')
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Good
    else:
        # Node 1: wage increase first year > 5.0
        nodes[1] = int(X['wage increase first year'] > 5.0)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:
            # Node 2: pension == 'empl_contr'
            nodes[2] = int(X['pension'] == 'empl_contr')
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Good
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Bad
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `'contribution to health plan'`: Employer's contribution towards the health plan (`'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`).
  - `'wage increase first year'`: Wage increase in the first year of the contract (`2.0` to `7.0`).
  - `'pension'`: Employer contributions to the pension plan (`'none'`, `'ret_allw'`, `'empl_contr'`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is `'full'`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the wage increase in the first year is greater than `5.0%`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the employer's contribution to the pension plan is `'empl_contr'` (which we interpret as full contribution).

- **Prediction:**
  - Returns `1` for **Good** and `0` for **Bad**, based on the decision tree logic.

**Assumptions:**

- **Pension Feature Mapping:**
  - The possible values for `'pension'` are `'none'`, `'ret_allw'`, and `'empl_contr'`.
  - We interpret `'empl_contr'` (employer contribution) as equivalent to a **full** employer contribution toward the pension plan.

**Usage Example:**

Given an input dictionary `X` representing the features:

```python
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37.5,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'false',
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

In this example:

- The employer's contribution to the health plan is `'half'`, so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- The wage increase in the first year is `4.5%`, which is not greater than `5.0%`, so `nodes[1] = 0`.
- The employer contributes to the pension plan (`'empl_contr'`), so `nodes[2] = 1`.
- The overall prediction is **Good** because the third condition is satisfied.
