Sure! Based on the decision tree we constructed earlier, here is the Python function `predict` that returns a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize list for nodes [0..4]

    # Node evaluations
    nodes[0] = int(X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['contribution to health plan'] == 0)
    nodes[2] = int(X['vacation'] == 1)
    nodes[3] = int(X['cost of living adjustment'] == 0)
    nodes[4] = int(X['pension'] == 0)

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Wage increase in first year <= 4%
        if nodes[1]:  # Employer's contribution towards the health plan: none
            prediction = 0  # Bad
        else:  # Employer's contribution towards the health plan: half or full
            if nodes[2]:  # Number of paid vacation days: below average
                prediction = 0  # Bad
            else:  # Number of paid vacation days: average or generous
                prediction = 0  # Bad
    else:  # Wage increase in first year > 4%
        if nodes[3]:  # Cost of living adjustment: none
            prediction = 0  # Bad
        else:  # Cost of living adjustment: tcf or tc
            if nodes[4]:  # Employer contributions to pension plan: none
                prediction = 0  # Bad
            else:  # Employer contributions to pension plan: ret_allw or empl_contr
                prediction = 1  # Good

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'wage increase first year'`: Wage increase in the first year (float between 2.0 and 7.0).
  - `'contribution to health plan'`: Employer's contribution towards the health plan (`'none'`, `'half'`, or `'full'`).
  - `'vacation'`: Number of paid vacation days (`'ba'` for below average, `'avg'` for average, `'gnr'` for generous).
  - `'cost of living adjustment'`: Cost of living adjustment (`'none'`, `'tcf'`, or `'tc'`).
  - `'pension'`: Employer contributions to pension plan (`'none'`, `'ret_allw'`, or `'empl_contr'`).

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: `1` if wage increase in first year â‰¤ 4.0%, else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: `1` if employer's contribution towards the health plan is `'none'`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[2]`: `1` if number of paid vacation days is `'ba'` (below average), else `0`.
  - `nodes[3]`: `1` if cost of living adjustment is `'none'`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[4]`: `1` if employer contributions to pension plan is `'none'`, else `0`.

**Decision Path:**

1. **Node 0:** Check if the **wage increase in the first year** is less than or equal to **4.0%**.
   - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] == 1`):
     2. **Node 1:** Check if the **employer's contribution towards the health plan** is `'none'`.
        - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] == 1`):
          - **Prediction:** `0` (Bad outcome).
        - If **No** (`nodes[1] == 0`):
          3. **Node 2:** Check if the **number of paid vacation days** is `'ba'`.
             - If **Yes** (`nodes[2] == 1`):
               - **Prediction:** `0` (Bad outcome).
             - If **No** (`nodes[2] == 0`):
               - **Prediction:** `0` (Bad outcome).
   - If **No** (`nodes[0] == 0`):
     2. **Node 3:** Check if the **cost of living adjustment** is `'none'`.
        - If **Yes** (`nodes[3] == 1`):
          - **Prediction:** `0` (Bad outcome).
        - If **No** (`nodes[3] == 0`):
          3. **Node 4:** Check if the **employer contributions to pension plan** is `'none'`.
             - If **Yes** (`nodes[4] == 1`):
               - **Prediction:** `0` (Bad outcome).
             - If **No** (`nodes[4] == 0`):
               - **Prediction:** `1` (Good outcome).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'wage increase first year': 5.5,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full',
    'vacation': 'gnr',
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'pension': 'empl_contr'
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Prediction:** `1` implies a **Good** outcome for the labor negotiation.
- **Nodes:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` indicates that none of the conditions were satisfied at the nodes, following the path where the wage increase is greater than 4%, COLA is not `'none'`, and pension contribution is not `'none'`.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` includes all the required features with exact keys and appropriate values.
- The function strictly checks for equality in categorical features, so the spelling and case of the strings must match exactly.
- The nodes list provides insight into the decision path taken to arrive at the prediction.
