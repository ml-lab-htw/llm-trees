Certainly! Based on the decision tree we discussed earlier and following your instructions, here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. This function returns a single prediction (`0` for "bad" and `1` for "good") and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of this list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Wage increase in the first year of contract <= 4.0%
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0 else 0

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # If wage increase in the first year is ≤ 4.0%
        prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        # Node 1: Cost of living adjustment == 'none'
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["cost of living adjustment"] == 'none' else 0

        if nodes[1] == 1:
            # If cost of living adjustment is 'none'
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
        else:
            # If cost of living adjustment is not 'none'
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the first condition (`wage increase first year` ≤ 4.0%).
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the second condition (`cost of living adjustment` == 'none'). This is only evaluated if the first condition is not satisfied.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Condition (`nodes[0]`):**
     - Checks if the `wage increase first year` is less than or equal to 4.0%.
     - If **yes** (`nodes[0]` == 1):
       - The outcome is predicted as **Bad** (`prediction` = 0).
     - If **no** (`nodes[0]` == 0):
       - Proceeds to evaluate the second condition.

  2. **Second Condition (`nodes[1]`):**
     - Checks if the `cost of living adjustment` is `'none'`.
     - If **yes** (`nodes[1]` == 1):
       - The outcome is predicted as **Bad** (`prediction` = 0).
     - If **no** (`nodes[1]` == 0):
       - The outcome is predicted as **Good** (`prediction` = 1).

### Note on Thresholds and Feature Values:

- **Threshold for Wage Increase First Year:**
  - The threshold of **4.0%** is selected based on common industry standards where a wage increase of more than 4% is generally considered favorable by employees.

- **Cost of Living Adjustment Values:**
  - Possible values are `'none'`, `'tcf'`, and `'tc'`.
    - `'none'`: No cost of living adjustment.
    - `'tcf'`: Temporary cost of living adjustment formula.
    - `'tc'`: Total compensation adjustment.
  - The function checks for `'none'` to determine if there is no cost of living adjustment.

### Usage Example:

Here's how you might use the `predict` function with an example input:

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 5.0,
    'wage increase second year': 4.0,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'working hours': 37.5,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 15,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Making a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Good outcome" if prediction == 1 else "Bad outcome")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Output:

```
Prediction: Good outcome
Nodes truth values: [0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0]` == 0: The wage increase in the first year is **greater** than 4.0% (since 5.0% > 4.0%).
  - `nodes[1]` == 0: The cost of living adjustment is **not** `'none'` (it's `'tc'`).
  - The prediction is a **Good outcome**.
