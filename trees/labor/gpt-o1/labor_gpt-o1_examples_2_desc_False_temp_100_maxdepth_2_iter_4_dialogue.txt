Certainly! Based on the provided features and decision tree, here's the Python function `predict` that implements the decision tree classifier. The function returns the prediction (`0` for "bad" outcome and `1` for "good" outcome) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list contains truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5%.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates if the cost of living adjustment is a **total compensation adjustment** (`"tc"`).

- **Feature Keys:** The feature keys used in the function match exactly with the provided keys:
  - `"wage increase first year"`
  - `"cost of living adjustment"`

- **Thresholds and Values:**
  - **Wage Increase Threshold:** `4.5` is used as the meaningful threshold for the wage increase in the first year.
  - **Cost of Living Adjustment Values:** For the cost of living adjustment, we're comparing with `"tc"`, which stands for **total compensation adjustment**.

**Usage Example:**

Let's say we have the following feature values:

```python
X_sample = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 5.0,
    "wage increase second year": 4.0,
    "wage increase third year": 4.0,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tc",
    "working hours": 37.5,
    "pension": "empl_contr",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "full",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction:", "Good" if prediction == 1 else "Bad")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good
Nodes Truth Values: [False, True]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = False` because the wage increase in the first year (`5.0`) is not less than or equal to `4.5`.
  - `nodes[1] = True` because the cost of living adjustment is `"tc"` (total compensation adjustment).
  - The prediction is `1` (Good outcome) based on the decision tree logic.

**Note:** Ensure that when using the function, the feature values in the input dictionary `X` match the expected data types and encodings as described in the feature descriptions.
