Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries in the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the outcome of labor negotiations (0 = bad, 1 = good) based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    - X: dict
        A dictionary containing the feature values with exact keys as specified.

    Returns:
    - prediction: int
        The predicted outcome (0 = bad, 1 = good).
    - nodes: list of int
        A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize the list for three inner nodes

    # Node 0: Is the wage increase in the first year ≤ 4.0%?
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.0 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Is the 'contribution to health plan' equal to 'full'?
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full' else 0
        # Node 2 is not evaluated in this branch
        nodes[2] = 0
        # Make prediction based on Node 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        # Node 1 is not evaluated in this branch
        nodes[1] = 0
        # Node 2: Is the 'cost of living adjustment' equal to 'tc' (total compensation adjustment)?
        nodes[2] = 1 if X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'tc' else 0
        # Make prediction based on Node 2
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
- We initialize a list `nodes` with `None` values to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
- For each node in the decision tree, we evaluate the condition and store `1` if it's satisfied or `0` otherwise.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The outcome of the negotiation (`0` for bad, `1` for good).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values for each inner node (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Feature Keys** (ensure exact spelling):
  - `'duration'`
  - `'wage increase first year'`
  - `'wage increase second year'`
  - `'wage increase third year'`
  - `'cost of living adjustment'`
  - `'working hours'`
  - `'pension'`
  - `'standby pay'`
  - `'shift differential'`
  - `'education allowance'`
  - `'statutory holidays'`
  - `'vacation'`
  - `'longterm disability assistance'`
  - `'contribution to dental plan'`
  - `'bereavement assistance'`
  - `'contribution to health plan'`

- **Target Variable**:
  - `target`: Final settlements in labor negotiations in Canadian industry (`0` = bad, `1` = good)

**How the Function Works:**

1. **Node 0** checks if the **wage increase in the first year** is less than or equal to `4.0%`.
   - `nodes[0] = 1` if the condition is satisfied, else `0`.

2. **If Node 0 is true** (wage increase ≤ 4.0%):
   - **Node 1** checks if the **employer's contribution to health plan** is `'full'`.
     - `nodes[1] = 1` if the condition is satisfied, else `0`.
   - **Prediction**:
     - If `nodes[1] = 1`, outcome is **good** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else, outcome is **bad** (`prediction = 0`).
   - **Node 2** is set to `0` as it's not evaluated in this branch.

3. **If Node 0 is false** (wage increase > 4.0%):
   - **Node 1** is set to `0` as it's not evaluated in this branch.
   - **Node 2** checks if the **cost of living adjustment** is `'tc'` (total compensation adjustment).
     - `nodes[2] = 1` if the condition is satisfied, else `0`.
   - **Prediction**:
     - If `nodes[2] = 1`, outcome is **good** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else, outcome is **bad** (`prediction = 0`).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full',
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    # Other features can be included as needed
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good
Nodes: [1, 1, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the values in `X` match the expected encodings.
  - For example, `'contribution to health plan'` should be one of `'none'`, `'half'`, or `'full'`.
  - `'cost of living adjustment'` should be one of `'none'`, `'tcf'` (temporary cost of living adjustment formula), or `'tc'` (total compensation adjustment).
- The threshold of `4.0%` for **wage increase in the first year** is a meaningful value chosen to split the data effectively based on the ranges provided (`2.0% .. 7.0%`).

**Understanding the Decision Tree:**

- **First Split (Node 0)**:
  - Separates negotiations with lower wage increases from those with higher increases.
- **Left Branch (Wage Increase ≤ 4.0%)**:
  - Focuses on the employer's contribution to the health plan.
    - A full contribution can compensate for a lower wage increase, leading to a good outcome.
- **Right Branch (Wage Increase > 4.0%)**:
  - Focuses on the cost of living adjustments.
    - A total compensation adjustment (tc) indicates a favorable adjustment, leading to a good outcome.
