```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5%
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.5

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if employer's contribution to health plan is 'full'
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Outcome is 'good'
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if employer provides long-term disability assistance
            nodes[2] = X['longterm disability assistance'] == 'true'

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Outcome is 'good'
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Outcome is 'bad'
    else:
        # Node 3: Check if vacation is 'gnr' (generous)
        nodes[3] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'

        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Outcome is 'good'
        else:
            # Node 4: Check if working hours are less than or equal to 37.5
            nodes[4] = X['working hours'] <= 37.5

            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Outcome is 'good'
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Outcome is 'bad'
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]**: Checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5%.
- **nodes[1]**: If **nodes[0]** is `True`, checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is `'full'`.
- **nodes[2]**: If **nodes[1]** is `False`, checks if the employer provides long-term disability assistance (`'true'` or `'false'`).
- **nodes[3]**: If **nodes[0]** is `False`, checks if the vacation is `'gnr'` (generous).
- **nodes[4]**: If **nodes[3]** is `False`, checks if working hours are less than or equal to 37.5 hours.

**Note on Feature Keys and Values:**

- `'wage increase first year'`: Numerical value between `2.0` and `7.0`.
- `'contribution to health plan'`: Categorical value; one of `'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`.
- `'longterm disability assistance'`: Categorical value; `'true'` or `'false'`.
- `'vacation'`: Categorical value; `'ba'` (below average), `'avg'` (average), `'gnr'` (generous).
- `'working hours'`: Numerical value between `35` and `40`.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Sample input data
X_sample = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37.0,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'true',
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: good
Nodes: [True, False, True, None, None]
```

- **Interpretation of Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: `True` because wage increase first year `4.0 <= 4.5`.
  - `nodes[1]`: `False` because contribution to health plan is `'half'`, not `'full'`.
  - `nodes[2]`: `True` because long-term disability assistance is `'true'`.
  - `nodes[3]`: `None` because this node was not evaluated (the other branch of the tree).
  - `nodes[4]`: `None` because this node was not evaluated.

**Conclusion:**

- The function follows the decision tree logic, using the exact feature keys provided.
- It returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
- Make sure to input the feature values correctly, matching the expected data types and value ranges.
