Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable encoding. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` of feature values, evaluates the decision tree, and returns the prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Initialize a list to store truth values for inner nodes
    
    # Evaluate the condition at the root node
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["contribution to health plan"] == 'full' else 0

    # Make prediction based on the condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # 'good' outcome
    else:
        prediction = 0  # 'bad' outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `"contribution to health plan"`
- **Condition:** Check if the employer's contribution towards the health plan is `'full'`.
- **Prediction:**
  - If the condition is **True** (`nodes[0]` is `1`), the outcome is **`1` (good)**.
  - If the condition is **False** (`nodes[0]` is `0`), the outcome is **`0` (bad)**.
  
**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function with an example input:

```python
# Example input dictionary representing feature values
X_example = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.5,
    'wage increase second year': 4.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 15,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'  # This is the key feature
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")
print("Inner Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: good
Inner Nodes Truth Values: [1]
```

- The `nodes` list contains the truth value `[1]`, indicating that the condition `contribution to health plan == 'full'` is satisfied.
- The `prediction` is `1`, corresponding to a **good** outcome.

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the exact keys as specified and that the values match the expected data types and encodings.
