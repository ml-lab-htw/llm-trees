Certainly! Based on the provided features and their descriptions, we'll construct a decision tree of maximum depth 1, using the most significant feature. We'll then format this decision tree as a Python function `predict` that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Selected Feature and Threshold

We'll use **"wage increase first year"** as the feature for splitting, with a meaningful threshold at **4.0%**. This threshold is chosen because:

- A wage increase greater than 4.0% in the first year is likely to be considered a **good** outcome.
- A wage increase of 4.0% or less may be seen as a **bad** outcome from the employees' perspective.

### Python Function

Here's the `predict` function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad Outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Good Outcome
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation

- **Input**: The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` where keys are feature names (as specified) and values are their corresponding values.
- **Nodes**: We have a list `nodes` with one element, representing the truth value of the single internal node (since the tree has a maximum depth of 1).
  - `nodes[0]` is set to `True` if the condition `X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0` is satisfied, and `False` otherwise.
- **Prediction**:
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., the wage increase in the first year is **4.0% or less**), we predict `0` (Bad Outcome).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (i.e., the wage increase in the first year is **greater than 4.0%**), we predict `1` (Good Outcome).
- **Return**: The function returns a tuple `(prediction, nodes)`.

### Usage Example

Here's how you might use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 5.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 2.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'gnr',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Good Outcome' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad Outcome'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good Outcome
Nodes: [False]
```

- Since the wage increase in the first year is **5.0%**, which is greater than **4.0%**, the condition `X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0` is **False** (`nodes[0] = False`), and the prediction is `1` (Good Outcome).

### Notes

- **Feature Names**: Ensure that the keys in your input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature names provided, including spaces and lowercase lettering.
- **Threshold**: The threshold value of **4.0%** is based on the assumption that it meaningfully separates bad and good outcomes. In practice, this threshold should be determined through data analysis.

### Complete Function Code

Here is the complete code for clarity:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad Outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Good Outcome
    return prediction, nodes
```
