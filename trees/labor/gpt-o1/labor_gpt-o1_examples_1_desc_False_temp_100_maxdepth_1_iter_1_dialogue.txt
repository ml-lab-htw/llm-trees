Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the provided feature keys, here is the Python function that predicts the outcome (good or bad) of labor negotiations. The function returns the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Since the tree has a maximum depth of 1, there is only one inner node
    nodes[0] = int(X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0)  # 1 if condition is True, 0 otherwise

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Outcome: Bad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Outcome: Good

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Key Matching:** We use the exact feature key `"wage increase first year"` as provided in the list.
- **Threshold Value:** The threshold `4.0` is a meaningful value within the range of `2.0` to `7.0` for the "wage increase first year" feature.
- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list contains truth values of the inner nodes. Since there's only one decision node in the tree, the list has one element.
    - We convert the Boolean condition to an integer (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`) to match the requirement.
- **Prediction Encoding:** The prediction is `0` for "Bad" and `1` for "Good", as per the target variable encoding.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input features
X_sample = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 3.5,
    "wage increase second year": 4.0,
    "wage increase third year": 4.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "none",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": False,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

# Output
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bad
Inner Nodes Truth Values: [1]
```

This means that for the given input, the condition `wage increase first year <= 4.0` is satisfied (`True`), so the prediction is `"Bad"`.
