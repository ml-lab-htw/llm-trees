Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree you provided. The function `predict` accepts a dictionary `X` containing the features of a single data point. It returns the prediction (`0` for "bad" and `1` for "good") and a list of truth values for the inner nodes, where each entry is `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to hold truth values for the 5 inner nodes

    # Node 0: wage increase first year <= 3.0
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['wage increase first year'] <= 3.0 else 0

    # Node 1: contribution to health plan == 0
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['contribution to health plan'] == 0 else 0

    # Node 2: vacation == 'gnr' (generous)
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['vacation'] == 'gnr' else 0

    # Node 3: pension == 'empl_contr' (full contribution)
    nodes[3] = 1 if X['pension'] == 'empl_contr' else 0

    # Node 4: contribution to health plan == 'full'
    nodes[4] = 1 if X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full' else 0

    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 3.0%
        if nodes[1]:  # contribution to health plan == 0
            prediction = 0  # 'bad' outcome
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # vacation == 'gnr'
                prediction = 1  # 'good' outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # 'bad' outcome
    else:  # wage increase first year > 3.0%
        if nodes[3]:  # pension == 'empl_contr'
            prediction = 1  # 'good' outcome
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # contribution to health plan == 'full'
                prediction = 1  # 'good' outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # 'bad' outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` of length 5 to store the truth values (`1` or `0`) of the inner nodes of the decision tree.

- **Node Conditions:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if `'wage increase first year'` is less than or equal to `3.0`.
  - **Node 1:** Checks if `'contribution to health plan'` is `'none'`.
  - **Node 2:** Checks if `'vacation'` is `'gnr'` (which stands for generous).
  - **Node 3:** Checks if `'pension'` is `'empl_contr'` (which represents full employer contribution).
  - **Node 4:** Checks if `'contribution to health plan'` is `'full'`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If **Node 0** is `True` (wage increase in the first year is small), we proceed to evaluate **Node 1**.
    - If **Node 1** is `True` (no contribution to the health plan), the outcome is `'bad'` (`0`).
    - Else, we evaluate **Node 2**.
      - If **Node 2** is `True` (generous vacation), the outcome is `'good'` (`1`).
      - Else, the outcome is `'bad'` (`0`).
  - If **Node 0** is `False` (wage increase in the first year is more than `3.0`), we proceed to evaluate **Node 3**.
    - If **Node 3** is `True` (full pension contribution), the outcome is `'good'` (`1`).
    - Else, we evaluate **Node 4**.
      - If **Node 4** is `True` (full contribution to the health plan), the outcome is `'good'` (`1`).
      - Else, the outcome is `'bad'` (`0`).

**Feature Keys and Possible Values:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  ```
  ['duration', 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year', 
   'wage increase third year', 'cost of living adjustment', 
   'working hours', 'pension', 'standby pay', 'shift differential', 
   'education allowance', 'statutory holidays', 'vacation', 
   'longterm disability assistance', 'contribution to dental plan', 
   'bereavement assistance', 'contribution to health plan']
  ```

- **Key Mappings in the Function:**
  - `'wage increase first year'`: Wage increase in the first year of the contract (float value between `2.0` and `7.0`).
  - `'contribution to health plan'`: Employer's contribution towards the health plan (`'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`).
  - `'vacation'`: Number of paid vacation days (`'ba'` for below average, `'avg'` for average, `'gnr'` for generous).
  - `'pension'`: Employer contributions to the pension plan (`'none'`, `'ret_allw'` for retirement allowance included, `'empl_contr'` for employee contribution).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example feature input
X_example = {
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full',
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'pension': 'ret_allw',
    # ... include other features if necessary
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Note:** Make sure that the feature values provided in the input dictionary `X` match the expected types and encodings as per the features' descriptions. For categorical features, use the exact string values specified (e.g., `'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`, `'ba'`, `'avg'`, `'gnr'`, `'empl_contr'`).
