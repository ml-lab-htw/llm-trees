Certainly! Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree you provided. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, and returns a prediction (`0` for **bad**, `1` for **good**) along with a list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes of the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 4  # Initialize a list of 4 nodes

    # Node 0: wage increase in the first year <= 4.5%
    nodes[0] = int(X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5)

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: employer's contribution to health plan is 'full' or 'half'
        nodes[1] = int(X["contribution to health plan"] in ['full', 'half'])
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: employer's contribution to dental plan is 'full' or 'half'
            nodes[2] = int(X["contribution to dental plan"] in ['full', 'half'])
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        # Node 3: cost of living adjustment is 'tc' (total compensation adjustment)
        nodes[3] = int(X["cost of living adjustment"] == 'tc')
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5%.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is `'full'` or `'half'`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the employer's contribution to the dental plan is `'full'` or `'half'`.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the cost of living adjustment is `'tc'` (total compensation adjustment).

- **Predictions:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition satisfied), the function checks further conditions to determine if the outcome is good or bad.
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0`, it checks `nodes[3]` to make the prediction.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Feature Keys:** Use the exact keys as provided.
  - `"duration"`
  - `"wage increase first year"`
  - `"wage increase second year"`
  - `"wage increase third year"`
  - `"cost of living adjustment"`
  - `"working hours"`
  - `"pension"`
  - `"standby pay"`
  - `"shift differential"`
  - `"education allowance"`
  - `"statutory holidays"`
  - `"vacation"`
  - `"longterm disability assistance"`
  - `"contribution to dental plan"`
  - `"bereavement assistance"`
  - `"contribution to health plan"`

- **Encodings:**
  - `"cost of living adjustment"`: `"none"`, `"tcf"`, `"tc"`
  - `"contribution to health plan"`: `"none"`, `"half"`, `"full"`
  - `"contribution to dental plan"`: `"none"`, `"half"`, `"full"`

**Target Variable:**

- `target`: Final settlements in labor negotiations in Canadian industry
  - `0` = **bad**
  - `1` = **good**

**Example Usage:**

Here is how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 4.0,
    "wage increase second year": 3.5,
    "wage increase third year": 3.0,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "working hours": 38,
    "pension": "empl_contr",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "full",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "half"
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: good
Nodes Truth Values: [1, 1, 1, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required feature keys with appropriate values.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic provided, using meaningful threshold values and exact feature keys.
- The nodes list provides insight into which conditions were met (`1`) and which were not (`0`) during the prediction process.
