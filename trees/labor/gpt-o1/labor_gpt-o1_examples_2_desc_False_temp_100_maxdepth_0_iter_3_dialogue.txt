Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Node 0:** Is the wage increase in the first year **≥ 4.5%**?
   - **Yes:** Predict **Good Outcome** (1).
   - **No:** Proceed to Node 1.

2. **Node 1:** Is the employer's contribution towards the health plan **'full'**?
   - **Yes:** Predict **Good Outcome** (1).
   - **No:** Proceed to Node 2.

3. **Node 2:** Are the working hours **≤ 37.5 hours** per week?
   - **Yes:** Predict **Good Outcome** (1).
   - **No:** Predict **Bad Outcome** (0).

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Three inner nodes

    # Node 0: wage increase in first year >= 4.5%
    nodes[0] = int(X['wage increase first year'] >= 4.5)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Good outcome
    else:
        # Node 1: employer's contribution towards the health plan is 'full'
        nodes[1] = int(X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full')
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            # Node 2: working hours <= 37.5 hours
            nodes[2] = int(X['working hours'] <= 37.5)
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'wage increase first year'`: Wage increase in the first year of the contract (ranges from 2.0% to 7.0%).
  - `'contribution to health plan'`: Employer's contribution towards the health plan (`'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`).
  - `'working hours'`: Number of working hours during the week (ranges from 35 to 40 hours).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: 1 if wage increase in the first year is **≥ 4.5%**, else 0.
  - `nodes[1]`: 1 if employer's contribution to health plan is `'full'`, else 0.
  - `nodes[2]`: 1 if working hours are **≤ 37.5** hours per week, else 0.

- **Thresholds:**
  - **Wage Increase First Year Threshold (4.5%):**
    - Chosen as a meaningful value above the midpoint of the range (2.0% to 7.0%).
    - A higher wage increase is generally favorable for employees, indicating a good outcome.
  - **Working Hours Threshold (37.5 hours):**
    - Represents a reduction from the typical 40-hour workweek.
    - Fewer working hours are often considered a benefit for employees.

- **Assumptions:**
  - A good outcome in labor negotiations is characterized by favorable terms for employees, such as higher wage increases, full employer contributions to health plans, and fewer working hours.
  - The thresholds are set based on reasonable expectations in the context of labor negotiations.
  
- **Notes:**
  - **Exact Feature Names:** All feature names are used exactly as provided, including case and spacing.
  - **Categorical Variables:** Compared using string equality. Ensure that the values in the input dictionary match the expected strings (e.g., `'full'`).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 5.0,
    'wage increase second year': 4.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'true',
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'gnr',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Good" if prediction == 1 else "Bad")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good
Nodes truth values: [1, None, None]
```

**Explanation of Output:**

- **Node 0:** The wage increase in the first year is 5.0%, which is **≥ 4.5%**.
  - `nodes[0]` is set to 1.
  - Since this condition is satisfied, the prediction is **Good Outcome** (1).
  - Nodes 1 and 2 are not evaluated and remain `None`.

**Additional Example:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'duration': 2,
    'wage increase first year': 3.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 40,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 3,
    'education allowance': 'false',
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Good" if prediction == 1 else "Bad")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bad
Nodes truth values: [0, 0, 0]
```

**Explanation of Output:**

- **Node 0:** The wage increase in the first year is 3.0%, which is **< 4.5%**.
  - `nodes[0]` is set to 0.
- **Node 1:** The employer's contribution to the health plan is `'half'`, not `'full'`.
  - `nodes[1]` is set to 0.
- **Node 2:** The working hours are 40, which is **> 37.5** hours.
  - `nodes[2]` is set to 0.
- Since none of the conditions lead to a good outcome, the prediction is **Bad Outcome** (0).

**Usage Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary keys with correctly formatted values.
- Categorical values should match the expected strings exactly (e.g., `'full'`, `'half'`, `'none'`, `'true'`, `'false'`).
- Numerical values should be within the specified ranges.

**Conclusion:**

- The function `predict` implements the decision tree classifier based on the most important features and returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
- The decision tree uses meaningful thresholds to classify the outcomes as good or bad based on labor negotiation features.
- By following this structure, the function can be used to make predictions on new data points and analyze which conditions led to the prediction.
