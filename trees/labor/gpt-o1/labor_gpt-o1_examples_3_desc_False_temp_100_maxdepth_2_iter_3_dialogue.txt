**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the first condition: `X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.0`
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the second condition if the first condition is **True** (Left Branch): `X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'`
  - `nodes[2]`: Represents the truth value of the second condition if the first condition is **False** (Right Branch): `X['pension'] != 'none'`
  - Unused nodes in a branch are set to `None`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Split (`nodes[0]`):**
     - Checks if the **wage increase in the first year** is **less than or equal to 4%**.
     - `nodes[0] = 1` if condition is satisfied, else `nodes[0] = 0`.
  
  2. **Second Level Split:**
     - **Left Branch (when `nodes[0] = 1`):**
       - Checks if the **employer's contribution towards the health plan** is **'full'**.
       - `nodes[1] = 1` if condition is satisfied, else `nodes[1] = 0`.
       - **Outcome:**
         - If `nodes[1] = 1`, prediction is `1` (GOOD).
         - If `nodes[1] = 0`, prediction is `0` (BAD).
     - **Right Branch (when `nodes[0] = 0`):**
       - Checks if the **employer contributions to the pension plan** is **not 'none'**.
       - `nodes[2] = 1` if condition is satisfied (`'pension'` is `'ret_allw'` or `'empl_contr'`), else `nodes[2] = 0`.
       - **Outcome:**
         - If `nodes[2] = 1`, prediction is `1` (GOOD).
         - If `nodes[2] = 0`, prediction is `0` (BAD).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 2.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37.5,
    'pension': 'ret_allw',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 11,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': False,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'GOOD' if prediction == 1 else 'BAD'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: GOOD
Nodes: [1, 1, None]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: Wage increase in the first year is <= 4%.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: Employer's contribution towards health plan is 'full'.
  - `nodes[2] = None`: Not evaluated in this branch.
  - **Result:** Outcome is **GOOD**.

**Note on Feature Values:**

Ensure that the feature values in the input dictionary `X` match the expected types and encodings:

- **Numeric Features:**
  - `'wage increase first year'`: Float (2.0 .. 7.0)
- **Categorical Features:**
  - `'pension'`: String (`'none'`, `'ret_allw'`, `'empl_contr'`)
  - `'contribution to health plan'`: String (`'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **Prediction Values:**
  - `0`: BAD outcome
  - `1`: GOOD outcome

---

**Summary:**

- The function `predict` classifies the outcome of labor negotiations as **GOOD** or **BAD** based on the most significant features.
- It returns:
  - `prediction`: The classification result (0 or 1).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` or `0`) for the conditions evaluated at each inner node of the decision tree.
