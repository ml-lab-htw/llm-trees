```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    avg_wage_increase = (X['wage increase first year'] + X['wage increase second year'] + X['wage increase third year']) / 3

    nodes[0] = X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'none'
    nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] in ['none', 'half']


    if nodes[0]:
        if avg_wage_increase <= 4.5:  # Threshold for average wage increase
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:  # Cost of living adjustment is NOT none
        if nodes[1]: #Health plan is none or half
            prediction = 0
        else: #Health plan is full
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Average Wage Increase Calculation:** The code now calculates the average wage increase across the three years.  This provides a more comprehensive measure of wage improvement than considering individual years separately.

2. **Thresholds:**  A reasonable threshold of 4.5 has been added for the average wage increase.  This value would ideally be determined through analysis of real-world data or expert input.  Similarly, the health plan contributions are categorized.

3. **List of Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) for each decision node, as requested.

4. **Feature Access:** The code now uses the correct feature names provided in the prompt (e.g., `'cost of living adjustment'`,  `'wage increase first year'`, etc.)

5. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability, with comments explaining the logic.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.0,
    'wage increase second year': 4.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none' 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Bad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True] (Meaning both conditions were met)

X['cost of living adjustment'] = 'tc'
X['contribution to health plan'] = 'full'
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Good)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False] (Meaning neither condition was met)
```


This improved function provides a clearer and more functional implementation of the decision tree logic, adhering to the specified format and using meaningful thresholds. Remember that these thresholds are illustrative and should be tuned with actual data for a real-world application.
