Here is the Python function based on the given decision tree and features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if wage increase in first year is less than or equal to 3.5%
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.5

    # Node 1: This node is only evaluated if Node 0 is False
    if not nodes[0]:
        # Check if cost of living adjustment is 'none'
        nodes[1] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "none"
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated when Node 0 is True

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad Outcome
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Bad Outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Good Outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:**
  - We initialize a list `nodes` with two elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  
- **Node Evaluations:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if `"wage increase first year"` is less than or equal to `3.5`. This corresponds to the root of the decision tree.
    - If this condition is **True**, we predict a **Bad Outcome** (`0`), and there's no need to evaluate Node 1.
    - If this condition is **False**, we proceed to evaluate Node 1.
  - **Node 1:** Evaluated only if Node 0 is **False**. It checks if `"cost of living adjustment"` is equal to `"none"`.
    - If this condition is **True**, we predict a **Bad Outcome** (`0`).
    - If this condition is **False**, we predict a **Good Outcome** (`1`).
  - If Node 0 is **True**, we set `nodes[1]` to `None` since Node 1 is not evaluated in this path.

- **Prediction:**
  - The `prediction` variable holds the final classification:
    - `0` for **Bad Outcome**.
    - `1` for **Good Outcome**.

- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns a tuple containing the `prediction` and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Note on Feature Values:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys as specified:
  - `"wage increase first year"`: A numeric value representing the wage increase percentage in the first year (e.g., `3.0`).
  - `"cost of living adjustment"`: A string value, which can be `"none"`, `"tcf"` (temporary cost of living adjustment formula), or `"tc"` (total compensation adjustment).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where wage increase is 3.0% and cost of living adjustment is 'none'
X_input = {
    "wage increase first year": 3.0,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this decision tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_input)
print("Prediction:", "Good Outcome" if prediction == 1 else "Bad Outcome")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Bad Outcome
Nodes Truth Values: [True, None]
```
