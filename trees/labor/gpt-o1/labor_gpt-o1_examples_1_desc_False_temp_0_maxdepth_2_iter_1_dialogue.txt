    nodes[0] = avg_wage_increase <= 4.5  # Threshold for average wage increase
    nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'  # Health plan contribution for the second split


    if nodes[0]:
        if X['cost of living adjustment'] == 'none':
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Still likely 'bad' with low wage increase even with COLA
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Still likely 'good' with higher wage increase even without full health plan


    return prediction, [int(n) for n in nodes] # Convert boolean nodes to integers




```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Average Wage Increase:** The code calculates the average wage increase across the three years, as this is a more informative feature than the individual year increases.

2. **Thresholds:**  I've set a threshold of 4.5 for the average wage increase. This could be adjusted based on domain knowledge or analysis of real data.

3. **Cost of Living and Health Plan:**  The cost of living adjustment and health plan contribution are used as secondary splitting criteria, as outlined in the previous response.

4. **Boolean to Integer Conversion:**  The `nodes` list is explicitly converted to integers (0 or 1) as required.

5. **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is structured to be more readable and follows Python conventions.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.0,
    'wage increase second year': 4.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': False,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```


This improved function provides a more practical and complete solution to the problem, including clear feature handling, thresholding, and conversion to the required output format. Remember that the chosen thresholds and splitting criteria are examples, and would need to be optimized with actual data and model training.
