Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the specified features, here is the Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Only one decision node in the tree (depth = 1)

    # Node 0: Check if the wage increase in the first year is less than 5.0%
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["wage increase first year"] < 5.0 else 0

    # Make the prediction based on the value of node 0
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Features Used:**
  - `"wage increase first year"`: This is the most important feature for predicting the negotiation outcome.

- **Threshold Chosen:**
  - The threshold of **5.0%** is selected based on domain knowledge, where a wage increase of 5% or more is considered favorable (good outcome), and less than 5% is less favorable (bad outcome).

- **Inner Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]` stores the truth value of the condition:
    - `1` if the condition `X["wage increase first year"] < 5.0` is **true**.
    - `0` if the condition is **false**.

- **Prediction:**
  - If `nodes[0] == 1` (condition is true), the prediction is `0` (bad outcome).
  - If `nodes[0] == 0` (condition is false), the prediction is `1` (good outcome).

### Usage Example:

Here's how you might use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 4.5,
    "wage increase second year": 4.0,
    "wage increase third year": 4.0,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    "working hours": 37.5,
    "pension": "empl_contr",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": False,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}

# Get prediction and node values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Good" if prediction == 1 else "Bad")
print("Node Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bad
Node Values: [1]
```

### Notes:

- **Feature Names:**
  - Ensure that the keys in your input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature names provided:
    ```python
    [
        'duration', 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year',
        'wage increase third year', 'cost of living adjustment', 'working hours',
        'pension', 'standby pay', 'shift differential', 'education allowance',
        'statutory holidays', 'vacation', 'longterm disability assistance',
        'contribution to dental plan', 'bereavement assistance', 'contribution to health plan'
    ]
    ```

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - The target variable is encoded as:
    - `0` for **Bad** outcome.
    - `1` for **Good** outcome.

- **Threshold Value:**
  - The threshold of `5.0` for `"wage increase first year"` is chosen to meaningfully split the outcomes based on reasonable expectations in labor negotiations.

- **Inner Nodes List:**
  - The `nodes` list contains binary values representing whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied:
    - `1` if the condition is **true**.
    - `0` if the condition is **false**.

### Decision Tree Representation:

This function represents the following decision tree (maximum depth of 1):

```
|--- wage increase first year < 5.0
     |--- Outcome: Bad (0)
|--- wage increase first year >= 5.0
     |--- Outcome: Good (1)
```

### Additional Considerations:

- **Data Types:**
  - Ensure that the value for `"wage increase first year"` in the input `X` is a numeric type (e.g., `float` or `int`) for the comparison to work correctly.

- **Extensibility:**
  - This simple function can be extended to include more conditions by increasing the depth of the tree and adding more nodes if needed.

- **Error Handling:**
  - For robustness, you may want to add error handling to check that all required features are present in the input `X` and that they have valid values.

### Conclusion:

By using the most significant feature and a meaningful threshold, this function provides a straightforward way to predict the outcome of labor negotiations as **good** or **bad**, reflecting the decision tree structure described.
