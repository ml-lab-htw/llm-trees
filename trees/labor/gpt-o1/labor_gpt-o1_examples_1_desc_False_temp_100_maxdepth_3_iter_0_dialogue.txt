Sure! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree you provided. It returns a single prediction (`0` for "bad" and `1` for "good") and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Wage increase in first year <= 3.5
    nodes[0] = int(X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.5)

    # Node 1: Employer's contribution towards the health plan == 'full'
    nodes[1] = int(X["contribution to health plan"] == 'full')

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Class 'bad'
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Class 'good'
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Class 'bad'

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- We initialize a list `nodes` with `None` values to store the truth values of each inner node in the decision tree.
- **Node 0** checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to `3.5`. If so, it sets `nodes[0]` to `1`; otherwise, `0`.
- **Node 1** checks if the employer's contribution towards the health plan is `'full'`. If so, it sets `nodes[1]` to `1`; otherwise, `0`.
- The decision logic follows the structure of the decision tree:

  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition is satisfied), the prediction is `0` (class `'bad'`).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (condition is not satisfied):
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1`, the prediction is `1` (class `'good'`).
    - If `nodes[1]` is `0`, the prediction is `0` (class `'bad'`).
- The function returns the `prediction` and the list of `nodes`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input feature dictionary
X_sample = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 40,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'false',
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'none',
    'bereavement assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {'good' if prediction == 1 else 'bad'}")
print(f"Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: good
Inner Nodes Truth Values: [0, 1]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `0` because `wage increase first year` (4.0) is not less than or equal to `3.5`.
- `nodes[1]` is `1` because `contribution to health plan` is `'full'`.
- The prediction is `'good'` based on the decision tree logic.

**Note:** Ensure that the feature values in the input dictionary `X` match the expected data types and encodings specified:

- **Numerical Features:**

  - `'duration'`: Integer between 1 and 7
  - `'wage increase first year'`: Float between 2.0 and 7.0
  - `'wage increase second year'`: Float between 2.0 and 7.0
  - `'wage increase third year'`: Float between 2.0 and 7.0
  - `'working hours'`: Integer between 35 and 40
  - `'standby pay'`: Integer between 2 and 25
  - `'shift differential'`: Integer between 1 and 25
  - `'statutory holidays'`: Integer between 9 and 15

- **Categorical Features:**

  - `'cost of living adjustment'`: `'none'`, `'tcf'`, `'tc'`
  - `'pension'`: `'none'`, `'ret_allw'`, `'empl_contr'`
  - `'education allowance'`: `'true'` or `'false'`
  - `'vacation'`: `'ba'`, `'avg'`, `'gnr'`
  - `'longterm disability assistance'`: `'true'` or `'false'`
  - `'contribution to dental plan'`: `'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`
  - `'bereavement assistance'`: `'true'` or `'false'`
  - `'contribution to health plan'`: `'none'`, `'half'`, `'full'`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: `'bad'`
- `1`: `'good'`

Feel free to adjust the input values according to your data, and use the function to make predictions based on the decision tree.
