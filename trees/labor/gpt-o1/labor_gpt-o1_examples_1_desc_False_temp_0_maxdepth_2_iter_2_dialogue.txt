**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Average Wage Increase:** The code now calculates the average wage increase across the three years, as this is likely more informative than individual year increases for a simplified tree.
* **Thresholds:**  I've added a reasonable threshold of 4.5 for the average wage increase. This would need to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis.
* **COLA and Health Plan:**  The tree now uses the COLA and health plan contributions as the primary decision points, followed by average wage increase as secondary, as per our initial assumptions.
* **Clearer Comments:**  The code includes comments to clarify the logic.
* **Example Usage:** Added an example of how to use the `predict` function.



This improved version provides a more functional and interpretable decision tree, addressing the requested format and incorporating more meaningful logic based on the feature descriptions. Remember that this is a demonstration;  a real-world application requires training a decision tree model on actual data using a library like scikit-learn.  You'd also evaluate the model's performance and potentially adjust its complexity (depth, feature selection, etc.) to optimize its accuracy.
