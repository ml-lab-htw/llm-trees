**Key improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Access:** Uses the provided feature keys directly (e.g., `X['wage increase first year']`).
* **Total Wage Increase Calculation:** Computes the total wage increase as a combined feature.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  Uses 12.0 as the threshold for total wage increase. You can adjust this based on domain knowledge or data analysis.
* **COLA Check:** Directly checks if `cost of living adjustment` is 'tc' (total compensation).
* **Node List Conversion:** Converts the `nodes` list to integers (0 or 1) before returning.
* **Example Usage:** Provides examples of how to call the `predict` function.


This improved function is more robust, easier to understand, and adheres to the provided specifications.  Remember, you'll need real-world data and a training process to determine the optimal thresholds and feature splits for a truly effective decision tree.
