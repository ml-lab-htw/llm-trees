```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Initialize a list for truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.0%
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"wage increase first year"`: Wage increase in the first year of the contract, ranging from 2.0% to 7.0%.
- **Threshold Chosen:**
  - `4.0%`: A meaningful value within the given range to separate "bad" and "good" outcomes.

**Function Details:**

- **Input:**
  - `X`: A dictionary with feature keys as specified.
- **Process:**
  - **Node 0 Condition:** `X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0`
    - If the wage increase in the first year is **4.0% or less**, it's considered a **bad** outcome.
    - If the wage increase is **more than 4.0%**, it's considered a **good** outcome.
- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: `0` for bad, `1` for good.
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value of the inner node condition (`True` or `False`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input features
X_sample = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 5.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37.5,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")  # Output: Node Truth Values: [False]
```

In this example, since the wage increase in the first year is `5.0%` (which is greater than `4.0%`), the outcome is predicted to be **good** (`1`).

Feel free to adjust the threshold or use a different feature based on the specific data or preferences.
