Sure! Based on the decision tree provided and the specific feature keys, here's the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier. This function will return the prediction (0 = Bad, 1 = Good) and a list indicating the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.0
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Bad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the **wage increase in the first year** is less than or equal to **3.0%**.
  - `nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.0`
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if the **employer's contribution towards the health plan** is **full**.
  - `nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"`

**Decision Logic:**

1. **First Split:** Based on `nodes[0]` (wage increase in the first year).
   - If `nodes[0]` is **True** (wage increase â‰¤ 3.0%), the prediction is **0** (Bad outcome).
   - Else, proceed to the second split.

2. **Second Split:** Based on `nodes[1]` (employer's health plan contribution).
   - If `nodes[1]` is **True** (contribution is "full"), the prediction is **1** (Good outcome).
   - Else, the prediction is **0** (Bad outcome).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where wage increase is 2.5% and health plan contribution is "full"
X_example = {
    "wage increase first year": 2.5,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Bad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```

**Notes:**

- Make sure that the input dictionary `X` contains at least the keys:
  - `"wage increase first year"`
  - `"contribution to health plan"`
- The function assumes that:
  - `"wage increase first year"` is a numeric value representing the percentage increase.
  - `"contribution to health plan"` is a string with possible values: `"none"`, `"half"`, `"full"`.

**Feature Keys (for reference):**

- `'duration'`
- `'wage increase first year'`
- `'wage increase second year'`
- `'wage increase third year'`
- `'cost of living adjustment'`
- `'working hours'`
- `'pension'`
- `'standby pay'`
- `'shift differential'`
- `'education allowance'`
- `'statutory holidays'`
- `'vacation'`
- `'longterm disability assistance'`
- `'contribution to dental plan'`
- `'bereavement assistance'`
- `'contribution to health plan'`

**Target Variable:**

- **target:** Final settlements in labor negotiations in Canadian industry
  - `0` = **Bad**
  - `1` = **Good**
