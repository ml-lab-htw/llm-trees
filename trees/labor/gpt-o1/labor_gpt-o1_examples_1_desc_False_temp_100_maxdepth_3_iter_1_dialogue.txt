Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict` that implements the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 3. The function returns a single prediction (`0` for "bad", `1` for "good") and a list representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = int(X["pension"] == 0)
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = int(X["contribution to dental plan"] == 0)
            prediction = 0  # Outcome: bad
        else:
            nodes[2] = int(X["contribution to health plan"] == "full")
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Outcome: good
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Outcome: bad
    else:
        nodes[1] = int(X["contribution to health plan"] == "full")
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Outcome: good
        else:
            nodes[2] = int(X["vacation"] == "gnr")  # 'gnr' stands for 'generous'
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Outcome: good
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Outcome: bad
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used (exact spelling):**
  - `"wage increase first year"`
  - `"pension"`
  - `"contribution to dental plan"`
  - `"contribution to health plan"`
  - `"vacation"`

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates the condition `wage increase first year <= 4.0`.
  - `nodes[1]` and `nodes[2]`: Subsequent conditions based on the decision path.

- The function utilizes `int` to convert boolean values (`True` or `False`) to `1` or `0` respectively.

**Decision Tree Structure:**

```
|--- wage increase first year <= 4.0
    |--- pension == 0
        |--- contribution to dental plan == 0
            |--- class: bad (0)
        |--- contribution to dental plan != 0
            |--- class: bad (0)
    |--- pension != 0
        |--- contribution to health plan == 'full'
            |--- class: good (1)
        |--- contribution to health plan != 'full'
            |--- class: bad (0)
|--- wage increase first year > 4.0
    |--- contribution to health plan == 'full'
        |--- class: good (1)
    |--- contribution to health plan != 'full'
        |--- vacation == 'gnr'  # gnr = generous
            |--- class: good (1)
        |--- vacation != 'gnr'
            |--- class: bad (0)
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature values
X_example = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 5.0,
    "wage increase second year": 3.0,
    "wage increase third year": 2.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": "true",
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "gnr",
    "longterm disability assistance": "false",
    "contribution to dental plan": "full",
    "bereavement assistance": "true",
    "contribution to health plan": "half"
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the result
print(f"Prediction: {'good' if prediction == 1 else 'bad'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Notes on Feature Values:**

- **Numerical Features:**
  - `"wage increase first year"`: Float value between `2.0` and `7.0`.

- **Categorical Features (use exact strings as specified):**
  - `"pension"`: `"none"`, `"ret_allw"`, or `"empl_contr"`.
  - `"contribution to dental plan"` and `"contribution to health plan"`: `"none"`, `"half"`, or `"full"`.
  - `"vacation"`: `"ba"` (below average), `"avg"` (average), or `"gnr"` (generous).

- **Boolean Features (use strings `"true"` or `"false"`):**
  - `"education allowance"`
  - `"longterm disability assistance"`
  - `"bereavement assistance"`

**Interpretation of Nodes:**

- `nodes[0]`:
  - `1` if `wage increase first year <= 4.0`.
  - `0` if `wage increase first year > 4.0`.

- `nodes[1]` and `nodes[2]`:
  - Depend on the path taken from `nodes[0]`.

**Function Logic:**

- **If `wage increase first year` is less than or equal to `4.0%`**:
  - **Node 1**: Check if `pension` is `"none"`.
    - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`):
      - **Node 2**: Check `contribution to dental plan` (though outcome is always `"bad"` in this branch).
      - **Prediction**: `0` ("bad").
    - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`):
      - **Node 2**: Check if `contribution to health plan` is `"full"`.
        - If **yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`): **Prediction**: `1` ("good").
        - If **no** (`nodes[2] = 0`): **Prediction**: `0` ("bad").
  
- **If `wage increase first year` is greater than `4.0%`**:
  - **Node 1**: Check if `contribution to health plan` is `"full"`.
    - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`): **Prediction**: `1` ("good").
    - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`):
      - **Node 2**: Check if `vacation` is `"gnr"` (generous).
        - If **yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`): **Prediction**: `1` ("good").
        - If **no** (`nodes[2] = 0`): **Prediction**: `0` ("bad").

**Key Points:**

- The function strictly adheres to the exact feature keys and their spelling as provided.
- Conditions are designed to reflect the most significant features in determining the negotiation outcome.
- The decision tree prioritizes **wage increases**, **employer contributions**, and **vacation benefits**.

**Ensure Correct Data Types:**

- Provide numerical values where required (e.g., wage increases as `float`).
- Use exact strings for categorical features.
- Represent boolean features as strings `"true"` or `"false"`.

**Summary:**

- **Prediction**: Returns `0` for "bad" and `1` for "good".
- **Nodes**: A list `[nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2]]`, where each element is `1` if the condition is satisfied or `0` otherwise.

By using this function, you can classify the outcome of labor negotiations based on the most impactful features up to a maximum depth of 3 in the decision tree.
