Let's create a Python function to predict the outcome of labor negotiations using the decision tree we derived earlier. We'll also include the truth values of the inner nodes as requested.

Here is the derived decision tree logic:
1. Check if the wage increase in the first year of the contract is less than or equal to 3.
    - If true, the outcome is "bad."
2. If false, check if there is an education allowance.
    - If true, the outcome is "good."
    - If false, the outcome is "bad."

We'll consider this logic to create the function `predict`.

### Python Function

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3
    nodes[1] = X["education allowance"] == "true"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_1 = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 2.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'ret_allw',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'false',
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

example_2 = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 4,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'true',
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'ba',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

print(predict(example_1))  # Output: (0, [True, False])
print(predict(example_2))  # Output: (1, [False, True])
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains all the features described.
2. The function initializes a list `nodes` with two `None` values to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. The first condition checks if `"wage increase first year"` is less than or equal to 3.
   - If this condition is true (`nodes[0]`), the outcome is "bad" (`prediction = 0`).
4. If the first condition is false (`nodes[0] = False`), the second condition checks if `"education allowance"` is "true".
   - If this condition is true (`nodes[1]`), the outcome is "good" (`prediction = 1`).
   - Otherwise, the outcome is "bad" (`prediction = 0`).

This function can be extended and improved with more depth and conditions based on further data analysis and optimization.
