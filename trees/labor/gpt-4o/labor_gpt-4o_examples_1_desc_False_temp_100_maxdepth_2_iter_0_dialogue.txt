def predict(X: dict):

    # Define the decision tree's condition checks for the inner nodes.
    # Node 0: Check if wage increase in first year is <= 4.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    # Node 1: Subsequent check depending on the first condition.
    # If first condition is True, check contribution to health plan.
    # If first condition is False, check vacation days.
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # Wage increase first year <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Contribution to health plan is "none"
            prediction = 0  # "bad"
        else:
            prediction = 1  # "good"
    else:  # Wage increase first year > 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Vacation is "ba" (below average)
            prediction = 0  # "bad"

            prediction = 1  # "good"

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the conditions.
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input:** The function assumes a dictionary `X` where the keys are feature names given in the prompt and the values are their corresponding values.

   - For example:
     ```
     X = {
         'wage increase first year': 3.5,
         'contribution to health plan': 'none',
         'vacation': 'avg'
     }
     ```

2. **Nodes List:**
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision condition (root node of the tree).
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision condition based on the split at the root node.

3. **Logic:**
   - The root node checks if the "wage increase in first year" is less than or equal to 4.5. If true, it proceeds to check the "contribution to health plan." If false, it checks the "vacation" feature.
   - Depending on these conditions, the tree predicts either `0` (bad) or `1` (good).

4. **Return Values:**
   - `prediction` is either `0` or `1`, corresponding to "bad" or "good."
   - `nodes` is a list of truth values (`True` or `False`) for the inner node conditions for interpretability or debugging.

This function is a fully self-contained implementation of the decision tree described in your original prompt.
