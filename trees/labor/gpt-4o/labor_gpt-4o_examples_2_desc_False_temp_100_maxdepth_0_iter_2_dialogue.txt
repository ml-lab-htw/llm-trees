To implement a decision tree classifier based on the provided features for predicting whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad and returning both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes, we first need to construct the decision tree based on one or multiple important features.

### Decision Tree Construction:
Given the provided features and constraints, we'll use the specific features to form conditions in the decision tree.

Here's how the decision tree could be represented in Python:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Employer's financial contribution towards the costs of bereavement
    nodes[0] = X['bereavement assistance'] == 'true'
    
    # Node 1: Employer's contribution towards the health plan
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'full'

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            # Node 2: Standby pay <= 10
            nodes[2] = X['standby pay'] <= 10

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Bad outcome

    else:
        # Node 3: Number of paid vacation days
        nodes[3] = X['vacation'] == 'gnr'

        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            # Node 4: Check if the vacation days are average
            nodes[4] = X['vacation'] == 'avg'

            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 4.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 12,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'true',
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': 'false',
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'good' if prediction == 1 else 'bad'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function, we:
1. Initialize a list `nodes` to store values of inner nodes.
2. Fill in the conditions for each node by checking `X` (the input dictionary with feature values).
3. Traverse the decision tree structure to make a prediction (`1` for good, `0` for bad).
4. Return the prediction and the values of the inner nodes as a list.

### Explanation of Feature Decisions:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the employer contributes financially towards covering bereavement costs (`true` or `false`).
2. **Node 1**: When bereavement assistance is true, it checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is `full`.
3. **Node 2**: For partial health plan contributions, it checks if standby pay is less than or equal to `10`.
4. **Node 3**: When bereavement assistance is false, it checks if the number of paid vacation days is `gnr` (generous).
5. **Node 4**: If vacation days are not generous, it checks if they are `avg` (average).

This structured approach uses key features assumed to be important for labor negotiations and translates them into actionable decisions in the Python function.
