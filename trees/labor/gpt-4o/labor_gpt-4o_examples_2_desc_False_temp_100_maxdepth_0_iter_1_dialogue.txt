To format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, we'll follow the structure provided in the examples. I'll build the function based on the decision tree provided earlier.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5

    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "none"
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 3
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == "none"
    nodes[3] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    nodes[4] = X["wage increase first year"] > 4.0

    # Root node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        # First split
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            # Second split
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:
                # Third split
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # bad
                else:
                    # Final decision
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'duration': 4,
    'wage increase first year': 5.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 40,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print('Prediction:', 'good' if prediction == 1 else 'bad')
print('Nodes:', nodes)
```

In this function:
1. We set up the node conditions based on the critical decision points from the decision tree.
2. The tree structure is followed to assign the value to each node.
3. The prediction is made based on the truth values of the nodes.
4. The function returns both the prediction and the node values. 

This provides a clear structure and ensures that we can diagnose how each feature contributes to the final outcome.
