Here’s how you can create a Python function for the decision tree based on the labor negotiations dataset and features provided. The function will predict whether the labor negotiation outcome is "good" (1) or "bad" (0) and return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the outcome of labor negotiations based on input features.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing feature values. Keys are:
                  'duration', 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year',
                  'wage increase third year', 'cost of living adjustment', 'working hours',
                  'pension', 'standby pay', 'shift differential', 'education allowance',
                  'statutory holidays', 'vacation', 'longterm disability assistance',
                  'contribution to dental plan', 'bereavement assistance',
                  'contribution to health plan'

    Returns:
        (int, list): Prediction (0 = bad, 1 = good) and truth values of inner nodes.
    """

    # Initialize list of truth values for inner nodes
    nodes = []

    # Node 0: Wage increase in the first year of contract <= 4.5
    nodes.append(X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If wage increase in the first year <= 4.5
        prediction = 0  # bad
    else:  # If wage increase in the first year > 4.5
        prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Here’s an example of how the function can be used with an input dictionary:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
features = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 5.0,  # Greater than 4.5
    "wage increase second year": 4.0,
    "wage increase third year": 3.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": False,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (good)
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Truth values of inner nodes: [False]
```

### Explanation:
1. The function focuses on the **"wage increase first year"** feature because it was determined to be the most important feature to classify the outcome of labor negotiations.
2. A wage increase of more than 4.5% is assumed to lead to "good" negotiations (class 1), while 4.5% or less leads to "bad" negotiations (class 0).
3. The `nodes` list contains the truth value of the condition evaluated at the first decision node (inner node):
    - `True` means the condition was satisfied.
    - `False` means the condition was not satisfied.

The structure of the function allows it to handle modifications and expansions easily if a deeper tree or additional nodes are required.
