Given the features and the target variable specifications, let's write a Python function that uses a decision tree to classify whether the outcome of labor negotiations is good or bad. The function will also return a list of truth values for inner nodes:

### Python Function

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # evaluate the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    nodes[2] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "none"
    nodes[3] = X["cost of living adjustment"] in ["tcf", "tc"]
    
    # decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # 'good'
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # 'good'
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # 'bad'
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # 'good'
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # 'bad'
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "duration": 5,
    "wage increase first year": 4,
    "wage increase second year": 4,
    "wage increase third year": 4,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 5,
    "shift differential": 20,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "full",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full",
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'good' if prediction == 1 else 'bad'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- The `nodes` list contains boolean values representing whether each condition is met or not.
- The first condition checks whether the number of paid vacation days (`vacation`) is `gnr` (generous).
- The second condition checks if the `contribution to health plan` is `full`.
- The third condition checks if the `cost of living adjustment` is `none`.
- The fourth checks if the `cost of living adjustment` is either `tcf` (temporary cost of living) or `tc` (total compensation).

### Note:
- The decision thresholds and logic were derived from the example decision tree provided earlier. For a real-world scenario, a proper analysis with a data-driven approach would be essential to determine these thresholds.
