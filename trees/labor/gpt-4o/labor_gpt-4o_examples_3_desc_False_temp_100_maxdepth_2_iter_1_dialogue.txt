To create a function based on the provided decision tree for labor negotiations with a depth of 2, we need to structure it accordingly. I'll assume the two features that have been identified as important ("wage increase first year" and "contribution to health plan") for our decision tree.

Here is a complete Python function that returns a prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 'full' if nodes[0] else X["contribution to health plan"] != 'none'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 4.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 4.5,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

# Call the function
prediction, node_truth_values = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {node_truth_values}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes Calculation:**
  - `nodes[0]` checks if the "wage increase first year" is less than or equal to 3.5.
  - `nodes[1]` checks "contribution to health plan":
    - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (wage increase first year is â‰¤ 3.5), then it checks if the contribution to health plan is "full".
    - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (wage increase first year is > 3.5), then it checks if the contribution to health plan is not "none".

The function returns the predicted class (0 for "bad", 1 for "good") and a list containing the truth values of the inner nodes. This way, you can trace which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process.
