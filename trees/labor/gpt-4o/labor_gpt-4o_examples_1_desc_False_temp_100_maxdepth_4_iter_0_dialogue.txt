Below is the Python function representing the decision tree for the given problem. It takes a dictionary `X` with keys corresponding to the provided feature names, applies the decision tree, and returns a prediction as well as the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Decision Tree Function
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Root decision
    nodes[0] = X["duration"] <= 3.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Left branch
        # Node 1
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
        if nodes[1]:  # Left branch
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # Right branch
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # Right branch
        # Node 2
        nodes[2] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
        if nodes[2]:  # Left branch
            # Node 3
            nodes[3] = X["vacation"] == 1  # ba = below average
            if nodes[3]:  # Left branch
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # Right branch
                prediction = 1  # good
        else:  # Right branch
            # Node 4
            nodes[3] = X["contribution to dental plan"] == 0
            if nodes[3]:  # Left branch
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # Right branch
                prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each condition in the tree (e.g., `X["duration"] <= 3.5`) is represented by an entry in the `nodes` list. A `True` or `False` value is stored for each decision.
2. **Conditions**:
    - Node 0: Split by `duration`. Agreements lasting 3.5 years or less are more likely to lead to bad outcomes.
    - Node 1: If `duration` is <= 3.5, check `contribution to health plan`. If it is `"none"`, the outcome is bad; otherwise, it is good.
    - Node 2: If `duration` is > 3.5, check `wage increase first year`. If the wage increase is <= 4.5%, there is an additional split.
    - Node 3: If `wage increase first year` is <= 4.5, check `vacation`. Agreements with below-average vacation lead to bad outcomes; otherwise, they lead to good outcomes.
    - Node 4: If `wage increase first year` is > 4.5, check `contribution to dental plan`. If it is `"none"`, the outcome is bad; otherwise, it is good.

3. **Outputs**:
    - `prediction`: 0 for `bad`, 1 for `good`.
    - `nodes`: A list of truth values ([True/False, True/False, ...]) for the inner decision nodes, which helps trace the decisions made.

### Example Usage:
Here's an example of how to use the function:

```python
example = {
    "duration": 4,
    "wage increase first year": 4,
    "wage increase second year": 5,
    "wage increase third year": 5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": False,
    "statutory holidays": 10,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "full",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "none"
}

pred, nodes = predict(example)
print("Prediction:", "good" if pred == 1 else "bad")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
```
Prediction: good
Node Truth Values: [False, None, True, False]
```

This output indicates that the prediction is "good" and the truth values for the evaluation of the inner nodes were `[False, None, True, False]`, where `None` means the node was not evaluated (as the branch leading to that node was not taken).
