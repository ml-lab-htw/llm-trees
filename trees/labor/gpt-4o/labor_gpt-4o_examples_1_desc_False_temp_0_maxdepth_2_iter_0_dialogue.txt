Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts whether the outcome of labor negotiations is "good" (1) or "bad" (0) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations (0 = bad, 1 = good) based on input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted class (0 = bad, 1 = good).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if "wage increase first year" <= 4.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If "wage increase first year" <= 4.5
        # Node 1: Check if "contribution to health plan" == 0
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
        if nodes[1]:  # If "contribution to health plan" == 0
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # If "contribution to health plan" != 0
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # If "wage increase first year" > 4.5
        # Node 1: Check if "vacation" == 1 (below average)
        nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # If "vacation" == 1
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # If "vacation" != 1
            prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (e.g., `"wage increase first year"`, `"contribution to health plan"`, etc.), and the values are the corresponding feature values.

2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree:
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether the condition at the root node (`"wage increase first year" <= 4.5`) is satisfied.
   - `nodes[1]`: Whether the condition at the second level of the tree is satisfied, depending on the path taken.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The root node checks if `"wage increase first year" <= 4.5`.
   - If true, the second node checks if `"contribution to health plan" == 0`.
   - If false, the second node checks if `"vacation" == 1` (below average).

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = bad, 1 = good).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 4.0,
    "wage increase second year": 3.5,
    "wage increase third year": 3.0,
    "cost of living adjustment": "none",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "ret_allw",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 5,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "none"
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (bad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Example Output:
For the input above:
- `"wage increase first year" <= 4.5` is `True` (node 0).
- `"contribution to health plan" == 0` is `True` (node 1).
- The prediction is `0` (bad).
