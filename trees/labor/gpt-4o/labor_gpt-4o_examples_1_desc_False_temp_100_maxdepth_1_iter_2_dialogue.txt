Here is the Python function based on your specified features and requirements. This function implements the depth-1 decision tree using the feature `wage increase first year`, which was identified as the most important feature. The function returns the prediction (0 = bad, 1 = good) and a list of truth values representing whether each decision node's condition was satisfied.

### Python Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the outcome of labor negotiations (0 = bad, 1 = good) based on the features provided.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary of input features. 
        Keys must match the exact feature names:
        ['duration', 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year', 
         'wage increase third year', 'cost of living adjustment', 'working hours', 
         'pension', 'standby pay', 'shift differential', 'education allowance', 
         'statutory holidays', 'vacation', 'longterm disability assistance', 
         'contribution to dental plan', 'bereavement assistance', 
         'contribution to health plan']
         
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 for "bad," 1 for "good."
        - nodes (list): A list of boolean values indicating whether each decision node's condition was satisfied.
    """
    # Nodes list (only one node in this depth-1 tree)
    nodes = [None]
    
    # Evaluate the condition at the root node
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5  # Threshold set to 4.5
    
    # Make prediction based on the condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # "bad"
    else:
        prediction = 1  # "good"
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Here's an example of how you would use this function to make a prediction:

```python
# Example feature input for a labor negotiation
features = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 4.0,
    "wage increase second year": 5.0,
    "wage increase third year": 3.5,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "none",
    "standby pay": 10,
    "shift differential": 2,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": True,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

# Output results
print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the above input:
```plaintext
Prediction: bad
Nodes truth values: [True]
```

### Explanation:
- `nodes[0]` is `True` because the value of `"wage increase first year"` (4.0) is less than or equal to 4.5.
- Based on the decision tree, this results in a prediction of `0` ("bad").
