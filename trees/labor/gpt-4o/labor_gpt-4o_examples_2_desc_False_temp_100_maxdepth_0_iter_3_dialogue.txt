Sure, let's construct a Python function that makes use of the decision tree structure we defined earlier and follows the coding pattern of the examples you provided. The function will take a dictionary of features as input and return a prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    nodes[0] = X["vacation"] == "ba"
    nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == "avg"
    nodes[2] = X["working hours"] <= 37
    nodes[3] = X["shift differential"] <= 10
    nodes[4] = X["cost of living adjustment"] == "none"

    if nodes[0]:
        # If 'vacation' is below average (bad)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If 'vacation' is average (neutral)
            prediction = 0  # Placeholder for neutral, as the examples define only 'good' and 'bad'
        else:
            if X["vacation"] == "gnr":
                # If 'vacation' is generous (good)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[2]:
                    # If 'working hours' are 37 or less (good)
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    if nodes[3]:
                        # If 'shift differential' is 10 or less (neutral)
                        prediction = 0  # Placeholder, see note above
                    else:
                        # If 'shift differential' is more than 10 (bad)
                        prediction = 0
        
        if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
            if nodes[4]:
                # If 'cost of living adjustment' is none (bad)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                if X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tcf":
                    # If 'cost of living adjustment' is temporary (neutral)
                    prediction = 0  # Placeholder, see note above
                elif X["cost of living adjustment"] == "tc":
                    # If 'cost of living adjustment' is total compensation (good)
                    prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tc',
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': 'empl_contr',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 12,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'gnr',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
    'bereavement assistance': False,
    'contribution to health plan': 'full'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Good' if prediction == 1 else 'Bad'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function:

- The tree first checks the 'vacation' feature.
- Then it checks 'working hours' if 'vacation' is not below average.
- It moves to 'shift differential' to categorize based on the working conditions.
- Finally, it considers 'cost of living adjustment' for further fine-grained categorization.

This code is designed to reflect a simplified decision tree based on prioritizing certain features which seemed important. The prediction and nodes values are printed at the end. You can adjust thresholds and categories as per your specific dataset requirements.
