Based on the problem description, here is the Python function for a decision tree with depth 1 that classifies “Final settlements in labor negotiations” as good (1) or bad (0), using the most significant feature: `wage increase first year`. The condition used is `wage increase first year <= 4.5`, as established previously.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to store the truth values of inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree's first condition (root node)
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    
    # Prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # good
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1 **Function Inputs:**
   - `X` is a dictionary where the keys are feature names (e.g., `"wage increase first year"`) and the values are their corresponding observations (e.g., `4.0`).

2 **Logic:**
   - The root condition is whether `wage increase first year` is less than or equal to `4.5`. If this condition is satisfied, the settlement outcome is classified as `"bad"` (0). Otherwise, it is classified as `"good"` (1).
   - This feature, threshold, and condition were chosen because it was deemed the most important based on example logic and domain knowledge.

3 **Outputs:**
   - `prediction`: The classification result, either `0` (bad) or `1` (good).
   - `nodes`: A list where each entry represents whether the corresponding condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false). Here, as the tree has depth 1, `nodes` contains a single value.

### Example Usage:

Suppose we have the following input features:

```python
X = {
    "duration": 3,
    "wage increase first year": 4.0,
    "wage increase second year": 5.5,
    "wage increase third year": 6.0,
    "cost of living adjustment": "tcf",
    "working hours": 37,
    "pension": "none",
    "standby pay": 15,
    "shift differential": 10,
    "education allowance": True,
    "statutory holidays": 12,
    "vacation": "avg",
    "longterm disability assistance": False,
    "contribution to dental plan": "half",
    "bereavement assistance": True,
    "contribution to health plan": "full"
}
```

We call the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
```

**Output:**

```python
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (bad)
print(nodes)       # Output: [1] (The condition `wage increase first year <= 4.5` is true)
```

- As `wage increase first year = 4.0`, which is less than or equal to `4.5`, the function predicts `"bad"` (0), and the condition at the root node is satisfied (`1`).
