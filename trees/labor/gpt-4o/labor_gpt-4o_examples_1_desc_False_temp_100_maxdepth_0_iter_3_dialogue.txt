        nodes[1] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
        if nodes[1]:

### Explanation:
- **Node 1** checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4%. This is a common threshold where negotiations may not be seen as favorable unless other benefits are provided.
- **Node 2** (if wage increase â‰¤ 4) checks if the employer provides full health plan contributions. Full health contributions can compensate for a lower wage increase, leading to a "good" outcome.
- **Node 2** (if wage increase > 4) checks if the vacation allowance is generous ("gnr"). If the wage increase is high and vacation benefits are generous, the outcome is predicted as "good."

This function will return both the prediction (0 for "bad" and 1 for "good") and a list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions at each node were satisfied.
