Based on your given features and the target variable encoding, I'll write a Python function for the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. This function will use "wage increase first year" and "contribution to health plan" as the key features, and it will return both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Decision Tree:
```plaintext
|--- wage increase first year <= 4.5
|    |--- contribution to health plan = none
|    |    |--- class: bad (0)
|    |--- contribution to health plan in {half, full}
|    |    |--- class: good (1)
|--- wage increase first year > 4.5
|    |--- class: good (1)
```

### Python Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "none" if nodes[0] else None
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:
        prediction = 1  # good

    # Return non-None nodes, None nodes should be ignored if they weren't used
    filtered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if node is not None]
    
    return prediction, filtered_nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 3.0,
    'wage increase second year': 4.0,
    'wage increase third year': 5.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'tcf',
    'working hours': 37,
    'pension': 'ret_allw',
    'standby pay': 5,
    'shift differential': 10,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': 'none'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'good' if prediction == 1 else 'bad'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: 
    - `nodes[0]` checks if "wage increase first year" is less than or equal to 4.5.
    - `nodes[1]` checks if "contribution to health plan" is "none", but only if `nodes[0]` is True.
   
2. **Predictions**:
    - If "wage increase first year" is <= 4.5:
        - If "contribution to health plan" is "none": Prediction is "bad" (0).
        - Otherwise: Prediction is "good" (1).
    - If "wage increase first year" is > 4.5: Prediction is "good" (1).

3. This function evaluates the given conditions and returns a prediction along with the evaluations of the conditions in the path taken through the decision tree.

By providing this function, you can input any feature dictionary and it will classify the outcome of the labor negotiations as either "good" or "bad" based on the decision tree, while also returning the intermediate boolean values for the inner nodes used in the decision path.
