Let's create the `predict` function based on the decision tree structure we previously discussed. The function will take a dictionary `X` where keys are feature names and values are their respective values. The function will return the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# features = {
#     'duration': 5,
#     'wage increase first year': 4.0,
#     'wage increase second year': 3.5,
#     'wage increase third year': 3.5,
#     'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
#     'working hours': 37,
#     'pension': 'ret_allw',
#     'standby pay': 10,
#     'shift differential': 5,
#     'education allowance': False,
#     'statutory holidays': 12,
#     'vacation': 'avg',
#     'longterm disability assistance': True,
#     'contribution to dental plan': 'full',
#     'bereavement assistance': True,
#     'contribution to health plan': 'full'
# }

# prediction, node_values = predict(features)
# print("Prediction:", "Good" if prediction == 1 else "Bad")
# print("Node Values:", node_values)
```

**Description:**
1. **Node 0:** Evaluates whether the "wage increase in first year" is less than or equal to 4.5.
2. If **Node 0 is True** (i.e., "wage increase in first year" is 4.5% or less):
   - **Node 1:** Evaluates whether the "duration" of the agreement is less than or equal to 4.5.
     - If **Node 1 is True**: Outcome is classified as "bad" (0).
     - If **Node 1 is False**: Outcome is classified as "good" (1).
3. If **Node 0 is False** (i.e., "wage increase in first year" is greater than 4.5), the outcome is classified as "good" (1) directly.

This function correctly implements the binary decision logic based on the previously discussed decision tree. It also returns a list of booleans indicating the outcomes of the conditions checked at each node.
