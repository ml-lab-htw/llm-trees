Sure, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's your decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 'none'  # Check if the health contribution is 'none'
    nodes[1] = X['duration'] <= 3  # Check if the duration is less than or equal to 3 years
    
    # Determine prediction based on decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Outcome is bad if no health plan contribution
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Outcome is bad if duration is 3 years or less and there is some health plan contribution
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Outcome is good if duration is more than 3 years and there is some health plan contribution

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'duration': 4, 
    'wage increase first year': 3.0, 
    'wage increase second year': 3.5, 
    'wage increase third year': 4.0, 
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none', 
    'working hours': 37, 
    'pension': 'ret_allw', 
    'standby pay': 10, 
    'shift differential': 5, 
    'education allowance': True, 
    'statutory holidays': 10, 
    'vacation': 'avg', 
    'longterm disability assistance': True, 
    'contribution to dental plan': 'full', 
    'bereavement assistance': True, 
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation of the function:
- `X` is a dictionary that contains the features with their respective values.
- `nodes` is a list that will store the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions).
- The function first evaluates whether the 'contribution to health plan' is `none` and stores the result in `nodes[0]`.
- Next, it checks if the `duration` of the agreement is less than or equal to 3 years and stores the result in `nodes[1]`.
- Based on the values of `nodes`, it then determines the `prediction` as follows:
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (health plan contribution is none), the prediction is `0` (bad).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (health plan contribution is partial or full) and `nodes[1]` is `True` (duration ≤ 3), the prediction is `0` (bad).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False` and `nodes[1]` is `False` (duration > 3), the prediction is `1` (good).

### Example Usage:
In the example usage, the tree is evaluated for a set of features, and the function returns:
- `prediction` — whether the outcome of the labor negotiations is good (`1`) or bad (`0`).
- `nodes` — the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions).
  
For the provided example features, the function call `predict(features)` will return:
- `Prediction: 1` (good outcome)
- `Nodes: [False, False]`
