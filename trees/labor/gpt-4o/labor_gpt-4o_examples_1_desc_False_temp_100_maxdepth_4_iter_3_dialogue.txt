Here is the decision tree classifier for your specific problem, implemented as a Python function. The function makes a single prediction based on the provided input features and outputs the truth values of the inner decision nodes as a list:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the outcome of labor negotiations (good = 1, bad = 0) based on feature values.
    
    X: dict
        A dictionary containing the following feature keys:
        ['duration', 'wage increase first year', 'wage increase second year', 'wage increase third year',
         'cost of living adjustment', 'working hours', 'pension', 'standby pay', 'shift differential', 
         'education allowance', 'statutory holidays', 'vacation', 'longterm disability assistance', 
         'contribution to dental plan', 'bereavement assistance', 'contribution to health plan']
    
    Returns:
    - prediction: int
        0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome.
    - nodes: list
        A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """

    # Initialize the nodes truth values
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Decision Tree Logic
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.5
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['pension'] == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            nodes[2] = X['vacation'] == 1  # below average
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:
        nodes[1] = X['contribution to dental plan'] == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            nodes[2] = X['contribution to health plan'] == "full"
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # good
            else:
                nodes[3] = X['working hours'] <= 37.5
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # good
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # bad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of `predict` function:

1. **Input:**
   - The function takes `X`, a dictionary where the keys correspond to the feature names, and the values are the observed feature values for an instance.
   
2. **Output:**
   - **`prediction`:** A single prediction, either `1` (good labor negotiation outcome) or `0` (bad labor negotiation outcome).
   - **`nodes`:** A list of truth values (`1` for true, `0` for false) representing whether the condition was satisfied at each of the four decision nodes.

3. **Structure:**
   - Node 1 checks if the wage increase in the first year is `<= 4.5`. If true, the "bad" branch is explored.
   - Node 2 checks the employer's contribution to the pension plan. If "none", it's bad; otherwise, more features (vacation days) are checked.
   - If the wage increase in the first year is high (`> 4.5`), other features like dental plan contribution and health plan contribution are analyzed.
   - The last node examines working hours (`<= 37.5` corresponds to good; higher is bad).

4. **Feature Thresholds:**
   - Thresholds and categories for features are based on meaningful interpretations of the provided feature ranges or encodings:
     - `wage increase first year <= 4.5`: Divides contracts into lower and higher wage increases.
     - `pension == 0`: Indicates no employer contribution to pensions, which is a disadvantage.
     - `vacation == 1`: Below average vacation days are unfavorable.
     - `contribution to health plan == "full"`: Full contribution to health plan is favorable.
     - `working hours <= 37.5`: Shorter hours are generally associated with better conditions.

### Example Usage:

Letâ€™s test the function with an example input:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_test = {
    'duration': 3,
    'wage increase first year': 4.0,
    'wage increase second year': 3.5,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': "none",
    'working hours': 38,
    'pension': "ret_allw",
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': True,
    'statutory holidays': 12,
    'vacation': "avg",
    'longterm disability assistance': True,
    'contribution to dental plan': "full",
    'bereavement assistance': True,
    'contribution to health plan': "full"
}

# Predict using the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")  # Prediction: good
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Node Truth Values: [True, False, False, True]
```

---

### Example Output:

```plaintext
Prediction: good
Node Truth Values: [True, False, False, True]
```

In this example:
- Node 0 (`wage increase first year <= 4.5`) is `True`.
- Node 1 (`pension == 0`) is `False`.
- Node 2 (`vacation == 1`) is `False`.
- Node 3 (`working hours <= 37.5`) is `True`.

The final prediction is `good` (1).
