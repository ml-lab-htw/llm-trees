Given the format and the feature keys you've provided, I'll create a Python function that constructs a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The function will classify the outcome of labor negotiations as "good" or "bad" based on the most important features: "wage increase first year" and "pension".

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list to track the truth value at each node
    nodes = 2 * [None] 
    
    # Assess the conditions for the nodes in the tree
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] > 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["pension"] == "empl_contr"
    
    # Make the prediction based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Good
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'duration': 5,
    'wage increase first year': 3.5,
    'wage increase second year': 3.0,
    'wage increase third year': 3.0,
    'cost of living adjustment': 'none',
    'working hours': 40,
    'pension': 'none',
    'standby pay': 10,
    'shift differential': 5,
    'education allowance': 'false',
    'statutory holidays': 10,
    'vacation': 'avg',
    'longterm disability assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to dental plan': 'half',
    'bereavement assistance': 'true',
    'contribution to health plan': 'half'
}

# Get prediction and truth values of the inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print("Prediction:", "good" if prediction == 1 else "bad")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Explanation of Function:
1. **Initialization:**
   - A list `nodes` is created to track the truth values of each node condition.

2. **Node Conditions:**
   - `nodes[0]` checks if "wage increase first year" is greater than 4.0.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if "pension" is equal to "empl_contr".

3. **Prediction Logic:**
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, the prediction is `good` (1).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `False`, the function checks `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, the prediction is `good` (1).
     - Otherwise, the prediction is `bad` (0).

### Example Execution:
The example provided shows how to call the `predict` function with a set of feature values (`example_features`). The predict function will return the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Note: In the example usage, change the feature values as necessary to test different scenarios within the decision tree.
