    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First condition: wage increase in the first year of contract
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    
    # Second condition: employer's contribution towards the health plan
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    else:
        # No need to evaluate the second condition if the first one is False
        nodes[1] = None
    
    # Make the decision based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Good outcome (wage increase > 4.5)
    
    # Return the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **`nodes[0]`** checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5%.
- **`nodes[1]`** checks if the employer is offering full health plan coverage, but only if the first condition (`nodes[0]`) is satisfied.
- The tree returns **1 (good)** if either:
  - The wage increase is greater than 4.5%, or
  - The wage increase is less than or equal to 4.5% and the employer provides full health plan coverage.
- Otherwise, the outcome is classified as **0 (bad)**.
