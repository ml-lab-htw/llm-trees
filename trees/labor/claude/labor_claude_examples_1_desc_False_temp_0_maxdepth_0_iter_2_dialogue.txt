Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature specifications, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # First level: wage increase first year check
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second level: duration check
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    
    # Third level: health plan contribution check
    nodes[2] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    # Fourth level: pension check
    nodes[3] = X["pension"] == 0
    
    # Fifth level: working hours check
    nodes[4] = X["working hours"] <= 37.5
    
    # Sixth level: vacation check
    nodes[5] = X["vacation"] == 1  # ba = below average

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.0
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.0
            if nodes[2]:  # health plan = none
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # health plan = half/full
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[3]:  # pension = none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # pension included
            if nodes[4]:  # working hours <= 37.5
                prediction = 1  # good
            else:  # working hours > 37.5
                if nodes[5]:  # vacation = below average
                    prediction = 0  # bad
                else:  # vacation = average/generous
                    prediction = 1  # good
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 6 nodes representing the decision points
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result
4. Uses these conditions to navigate through the decision tree
5. Returns
