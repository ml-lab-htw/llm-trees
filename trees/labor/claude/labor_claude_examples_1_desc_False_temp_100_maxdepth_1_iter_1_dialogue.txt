Based on the labor negotiations features and target variable, I'll create a prediction function with a decision tree of depth 1 using "wage increase first year" as the splitting feature.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (as we have a depth-1 tree)
3. Sets the node value based on whether the wage increase in the first year is <= 4.0
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (bad) if wage increase ≤ 4.0, 1 (good) if wage increase > 4.0
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition (True if wage increase ≤ 4.0, False otherwise)

The threshold of 4.0 was chosen because:
- The feature range is 2.0 to 7.0
- 4.0 represents a moderate wage increase
- Values above 4.0 likely indicate more favorable negotiations
