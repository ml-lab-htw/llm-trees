Based on the provided features and target variable for the labor negotiations dataset, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: checking wage increase in first year
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second node: checking health plan contribution
    # Converting categorical values to numeric for comparison
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] <= 1  # "none" or "half"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # health plan is "none" or "half"
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # health plan is "full"
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    else:  # wage increase > 4.0
        prediction = 1  # good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. First checks if the wage increase in the first year is <= 4.0
4. Then checks if the health plan contribution is less than or equal to "half" (converted to numeric for comparison)
5. Makes a prediction based on these conditions
6. Returns both the prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome) and the list of node truth values

The thresholds were chosen based on reasonable values:
- 4.0 for wage increase (middle of the 2.0-7.0 range)
- Converting categorical health plan contributions to numeric values for comparison
