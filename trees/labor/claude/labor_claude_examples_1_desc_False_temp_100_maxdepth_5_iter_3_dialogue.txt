I'll create a decision tree function based on the labor negotiations features and format it according to your requirements. I'll use the exact feature names and target encoding you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.5
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == 0
    nodes[3] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    nodes[4] = X["vacation"] == 1  # ba = below average

    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.5
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.5
            if nodes[2]:  # pension == none
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # pension == ret_allw or empl_contr
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.5
        if nodes[3]:  # health plan == none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # health plan == half or full
            if nodes[4]:  # vacation == below average
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # vacation == average or generous
                prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree classifier:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes corresponding to the decision points
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result in the nodes list
4. Traverses the tree based on these conditions
5. Returns both the final prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds and conditions used are:
- First-year wage increase: 4.5% (reasonable split point in the 2.0-7.0 range)
- Agreement duration: 2.5 years (short vs
