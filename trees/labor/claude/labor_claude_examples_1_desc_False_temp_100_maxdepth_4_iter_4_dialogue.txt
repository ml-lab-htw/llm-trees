Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts labor negotiation outcomes (0 = bad, 1 = good) and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check wage increase in first year
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second level: Check health plan contribution
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    # Third level: Check duration
    nodes[2] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    
    # Fourth level: Check pension
    nodes[3] = X["pension"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # health plan = none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # health plan = half or full
            if nodes[2]:  # duration <= 2.0
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # duration > 2.0
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[3]:  # pension = none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # pension = ret_allw or empl_contr
            if X["vacation"] == "gnr":
                prediction = 1  # good
            else:
                prediction = 0  # bad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the wage increase in the first year is <= 4.0%
2. Then looks at the health plan contribution
3. Considers the duration of the agreement
4. Evaluates the pension plan
5. Finally considers vacation benefits in some cases

The function returns:
- A prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome)
- A list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the inner nodes was met

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on typical labor negotiation standards:
- 4.0% for wage increase represents a moderate increase
- Duration
