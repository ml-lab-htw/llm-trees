Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that returns both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Main decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X['wage increase first year'] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X['duration'] <= 2.5
    nodes[2] = X['pension'] == 0
    nodes[3] = X['contribution to health plan'] == 0

    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.5
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.5
            if nodes[2]:  # pension == none
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # pension has some contribution
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.5
        if nodes[3]:  # health plan == none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # health plan has contribution
            if X['working hours'] <= 37.5:
                prediction = 1  # good
            else:
                prediction = 0  # bad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the first-year wage increase is <= 4.5%
2. Then considers the duration of the agreement (threshold at 2.5 years)
3. Evaluates the pension plan (presence/absence)
4. Looks at health plan contributions
5. Finally considers working hours (threshold at 37.5 hours)

The function returns:
- A prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome)
- A list of boolean values representing whether each condition was met at the internal nodes

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on typical values in labor negotiations:
- 4.5% is a reasonable threshold for first-year wage increase
- 2.5 years represents a medium-term agreement
- 37.5 hours represents
