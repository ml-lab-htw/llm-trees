Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and target encoding you provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    nodes[2] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. The first node checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5.

3. The second node checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is full.

4. The third node checks if the vacation is generous ("gnr").

5. Based on these conditions, it determines the prediction:
   - If the wage increase is <= 4.5 and the health plan contribution is full, it's good (1).
   - If the wage increase is <= 4.5 and the health plan contribution is not full, it's bad (0).
   - If the wage increase is > 4.5, it's always good (1), regardless of vacation.

6. The function returns both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node truth values.

Note that this tree slightly simplifies the original decision tree by always predicting "good" when the wage increase is > 4.5, regardless of vacation days. This is because the original tree had the same prediction for both branches in this case.
