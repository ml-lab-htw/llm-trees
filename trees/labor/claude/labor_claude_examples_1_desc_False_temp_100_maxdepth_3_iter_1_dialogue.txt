Based on the labor negotiations features and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on the provided feature ranges:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First node: wage increase first year <= 4.0
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second node: duration <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    
    # Third node: health plan coverage = none
    nodes[2] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.0
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # duration > 2.0
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[2]:  # health plan coverage = none
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # health plan coverage = half or full
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list for storing the truth values of the three decision nodes
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean result (True=1, False=0) in the nodes list
4. Uses the decision tree logic to determine the final prediction (0=bad, 1=good)
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values

The thresholds are set based on the provided feature ranges:
- Wage increase first year: threshold at 4.0 (middle of the 2.0-7.0 range)
- Duration: threshold at 2.0 (low end of the 1-7 range)
- Health plan contribution: binary split between "none" and other values ("half"/"full")
