Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the given feature keys and target encoding, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2
    nodes[2] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "none"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. The first node checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.0.

3. The second node checks if the duration of the agreement is less than or equal to 2 years.

4. The third node checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is "none".

5. Based on these conditions, it determines whether the outcome is good (1) or bad (0).

6. Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, using the exact keys for the features as you specified. The thresholds and conditions are set based on the information given in the feature descriptions and what would be reasonable values for labor negotiations.
