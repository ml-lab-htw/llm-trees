Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature names you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for labor negotiations:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    nodes[2] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (for a depth-2 tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The first split is on "wage increase first year". We use 4.5 as the threshold (middle of the 2.0 to 7.0 range).

4. For lower wage increases, we check if the contribution to health plan is "full".

5. For higher wage increases, we check if the vacation is "gnr" (generous).

6. The prediction is 1 (good) if:
   - The wage increase is low but health plan contribution is full
   - The wage increase is high (regardless of vacation)

7. The prediction is 0 (bad) only if:
   - The wage increase is low and health plan contribution is not full

8. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, with slight adjustments to match the exact feature names and to use meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions you provided.
