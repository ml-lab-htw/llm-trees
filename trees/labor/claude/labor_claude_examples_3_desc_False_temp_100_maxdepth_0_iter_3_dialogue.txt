**Explanation and Reasoning for Thresholds:**

* **`wage increase first year <= 4.0`:**  A 4% wage increase is used as a hypothetical threshold. In real-world scenarios, this value would be determined through data analysis and domain expertise, considering factors like inflation and industry standards. A first-year increase below this might be perceived as insufficient.
* **`cost of living adjustment != "none"`:** The presence of *any* cost of living adjustment is considered positive, as it helps maintain workers' real wages.
* **`pension != "none"`:** Similarly, any employer contribution to the pension plan is deemed beneficial.
* **`duration > 3`:** A contract duration of more than 3 years is considered a positive sign, indicating stability and long-term commitment, especially if other conditions are met.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Data-Driven Decisions:**  The chosen thresholds are examples. A real decision tree would need to be trained on a dataset of past negotiations to find the optimal thresholds that best separate "good" and "bad" outcomes.
* **Feature Importance:** The hypothesized importance of these features is based on general labor relations principles. A machine learning algorithm could reveal different feature importance based on actual negotiation data.
* **Complexity:** This simplified tree uses only a few features. A real-world tree might be more complex, including more features and deeper branches to capture more nuanced relationships.  The tree's complexity should be balanced with its ability to generalize to new negotiation scenarios.
* **Encoding Categorical Features:** The code assumes that categorical features like `cost of living adjustment` and `pension` are already appropriately encoded (e.g., as strings).  If they are represented differently in your data, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.  One-hot encoding might be a good approach for these features.



This Python function now provides a more concrete implementation of the decision tree, including specific thresholds and logic, allowing you to test it with example negotiation data. Remember that the accuracy and usefulness of this function depend entirely on the quality and representativeness of the data used to determine its structure and thresholds.
