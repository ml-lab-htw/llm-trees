I'll create a decision tree function based on the labor negotiations features, following the structure from my previous tree but with proper feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: wage increase first year <= 4.0
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second decision node: duration <= 2.5 (only evaluated if first condition is True)
    # OR health plan contribution check (only evaluated if first condition is False)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.5
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    # Making predictions based on the decision path
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.5
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.5
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # contribution to health plan is none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # contribution to health plan is half or full
            prediction = 1  # good
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates the first condition (wage increase in first year <= 4.0)
4. Based on the result of the first condition, evaluates either:
   - duration <= 2.5 (if first condition is True)
   - health plan contribution == 0 (if first condition is False)
5. Makes a prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) based on the path through the tree
6. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (4.0 for wage increase and 2.5 for duration) are chosen as meaningful values within their respective ranges, where:
- wage increase first year ranges from 2.0 to 7
