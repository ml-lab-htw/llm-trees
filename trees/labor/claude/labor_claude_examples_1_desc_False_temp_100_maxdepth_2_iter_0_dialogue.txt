Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, adjusting the thresholds to match the given value ranges:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: wage increase in first year threshold
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5  # threshold within the range [2.0, 7.0]
    
    # Second node: health plan contribution threshold
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0  # checking if there's no contribution
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if wage increase is low
        if nodes[1]:  # if no health plan contribution
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    else:  # if wage increase is high
        prediction = 1  # good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - Whether the first-year wage increase is <= 4.5%
   - Whether there is no contribution to the health plan
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses realistic thresholds based on the provided feature ranges

The function follows the same structure as the decision tree shown earlier but is now properly formatted as a Python function with appropriate feature names and value ranges.
