Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and target variable encoding, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    nodes[2] = X["vacation"] == "gnr"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The first node checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.0.

4. The second node checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is "full".

5. The third node checks if the number of paid vacation days is "gnr" (generous).

6. The decision logic follows the tree structure:
   - If the wage increase is <= 4.0:
     - If the health plan contribution is full, predict good (1)
     - Otherwise, predict bad (0)
   - If the wage increase is > 4.0:
     - Regardless of vacation days, predict good (1)

7. The function returns the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions.

This implementation matches the structure of the decision tree we created earlier, using the correct feature keys and target variable encoding as specified in your instructions.
