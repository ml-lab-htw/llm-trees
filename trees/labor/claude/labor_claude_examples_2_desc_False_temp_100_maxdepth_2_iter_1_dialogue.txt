Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature names and target encoding you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # good

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.0.

4. The second node checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is "full".

5. The prediction logic follows the structure of our decision tree:
   - If the wage increase is <= 4.0 and the health plan contribution is "full", the outcome is good (1).
   - If the wage increase is <= 4.0 and the health plan contribution is not "full", the outcome is bad (0).
   - If the wage increase is > 4.0, the outcome is always good (1).

6. The function returns both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation maintains the structure of the decision tree we created earlier, using the exact feature names you provided and the correct encoding for the target variable (0 for bad, 1 for good). The thresholds and conditions are based on reasonable assumptions about the data, but they might need to be adjusted based on the actual distribution of the data if that information becomes available.
