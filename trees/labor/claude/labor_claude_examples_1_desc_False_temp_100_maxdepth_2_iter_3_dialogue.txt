Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and value ranges, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node checks if wage increase in first year is <= 4.0
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second node checks either duration or pension depending on first split
    if nodes[0]:
        # For lower wage increases, check duration
        nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    else:
        # For higher wage increases, check pension
        nodes[1] = X["pension"] == 0
    
    # Make prediction based on decision path
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.0
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.0
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase > 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # pension is none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # pension is ret_allw or empl_contr
            prediction = 1  # good
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of node conditions
3. Evaluates the conditions at each node
4. Returns both the final prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses realistic thresholds (4.0% for wage increase, 2.0 years for duration)
6. Uses the exact feature names and value encodings provided
