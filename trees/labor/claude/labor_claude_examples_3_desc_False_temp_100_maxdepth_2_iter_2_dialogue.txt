Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.5
    nodes[2] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. It evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - Node 0: Checks if the wage increase in the first year is <= 4.5
   - Node 1: Checks if the duration of the agreement is <= 2.5 years
   - Node 2: Checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is full

3. It then uses these conditions to determine the prediction:
   - If the wage increase is <= 4.5:
     - If the duration is <= 2.5, it predicts 0 (bad outcome)
     - If the duration is > 2.5, it predicts 1 (good outcome)
   - If the wage increase is > 4.5:
     - If the health plan contribution is full, it predicts 1 (good outcome)
     - Otherwise, it predicts 0 (bad outcome)

4. Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the format you requested, returning a single prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The thresholds and conditions are based on the decision tree I provided earlier, using meaningful values that align with the feature descriptions you provided.
