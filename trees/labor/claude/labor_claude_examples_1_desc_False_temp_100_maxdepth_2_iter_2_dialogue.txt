Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and value ranges, I'll create a prediction function for the labor negotiations decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node checks wage increase in first year (threshold 4.0 is reasonable within 2.0-7.0 range)
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second node checks pension for left branch, health plan for right branch
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["pension"] == 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    # Make prediction based on path through tree
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # pension is none
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # pension is ret_allw or empl_contr
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    else:  # wage increase > 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # health plan is none
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # health plan is half or full
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two internal nodes
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on the provided feature ranges
- Returns both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Handles the categorical variables correctly according to their possible values
