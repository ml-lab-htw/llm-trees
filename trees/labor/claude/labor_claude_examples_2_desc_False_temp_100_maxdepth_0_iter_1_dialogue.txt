**Key Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:** Uses the correct feature names from your provided list.
* **Thresholds:**  Includes reasonable threshold values (e.g., 4.0 for first-year wage increase). These are still *hypothetical* and would be learned from data in a real application.
* **Encoding:**  Handles categorical features like "cost of living adjustment" and "vacation" by checking for specific values.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure is more organized and reflects the decision tree logic.
* **Example Usage:** Provides example usage with a dictionary of features.



**To make this a truly effective decision tree, you need to:**

1. **Provide Training Data:**  A dataset with feature values and the corresponding "good/bad" outcome is essential.
2. **Use a Decision Tree Algorithm:** Use a library like scikit-learn (in Python) to train a decision tree on your data.  This will learn the best features, thresholds, and tree structure automatically.  The code I provided is a simplified example, not a full implementation of a decision tree learning algorithm.
