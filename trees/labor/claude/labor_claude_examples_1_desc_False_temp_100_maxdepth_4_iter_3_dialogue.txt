Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts labor negotiation outcomes (0 = bad, 1 = good) and returns the node conditions. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on the given ranges.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check wage increase in first year
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second level: Check duration
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    
    # Third level: Check pension and health plan
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == 0
    
    # Fourth level: Check vacation
    nodes[3] = X["vacation"] == 1  # ba = below average
    
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.0
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.0
            if nodes[2]:  # pension == none
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # pension has some contribution
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if X["contribution to health plan"] == 0:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # health plan has some contribution
            if nodes[3]:  # vacation == below average
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # vacation is average or generous
                prediction = 1  # good
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes to store boolean conditions
3. Evaluates the following key decision points:
   - First-year wage increase (threshold at 4.0)
   - Duration of agreement (threshold at 2 years)
   - Pension plan (none vs. some contribution)
   - Vacation days (below average vs. average/generous)
   - Health plan contribution (none vs. some contribution)
4. Returns both the
