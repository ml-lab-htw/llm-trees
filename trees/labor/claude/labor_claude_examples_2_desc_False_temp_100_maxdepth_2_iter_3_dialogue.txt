Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and target encoding, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.5
    nodes[2] = X["contribution to health plan"] == "full"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:
            prediction = 0  # bad

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as there are 3 decision nodes in our tree) to store the boolean values of each condition.

3. The first condition checks if the wage increase in the first year is less than or equal to 4.5.

4. The second condition checks if the duration of the agreement is less than or equal to 2.5 years.

5. The third condition checks if the employer's contribution to the health plan is "full".

6. The prediction logic follows the structure of our decision tree:
   - If the wage increase is low (<=4.5):
     - If the duration is short (<=2.5), it's classified as bad (0)
     - If the duration is longer, it's classified as good (1)
   - If the wage increase is higher (>4.5):
     - If the health plan contribution is full, it's classified as good (1)
     - Otherwise, it's classified as bad (0)

7. The function returns both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of boolean values for each node condition.

This implementation maintains the structure and logic of the original decision tree while adhering to the specific feature keys and target encoding provided.
