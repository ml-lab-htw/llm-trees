Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and value ranges, I'll create a decision function for the labor negotiations decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node checks wage increase in first year (threshold at 4.0%)
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second node checks duration if wage increase is low,
    # or health plan contribution if wage increase is high
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.5
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    # Make prediction based on the path through the tree
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.5
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # duration > 2.5
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    else:  # wage increase > 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # health plan == none
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # health plan == half or full
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Uses realistic thresholds (4.0% for wage increase, 2.5 years for duration)
- Returns both the prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Follows the tree structure from my previous response
- Handles the categorical variable "contribution to health plan" appropriately

The decision logic is based on common sense in labor negotiations: good outcomes typically require either:
1. Moderate first-year wage increase (>4%) AND good health benefits, OR
2. Lower wage increase but longer contract duration (stability)
