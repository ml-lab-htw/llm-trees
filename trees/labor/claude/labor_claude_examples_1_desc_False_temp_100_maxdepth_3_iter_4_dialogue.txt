Based on the provided features and target variable encoding, here's the decision tree classifier implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First node: wage increase first year <= 4.5
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    
    # Second node: duration <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.5
    
    # Third node: pension check for 'none'
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.5
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.5
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # duration > 2.5
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.5
        if nodes[2]:  # pension is 'none'
            prediction = 0  # bad outcome
        else:  # pension is either 'ret_allw' or 'empl_contr'
            prediction = 1  # good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Evaluates three key conditions:
   - Whether the first-year wage increase is <= 4.5%
   - Whether the agreement duration is <= 2.5 years
   - Whether there is no pension plan
4. Returns both:
   - The final prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome)
   - The list of boolean values for each node condition

The thresholds (4.5 for wage increase and 2.5 for duration) are chosen based on reasonable values within the given ranges, where:
- Wage increase first year ranges from 2.0 to 7.0
- Duration ranges from 1 to 7 years
