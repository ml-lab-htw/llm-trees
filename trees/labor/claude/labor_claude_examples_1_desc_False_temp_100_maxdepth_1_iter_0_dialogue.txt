Based on the labor negotiations features and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function using the wage increase in first year as the splitting criterion:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # good outcome
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the decision (True/False for wage increase first year <= 4.5)
3. Makes a prediction based on the splitting criterion:
   - If wage increase first year <= 4.5, predicts 0 (bad outcome)
   - If wage increase first year > 4.5, predicts 1 (good outcome)
4. Returns both the prediction and the nodes list

The threshold of 4.5 was chosen because:
- The feature range is 2.0 to 7.0
- 4.5 represents a moderate-to-high first-year wage increase
- Values above 4.5 would typically indicate a more favorable negotiation outcome
