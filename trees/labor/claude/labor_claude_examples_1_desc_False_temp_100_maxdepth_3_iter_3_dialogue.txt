Based on the labor negotiations features and target encoding, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome of labor negotiations (0 = bad, 1 = good)
    and returns the prediction along with the truth values of inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    nodes[2] = X["contribution to health plan"] in ["none", "half"]
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.0
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.0
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[2]:  # health plan contribution is none or half
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # health plan contribution is full
            prediction = 1  # good
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates three inner node conditions checking:
   - If first-year wage increase is ≤ 4.0
   - If agreement duration is ≤ 2.0 years
   - If health plan contribution is limited (none or half)
3. Returns:
   - A prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome)
   - A list of three boolean values representing whether each condition was met

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on typical values in labor negotiations:
- 4.0% as a wage increase threshold (moderate increase)
- 2.0 years as a duration threshold (short-term vs. longer-term agreement)
- Health plan contribution categories as defined in the feature description
