Based on the labor negotiations features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that returns both the prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    nodes[2] = X["pension"] == 0
    nodes[3] = X["wage increase second year"] <= 3.0

    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # health plan contribution = none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # health plan contribution = half/full
            if X["duration"] <= 2.0:
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[2]:  # pension = none
            if nodes[3]:  # wage increase second year <= 3.0
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # good
        else:  # pension includes retirement allowance
            if X["vacation"] == "gnr":
                prediction = 1  # good
            else:
                prediction = 0  # bad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses the following key features:
1. First-year wage increase (threshold at 4.0%)
2. Health plan contribution (none vs. half/full)
3. Pension plan (none vs. other options)
4. Duration of agreement (threshold at 2 years)
5. Second-year wage increase (threshold at 3.0%)
6. Vacation benefits (generous vs. others)

The thresholds were chosen based on typical values in labor negotiations:
- 4% for first-year wage increase represents a moderate increase
- 3% for second-year wage increase represents a minimal acceptable increase
- 2 years for duration represents a short-term agreement

The function returns both:
