Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts labor negotiation outcomes (0 = bad, 1 = good) and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check wage increase in first year
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second level: Check duration and working hours
    nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2.0
    nodes[2] = X["working hours"] <= 37.0
    
    # Third level: Check health plan and pension
    nodes[3] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    nodes[4] = X["pension"] == 0
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2.0
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2.0
            if nodes[3]:  # health plan = none
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # health plan = half/full
                prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[2]:  # working hours <= 37.0
            prediction = 1  # good
        else:  # working hours > 37.0
            if nodes[4]:  # pension = none
                prediction = 0  # bad
            else:  # pension included
                prediction = 1  # good
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the wage increase in the first year is <= 4.0
2. For lower wage increases:
   - Checks the duration of agreement
   - Considers health plan contributions
3. For higher wage increases:
   - Evaluates working hours
   - Considers pension benefits

The function returns both the prediction (0 for bad outcome, 1 for good outcome) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node of the tree.

The thresholds and conditions are chosen
