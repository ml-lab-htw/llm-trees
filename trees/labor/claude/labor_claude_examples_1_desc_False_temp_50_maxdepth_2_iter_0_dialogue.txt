Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the same format. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on the given ranges:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: wage increase first year <= 4.0
    nodes[0] = X["wage increase first year"] <= 4.0
    
    # Second decision node: duration <= 2 (for left branch)
    # OR contribution to health plan == 0 (for right branch)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["duration"] <= 2
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["contribution to health plan"] == 0
    
    # Make prediction based on decision path
    if nodes[0]:  # wage increase first year <= 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # duration <= 2
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # duration > 2
            prediction = 1  # good
    else:  # wage increase first year > 4.0
        if nodes[1]:  # contribution to health plan == none
            prediction = 0  # bad
        else:  # contribution to health plan is half or full
            prediction = 1  # good
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
3. First checks if the wage increase in the first year is <= 4.0
4. Based on that result, either:
   - Checks if duration <= 2 (if first wage increase is low)
   - Checks if health plan contribution is 'none' (if first wage increase is high)
5. Returns both the final prediction (0 for bad, 1 for good) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on the provided ranges:
- 4.0 for wage increase (middle of the 2.0-7.0 range)
- 2 for duration (low end of the 1-7 range)
- 'none' as the critical value for health
