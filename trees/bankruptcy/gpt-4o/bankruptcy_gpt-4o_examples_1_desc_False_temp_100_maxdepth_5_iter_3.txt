Here's the decision tree classifier based on the Features and target variable you provided. The maximum depth of the tree is 5, and I've made decisions based on reasonable splits using the provided feature names.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check WC/TA
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.12

    if nodes[0]:  # WC/TA <= 0.12
        # Node 1: Check RE/TA
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.25
        if nodes[1]:  # RE/TA <= -0.25
            # Node 2: Check EBIT/TA
            nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= -0.05
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= -0.05
                # Node 3: Check BVE/BVL
                nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.1
                if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.1
                    # Node 4: Check S/TA
                    nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.7
                    if nodes[4]:  # S/TA <= 0.7
                        prediction = 1  # High likelihood of bankruptcy
                    else:  # S/TA > 0.7
                        prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
                else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.1
                    prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
            else:  # EBIT/TA > -0.05
                prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
        else:  # RE/TA > -0.25
            prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
    else:  # WC/TA > 0.12
        # Node 2: Check EBIT/TA
        nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.08
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA > 0.08
            prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
        else:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.08
            # Node 3: Check S/TA
            nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] > 0.5
            if nodes[3]:  # S/TA > 0.5
                prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
            else:  # S/TA <= 0.5
                # Node 4: Check BVE/BVL
                nodes[4] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.2
                if nodes[4]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.2
                    prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
                else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.2
                    prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The decision tree first checks the ratio of **WC/TA** (Working Capital/Total Assets). If it's less than or equal to 0.12, the company is more likely to go bankrupt.
- **Node 1**: If **WC/TA** is low, we then look at **RE/TA** (Retained Earnings/Total Assets). A very negative RE/TA (≤ -0.25) increases the likelihood of bankruptcy.
- **Node 2**: If **RE/TA** is also very low, we then examine **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets). A low EBIT/TA (≤ -0.05) is a strong indicator of financial distress.
- **Node 3**: If EBIT/TA is low, we consider **BVE/BVL** (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities). If this ratio is very small (≤ 0.1), it suggests the company has weak equity compared to its liabilities.
- **Node 4**: Finally, we check **S/TA** (Sales/Total Assets). If sales are low relative to total assets (≤ 0.7), this is a further sign of distress.

If **WC/TA** is greater than 0.12, the company is considered to be in a better financial state, and other features like **EBIT/TA**, **S/TA**, and **BVE/BVL** are used to further determine the likelihood of bankruptcy.

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.05,
    "RE/TA": -0.3,
    "EBIT/TA": -0.1,
    "S/TA": 0.6,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.05
}
```

### Example Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankruptcy)
print(nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True, True, True]
```
