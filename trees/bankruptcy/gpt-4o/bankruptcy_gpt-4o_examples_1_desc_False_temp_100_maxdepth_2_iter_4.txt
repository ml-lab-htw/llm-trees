Here is the decision tree for the new set of features (WC/TA, RE/TA, EBIT/TA, S/TA, BVE/BVL) and the target variable "company went bankrupt or not" (0 = no, 1 = yes). The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, with 2 inner nodes, and is structured using the most important features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: WC/TA <= 0.1
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
    
    # Second decision node: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If WC/TA <= 0.1 and EBIT/TA <= 0.05, predict bankruptcy
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If WC/TA <= 0.1 and EBIT/TA > 0.05, predict no bankruptcy
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # If WC/TA > 0.1, predict no bankruptcy
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 1 (nodes[0])**: The first decision is based on the ratio of Working Capital to Total Assets (WC/TA). If WC/TA is less than or equal to 0.1, the company is at higher risk of bankruptcy.
  
- **Node 2 (nodes[1])**: If the company passes the first check (WC/TA <= 0.1), we then check the Earnings Before Interest and Tax to Total Assets ratio (EBIT/TA). If EBIT/TA is less than or equal to 0.05, the company is more likely to go bankrupt.

- If both conditions (WC/TA <= 0.1 and EBIT/TA <= 0.05) are true, the prediction is that the company will go bankrupt (1).
  
- If WC/TA is more than 0.1 or if EBIT/TA is more than 0.05, the company is predicted not to go bankrupt (0).
