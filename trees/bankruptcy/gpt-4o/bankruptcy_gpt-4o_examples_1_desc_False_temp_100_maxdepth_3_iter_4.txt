Based on your request and the Features provided, we can create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 and use 3 to 7 inner nodes. Here's a decision tree that uses the most important features for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided features.

Decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets)
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Left branch: WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets)
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Left-left branch: BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities)
            nodes[2] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.5
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
    else:
        # Right branch: RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.2
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Right-left branch: S/TA (Sales/Total Assets)
            nodes[2] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Root Node**:
   - The first decision is based on the feature **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets). If it's **≤ 0.1**, we predict a higher risk of bankruptcy (explore the left side). Otherwise, we move to the right side, indicating a potentially lower risk.

2. **Left Branch** (EBIT/TA ≤ 0.1):
   - The second decision on this branch is based on **WC/TA** (Working Capital/Total Assets). If **WC/TA ≤ 0.05**, we move further left to explore the **BVE/BVL** ratio, which can indicate the level of financial distress based on the company's equity and liabilities.

3. **Right Branch** (EBIT/TA > 0.1):
   - If **RE/TA** (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.2, it might suggest that the company is not retaining enough earnings, which could indicate a higher risk of bankruptcy. In this case, we further examine **S/TA** (Sales/Total Assets) to refine the prediction.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example company data
company_data = {
    "WC/TA": 0.03,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.08,
    "S/TA": 1.2,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Bankruptcy prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This Python function will return a bankruptcy prediction (0 = no, 1 = yes) based on the decision tree rules, and it will also return a list showing the truth values for each inner node that was evaluated (0 or 1 for each condition).
