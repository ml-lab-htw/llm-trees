Here's the Python function implementing the requested decision tree with the exact feature names and encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If WC/TA <= 0.05
        # Node 2: Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.00
        nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.00
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If RE/TA <= 0.00
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # If RE/TA > 0.00
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # If WC/TA > 0.05
        # Node 3: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.03
        nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.03
        
        if nodes[2]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.03
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.03
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **X** is a dictionary that contains the feature values, where the keys are the feature names (e.g., `'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, `'EBIT/TA'`).
- **nodes** is a list that stores the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions). In this tree, there are 3 inner nodes.
- The decision logic follows the structure of the tree:
  - First, it checks if **WC/TA** is less than or equal to 0.05 (Node 1).
  - If **WC/TA** is low (indicating liquidity issues), it then checks **RE/TA** (Node 2) to assess profitability.
  - If **WC/TA** is high, it checks **EBIT/TA** (Node 3) to evaluate the company's profitability relative to total assets.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.04,
    'RE/TA': -0.01,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'S/TA': 1.0,  # Not used in this tree
    'BVE/BVL': 2.0  # Not used in this tree
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print(f'Prediction: {"Bankrupt" if prediction == 1 else "Not Bankrupt"}')
print(f'Inner node truth values: {nodes}')
```

This function will return a prediction of **0** or **1**, where **0** means the company did not go bankrupt and **1** means the company went bankrupt. Additionally, it will return a list of truth values representing whether each internal decision node condition was satisfied (True or False).
