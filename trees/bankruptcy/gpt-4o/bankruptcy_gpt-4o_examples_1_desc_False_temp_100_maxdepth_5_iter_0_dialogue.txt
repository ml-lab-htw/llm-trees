Here is the Python function based on the decision tree we discussed earlier. The function takes a dictionary `X` where keys represent the feature names (mapped exactly as you provided), and values represent the feature values. The function returns a prediction (0 for "no bankruptcy" and 1 for "yes, bankruptcy") and a list of truth values representing whether each inner node's condition was satisfied.

```python
# Decision tree function
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values for each node
    nodes = 7 * [None]

    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.02
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: RE/TA <= -0.01
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.01
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Bankruptcy likely
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Node 2: WC/TA <= 0.04
            nodes[2] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.04
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Bankruptcy likely
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Not bankrupt
                prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 3: BVE/BVL <= 0.50
        nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.50
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: WC/TA <= 0.03
            nodes[4] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.03
            
            if nodes[4]:
                # Bankruptcy likely
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Not bankrupt
                prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 5: S/TA <= 0.80
            nodes[5] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.80
            
            if nodes[5]:
                # Not bankrupt
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # Bankruptcy likely
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: This list holds the truth values of the decisions made at each internal node. Each condition in the decision tree corresponds to a node in this list. If the condition is satisfied, the node holds `1`; otherwise, it holds `0`.
  
- **Prediction**: The decision tree ultimately returns `1` if the company is predicted to go bankrupt and `0` if it is predicted not to go bankrupt.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example of how to use the function
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.05,
    "RE/TA": 0.02,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.03,
    "S/TA": 0.9,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.6
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (not bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, None, None, False, None, False, None]
```

In this example, the decision tree evaluates the conditions step by step, updating the `nodes` list with `True` or `False` values based on whether the conditions are met. The resulting prediction and the nodes' truth values are then returned.
