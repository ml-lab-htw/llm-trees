Based on the example format provided, hereâ€™s a Python function that builds a decision tree classifier to predict if a company went bankrupt or not. This function will return a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Nodes
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.08
    nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.10

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'WC/TA': 0.06,
    'RE/TA': 0.15,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.09,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.05. If true, the company is classified as Bankrupt.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.08. This node is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is false.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.10. This node is evaluated only if `nodes[1]` is true.

2. **Predictions**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is true (`WC/TA` <= 0.05), the company is classified as Bankrupt (1).
   - If `nodes[0]` is false and `nodes[1]` is true (`EBIT/TA` <= 0.08), then the next decision point is `nodes[2]`.
     - If `nodes[2]` is true (`RE/TA` <= 0.10), the company is classified as Bankrupt (1).
     - If `nodes[2]` is false (`RE/TA` > 0.10), the company is classified as Not Bankrupt (0).
   - If `nodes[0]` is false and `nodes[1]` is false (`EBIT/TA` > 0.08), the company is classified as Not Bankrupt (0).

### Example Usage
In the provided `X_example` dictionary, we have:
- `WC/TA`: 0.06
- `RE/TA`: 0.15
- `EBIT/TA`: 0.09
- `S/TA`: 1.2
- `BVE/BVL`: 0.8

When passed to the function, the returned prediction is:
- Prediction: `0` (Not Bankrupt)
- Nodes: `[False, False, None, None]`

In this example, `nodes[0]` is false (so we don't move to Bankrupt immediately), then `nodes[1]` is false, leading us to conclude Not Bankrupt without evaluating further nodes.
