Hereâ€™s how you can structure the decision tree you asked for in a Python function. It follows the structure and logic of the decision tree we discussed earlier, and it adheres to the format you provided. The function will return a prediction (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = bankruptcy) and a list of truth values representing whether the conditions in the nodes were satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize list to store truth values for the decision nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        # Node 2: Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= -0.10
        nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.10
        
        if nodes[1]:  # RE/TA <= -0.10
            # Predict bankruptcy (1) if RE/TA is highly negative
            prediction = 1
        
        else:  # RE/TA > -0.10
            # Node 3: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.03
            nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.03
            
            if nodes[2]:  # WC/TA <= 0.03
                # Predict bankruptcy (1) if working capital is very low
                prediction = 1
            else:  # WC/TA > 0.03
                # Predict no bankruptcy (0) if working capital is adequate
                prediction = 0
    
    else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05
        # Node 4: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL) <= 0.40
        nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 0.40
        
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.40
            # Node 5: Sales/Total Assets (S/TA) <= 1.5
            nodes[4] = X['S/TA'] <= 1.5
            
            if nodes[4]:  # S/TA <= 1.5
                # Predict bankruptcy (1) if sales are low relative to assets
                prediction = 1
            else:  # S/TA > 1.5
                # Predict no bankruptcy (0) if sales are strong
                prediction = 0
        
        else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.40
            # Predict no bankruptcy (0) if equity is high relative to liabilities
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. The function accepts input `X`, which is a dictionary where the keys are the feature names (e.g., `'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, `'EBIT/TA'`, etc.), and the values are the corresponding financial ratios for the company.
   
2. The `nodes` list stores whether the conditions at each decision node are satisfied (`True` or `False`). This list will have 5 elements, corresponding to the 5 decision nodes in the tree.

3. The decision tree logic follows the structure we discussed earlier:
   - The first decision is based on whether `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05.
   - If true, it further checks `RE/TA` and `WC/TA`.
   - If false, it moves to check `BVE/BVL` and `S/TA`.

4. The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = bankruptcy).
   - `nodes`: A list of booleans indicating whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input: a company with specific financial ratios
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.02,    # Working Capital/Total Assets
    'RE/TA': -0.15,   # Retained Earnings/Total Assets
    'EBIT/TA': 0.04,  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
    'S/TA': 1.2,      # Sales/Total Assets
    'BVE/BVL': 0.35   # Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
}

# Get prediction and node decisions
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (1 = bankrupt, 0 = not bankrupt):", prediction)
print("Node decisions:", nodes)
```

### Example output:

```python
Prediction (1 = bankrupt, 0 = not bankrupt): 1
Node decisions: [True, True, None, None, None]
```

This output indicates that the company is predicted to go bankrupt (`1` for bankruptcy), and the truth values for the decision nodes are `[True, True, None, None, None]`, meaning the first two conditions were satisfied, and the remaining conditions were not evaluated since the prediction was made in an earlier branch.
