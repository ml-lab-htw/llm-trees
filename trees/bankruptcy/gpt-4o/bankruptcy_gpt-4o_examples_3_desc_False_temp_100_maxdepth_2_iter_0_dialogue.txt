Given the decision tree and feature details, we can construct the required Python function for the dataset. The tree takes into account two features: WC/TA and EBIT/TA and checks specific thresholds to classify whether a company went bankrupt or not. Below is the implementation of the decision tree in a Python function.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initializing the list to store the truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 0: WC/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the first condition is satisfied (WC/TA <= 0.05)
        prediction = 1  # bankrupt
    else:  # If the first condition is not satisfied (WC/TA > 0.05)
        # Inner node 1: EBIT/TA <= 0.04
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.04
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the second condition is satisfied (EBIT/TA <= 0.04)
            prediction = 1  # bankrupt
        else:  # If the second condition is not satisfied (EBIT/TA > 0.04)
            prediction = 0  # not bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.03,
    'RE/TA': -0.1,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.02,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if "WC/TA" is less than or equal to 0.05.
2. **Node 1**: If "WC/TA" is greater than 0.05, it then checks if "EBIT/TA" is less than or equal to 0.04.

- If "WC/TA" is ≤ 0.05, the company is classified as bankrupt (1).
- If "WC/TA" is > 0.05, the decision depends on "EBIT/TA":
  - If "EBIT/TA" ≤ 0.04, the company is bankrupt (1).
  - Otherwise, the company is not bankrupt (0).

The function returns the prediction along with a list of boolean values representing the satisfaction of each condition in the decision tree.
