def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the inner node condition
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05  # Threshold chosen based on profitability
    
    # Root node decision
    if nodes[0]:
        # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05, predict the company went bankrupt
        prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
    else:
        # If EBIT/TA > 0.05, predict the company did not go bankrupt
        prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree has a depth of 1, with a single split based on the key feature **EBIT/TA**.
- The threshold chosen is **0.05**, which is a reasonable cutoff for predicting financial health. Companies with an EBIT/TA ratio less than or equal to 0.05 are predicted to have gone bankrupt (1), while companies with EBIT/TA higher than 0.05 are predicted to have not gone bankrupt (0).
- The `nodes` list stores the truth value of the inner node condition (`nodes[0]`), where `1` means the condition is satisfied (i.e., EBIT/TA â‰¤ 0.05) and `0` means the condition is not satisfied (i.e., EBIT/TA > 0.05).
