Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree for the bankruptcy prediction problem as described:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company went bankrupt or not based on financial ratios.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if the company did not go bankrupt, 1 if it did.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05
    # Node 1: Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.10
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.10

    if nodes[0]:
        # If WC/TA <= 0.05, predict Bankrupt (1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If WC/TA > 0.05 and RE/TA <= 0.10, predict Bankrupt (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If WC/TA > 0.05 and RE/TA > 0.10, predict Not Bankrupt (0)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.04,  # Working Capital/Total Assets
    'RE/TA': 0.08,  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets
    'EBIT/TA': 0.12,  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
    'S/TA': 0.9,  # Sales/Total Assets
    'BVE/BVL': 0.5  # Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.05.
   - If `True`, the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (1).
2. If **Node 0** is `False`, **Node 1** checks if `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.10.
   - If `True`, the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (1).
   - If `False`, the company is classified as **Not Bankrupt** (0).

This function uses a structure similar to the example provided, with a depth of 2 and meaningful thresholds for the features.
