```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First condition based on "EBIT/TA"
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.025
    
    # Second condition based on "RE/TA"
    if not nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA > 0.025
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.04
    
    # Decision process
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.025
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.025
        if nodes[1]:  # RE/TA <= 0.04
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # RE/TA > 0.04
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'WC/TA': -0.02,
    'RE/TA': 0.03,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.02,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node Conditions:", nodes)
```

This function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` of feature values, evaluates the conditions based on "EBIT/TA" and "RE/TA", determines the classification (either bankrupt or not bankrupt), and returns the prediction along with a list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions at each node were satisfied. 

In the example usage, the function processes the input features, makes a prediction, and prints out the results. Adjust the feature values in `X` to test different scenarios.
