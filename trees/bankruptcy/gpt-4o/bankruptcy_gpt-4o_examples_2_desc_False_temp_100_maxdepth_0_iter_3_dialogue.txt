Below is the Python function to predict whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided financial features, formatted similarly to the examples given:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    # Creating nodes based on the decision tree structure discussed
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.04
    nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.01
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.5
    nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0

    # Decision tree based classification
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05**: Check if the Working Capital/Total Assets ratio is ≤ 0.05.
2. **nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.04**: Check if the Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets ratio is ≤ 0.04.
3. **nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.01**: Check if the Retained Earnings/Total Assets ratio is ≤ 0.01.
4. **nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.5**: Check if the Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities ratio is ≤ 0.5.
5. **nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0**: Check if the Sales/Total Assets ratio is ≤ 1.0.

Each node represents a decision condition, and the combination of these conditions determines the prediction outcome (0 for Not Bankrupt, 1 for Bankrupt).

### Usage Example:

```python
# Example input feature values
features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.04,
    'RE/TA': 0.02,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.6
}

# Predicting bankruptcy
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")
```

When you run the above code with the provided example input, it will output whether the company is predicted to be bankrupt or not, along with the truth values for each decision node in the tree.
