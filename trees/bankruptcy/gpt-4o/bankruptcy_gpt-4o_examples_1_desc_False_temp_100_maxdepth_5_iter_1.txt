Here is the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes based on the given features
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.03
    nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.2
    nodes[4] = X["BVE/BVL"] > 0.5

    # Decision tree logic based on inner nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **WC/TA** (Working Capital/Total Assets) is used as the root node (nodes[0]). If a company's working capital to total assets ratio is less than or equal to 0.05, this could indicate financial difficulties, so we consider this a high-risk factor for bankruptcy.
  
- **RE/TA** (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) comes next (nodes[1]). Low retained earnings relative to total assets (<= 0.1) can indicate poor historical profitability, a potential sign of financial distress.

- **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) is considered in nodes[2]. A higher EBIT/TA (> 0.03) suggests that the company is more profitable, which reduces the likelihood of bankruptcy.

- **S/TA** (Sales/Total Assets) is used in nodes[3]. Low sales as a proportion of total assets (<= 0.2) indicate that the company may not be generating enough revenue relative to its size, increasing the risk of bankruptcy.

- **BVE/BVL** (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities) is used in nodes[4]. A higher ratio (> 0.5) suggests that the company has more equity relative to its liabilities, which typically indicates financial stability.

### Output:

The function will return:
1. A **prediction**: 0 for no bankruptcy and 1 for bankruptcy.
2. A list of **truth values (nodes)**: This is a list of boolean evaluations for each decision node in the tree (1 for True, 0 for False).
