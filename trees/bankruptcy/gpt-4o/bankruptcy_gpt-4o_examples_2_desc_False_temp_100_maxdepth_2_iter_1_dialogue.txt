Given the description, let's define a Python function for our decision tree classifier, which predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not and returns the nodes' truth values.

We'll utilize the two most important features identified earlier:
1. `EBIT/TA`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
2. `RE/TA`: Retained Earnings/Total Assets

And we assume the thresholds for these splits as follows:
- If `EBIT/TA <= 0.10` then the company is more likely to be bankrupted.
- If `EBIT/TA > 0.10` then we further check `RE/TA <= 0.20`.

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the first node
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10

    if nodes[0]:
        # If the first condition is satisfied, the company is classified as bankrupt
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Evaluate the second node if the first condition is not satisfied
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.20
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the second condition is satisfied, the company is classified as bankrupt
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If both conditions fail, the company is classified as not bankrupt
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "WC/TA": -0.05,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.08,
    "S/TA": 1.5,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. The function starts by initializing a list `nodes` with two `None` elements to keep track of whether the conditions in the decision tree are satisfied.
2. The first condition checks `EBIT/TA` against `<= 0.10`.
   - If this condition is `True`, the function immediately predicts `Bankrupt (1)`.
   - Otherwise, the function proceeds to evaluate the second condition.
3. The second condition checks `RE/TA` against `<= 0.20`.
   - If this condition is `True`, the function predicts `Bankrupt (1)`.
   - If both conditions are `False`, the function predicts `Not Bankrupt (0)`.

In `X_example`, replace the feature values with actual data to test different scenarios. The results show the classification and the truth values of the decision tree's internal nodes.
