Here's how the decision tree can be implemented as a Python function based on the features you provided. The function returns a prediction (`0` for "company did not go bankrupt" and `1` for "company went bankrupt") as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.02
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.02
        # Node 1: WC/TA <= -0.15
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.15
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If WC/TA <= -0.15
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # If WC/TA > -0.15
            # Node 2: RE/TA <= -0.10
            nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.10
            
            if nodes[2]:  # If RE/TA <= -0.10
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # If RE/TA > -0.10
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.02
        # Node 3: S/TA <= 1.00
        nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.00
        
        if nodes[3]:  # If S/TA <= 1.00
            # Node 4: BVE/BVL <= 0.85
            nodes[4] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.85
            
            if nodes[4]:  # If BVE/BVL <= 0.85
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # If BVE/BVL > 0.85
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:  # If S/TA > 1.00
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature-based conditions**:
   - The first node checks if the company's **EBIT/TA** is less than or equal to 0.02, which is a key profitability metric.
   - If **EBIT/TA** is low (less than or equal to 0.02), the next check is on **WC/TA**, which tests if the company's working capital is severely negative (≤ -0.15).
   - If **WC/TA** is not severely negative, the decision is refined by checking **RE/TA**, which indicates whether the company has accumulated significant losses (≤ -0.10).

2. **If the company's EBIT/TA is greater than 0.02** (indicating better profitability), the decision moves to checking **S/TA** (Sales/Total Assets).
   - If the company's **S/TA** is low (≤ 1.00), indicating weak revenue generation relative to assets, it further checks **BVE/BVL** to assess leverage.
   - A high leverage ratio (**BVE/BVL** ≤ 0.85) could signal financial distress.

3. **Return values**:
   - The function returns two values:
     - A **prediction** (either `0` for "not bankrupt" or `1` for "bankrupt").
     - A list of **truth values** for each inner node, indicating which conditions were met (`1` for satisfied, `0` for not satisfied).

### Example usage:
```python
# Input dictionary with financial ratios
X = {
    "WC/TA": -0.12,
    "RE/TA": -0.05,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.03,
    "S/TA": 0.9,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.80
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt) or 0 (Not Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # List of truth values for the inner nodes
```

This function provides a clear, interpretable decision-making process based on the financial ratios you provided, and it also outputs the intermediate truth values for each decision node in the tree.
