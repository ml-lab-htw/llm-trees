Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided features. The function includes the predictions and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not based on financial features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Input features as a dictionary with the following keys:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): 0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt
        - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First split: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05

    # Second split: RE/TA <= 0.10
    if nodes[0]:
        # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05, classify as bankrupt
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # If EBIT/TA > 0.05, check RE/TA <= 0.10
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.10
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Let's test the function with an example input:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.1,
    "RE/TA": 0.08,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.06,
    "S/TA": 1.5,
    "BVE/BVL": 2.0
}

# Call the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Explanation of Example:
1. **EBIT/TA = 0.06**: The first split checks if `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`. Since `0.06 > 0.05`, `nodes[0] = False`.
2. **RE/TA = 0.08**: The second split checks if `RE/TA <= 0.10`. Since `0.08 <= 0.10`, `nodes[1] = True`.
3. Based on the decision tree logic, the company is classified as **bankrupt** (prediction = 1).

This function uses a maximum depth of 2 and the most important features (`EBIT/TA` and `RE/TA`) to make the prediction. It also returns the truth values of the inner nodes for interpretability.
