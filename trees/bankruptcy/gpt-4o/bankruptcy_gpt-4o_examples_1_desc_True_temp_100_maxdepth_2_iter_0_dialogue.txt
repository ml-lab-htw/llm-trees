Here's how you can create the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.05,
    'RE/TA': 0.07,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.045,
    'S/TA': 2.5,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes Initialization:** The `nodes` list holds the truth values of the inner nodes. Initially, it contains `None` values and is later populated with boolean values based on the conditions.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the "Retained Earnings/Total Assets" (RE/TA) is less than or equal to 0.1.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the "Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets" (EBIT/TA) is less than or equal to 0.05.

3. **Decision Tree Structure:** 
   - If `nodes[0]` is true (RE/TA <= 0.1), we classify the company as bankrupt (prediction = 1).
   - Otherwise, we check `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is true (EBIT/TA <= 0.05), we classify the company as bankrupt (prediction = 1).
     - If `nodes[1]` is false, the company is not bankrupt (prediction = 0).

4. **Return Values:** The function returns the final `prediction` and the `nodes` list containing the truth values of the inner nodes.

This function provides a straightforward way to classify companies based on the two most important financial ratios and also offers insight into the decision path taken for each prediction.
