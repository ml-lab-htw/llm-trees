Sure! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not, based on the provided features and thresholds. The function returns the prediction as well as the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes (0 or 1)
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.02
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
        # Node 1: WC/TA <= -0.1
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.1
        
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= -0.1
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > -0.1
            # Node 2: RE/TA <= -0.2
            nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.2
            
            if nodes[2]:  # RE/TA <= -0.2
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # RE/TA > -0.2
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
        # Node 3: BVE/BVL <= 0.5
        nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.5
        
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.5
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.5
            # Node 4: S/TA <= 1.2
            nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.2
            
            if nodes[4]:  # S/TA <= 1.2
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
            else:  # S/TA > 1.2
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    
    # Return both the prediction and the list of truth values for the nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

- **Input (`X`)**: A dictionary where the keys represent the feature names (e.g., `'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, etc.) and the values represent the corresponding values for a particular company.
  
- **`nodes` list**: A list of boolean values representing whether the condition at each inner node was satisfied (`True` = 1) or not (`False` = 0). The list has 5 entries because the tree has 5 inner nodes.

- **Decision Logic**: The logic follows the decision tree structure:
  1. First, it checks if `EBIT/TA <= 0.02` (node 0).
  2. Depending on the result of node 0, subsequent conditions are evaluated.
  3. The tree navigates through additional conditions (e.g., `WC/TA <= -0.1`, `RE/TA <= -0.2`, etc.) to make the final prediction.

- **Output**: The function returns two things:
  1. The **prediction** (`0` for "Not Bankrupt", `1` for "Bankrupt").
  2. A list of the truth values (`nodes`), which indicates whether each condition in the inner nodes was satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example company data
company_data = {
    'WC/TA': -0.05,
    'RE/TA': -0.1,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.03,
    'S/TA': 1.1,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.6
}

# Make a prediction using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Not Bankrupt)
print(f"Node decisions: {nodes}")   # Output: Node decisions: [False, None, None, False, True]
```

In this example, the company has a positive EBIT/TA ratio (`0.03`), so the model evaluates other features like the company's leverage (BVE/BVL) and asset efficiency (S/TA) to determine that the company is **not bankrupt** (`0`). The `nodes` list shows which paths were taken during the decision-making process.
