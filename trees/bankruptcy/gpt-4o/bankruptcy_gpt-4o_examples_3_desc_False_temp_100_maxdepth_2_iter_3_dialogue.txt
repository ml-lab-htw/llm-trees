Certainly! Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier using the specified feature keys and a maximum depth of 2. The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Decision Tree Classifier Function
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.3
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1 if not nodes[0] else None
    
    # Decision tree logic based on the nodes' truth values
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1   # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

# Testing the function with an example input
example_input = {
    "WC/TA": 0.2,
    "RE/TA": 0.05,
    "EBIT/TA": -0.2,
    "S/TA": 1.1,
    "BVE/BVL": 2.0
}

print(predict(example_input))  # Output will be (1, [True, None])
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: A list `nodes` is created to store the truth values of the internal nodes.
2. **Node Conditions**:
   - The first node checks if `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.3.
   - The second node checks if `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.1, **only** if the first node condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] is False`).
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If the first node condition `nodes[0]` is true, then the company is predicted to go Bankrupt (`prediction = 1`).
   - If the first node condition is false, we look at the second node condition to further classify:
     - If the second node condition `nodes[1]` is true, the company is predicted to go Bankrupt (`prediction = 1`).
     - If the second node condition is false, the company is predicted to be Non-Bankrupt (`prediction = 0`).

### Example Call:
The provided example with `example_input` results in the prediction of `1` (Bankrupt) with the internal node truth values being `[True, None]`. This indicates that the decision was made at the first node itself.
