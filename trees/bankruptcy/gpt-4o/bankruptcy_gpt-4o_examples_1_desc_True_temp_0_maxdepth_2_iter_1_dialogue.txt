Sure, I can translate the decision tree into a Python function that satisfies your requirements. Here is the decision tree function for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not, based on the given features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # First split on WC/TA
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.2
    # Second split on EBIT/TA if first condition is satisfied
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1 if nodes[0] else X["RE/TA"] <= 0.15
    
    # Decision logic based on decision tree structure described
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
features = {
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "RE/TA": 0.1,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.05,
    "S/TA": 0.3,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

In this function, `X` is a dictionary where keys correspond to feature names and values correspond to feature values. The function returns:
- `prediction`, which is `0` for "not bankrupt" or `1` for "bankrupt".
- `nodes`, a list of binary truth values for the conditions at the inner nodes of the decision tree.

The function follows the specified example of decision tree logic using the importance of features `WC/TA`, `EBIT/TA`, and `RE/TA`. You can call this function with a dictionary of features and it will provide the classification along with the evaluation of the decision nodes.
