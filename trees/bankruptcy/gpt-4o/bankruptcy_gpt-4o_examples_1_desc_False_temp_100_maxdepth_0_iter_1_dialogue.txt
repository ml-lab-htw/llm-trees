### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (as specified), and the values are the corresponding feature values for a company.
   
2. **Inner Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: This checks if **EBIT/TA** is less than or equal to 0.05. If true, the company is likely struggling with profitability.
   - `nodes[1]`: If profitability is low (i.e., `nodes[0]` is true), the next check is on **WC/TA** (liquidity) to see if it's less than or equal to 0.10. If both conditions are true, the company is likely bankrupt.
   - If the profitability is good (i.e., `nodes[0]` is false), the next check is on retained earnings (**RE/TA**) to further assess financial stability.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If both **EBIT/TA** and **WC/TA** are below their respective thresholds, the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`1`).
   - If profitability is good but retained earnings are low, the company is also classified as **Bankrupt** (`1`).
   - Otherwise, the company is classified as **Not Bankrupt** (`0`).

4. **Output**: The function returns two values:
   - The **prediction** (`0` or `1`), indicating whether the company is bankrupt or not.
   - A **list of boolean values** (`nodes`), representing whether each inner node condition was satisfied (`True` or `False`).
