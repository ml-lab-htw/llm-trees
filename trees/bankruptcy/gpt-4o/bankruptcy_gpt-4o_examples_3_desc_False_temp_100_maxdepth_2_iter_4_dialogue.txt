### Decision Tree Function for Predicting Company Bankruptcy

Given the features and their importance, as well as the target variable encoding, the decision tree logic is now encapsulated within a Python function. This function returns a prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Here are the exact features you provided:
- 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
- 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
- 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
- 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

Target variable:
- company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### Example of Decision Tree Prediction Function

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.2
    
    # Determine prediction based on the decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Test example
X_test = {'WC/TA': 0.05, 'RE/TA': 0.2, 'EBIT/TA': 0.15, 'S/TA': 0.5, 'BVE/BVL': 1.0}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input.
- The `nodes` list is initialized to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
- The first condition checks if `'WC/TA'` is less than or equal to 0.1.
- The second condition checks if `'EBIT/TA'` is less than or equal to 0.2.
- Based on the truth values stored in `nodes`, the function determines whether the company went bankrupt (1) or not (0).

### Example Run:
For the test example `X_test = {'WC/TA': 0.05, 'RE/TA': 0.2, 'EBIT/TA': 0.15, 'S/TA': 0.5, 'BVE/BVL': 1.0}`, the function will return:
- `Prediction: 1` indicating the company went bankrupt.
- `Nodes: [True, False]` indicating the truth values of the inner nodes.

This function adheres to the maximum depth of 2 as requested and uses meaningful threshold values derived from the provided decision tree.
