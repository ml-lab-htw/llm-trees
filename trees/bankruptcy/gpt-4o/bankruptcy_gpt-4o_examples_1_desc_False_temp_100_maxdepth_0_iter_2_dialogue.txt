The decision tree will use the financial ratios to predict whether a company went bankrupt (1) or not (0). I will ensure that the feature names and thresholds are meaningful as per your specifications.

### Python Function for Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.025
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.025
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second split: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.01
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.01
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If RE/TA <= 0.025 and EBIT/TA <= 0.01, predict bankrupt (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If RE/TA <= 0.025 and EBIT/TA > 0.01, predict not bankrupt (0)
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # Second split: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If RE/TA > 0.025 and WC/TA <= 0.05, predict bankrupt (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If RE/TA > 0.025 and WC/TA > 0.05, predict not bankrupt (0)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **First Split (Node 0)**: The decision tree checks if the **Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA)** is less than or equal to `0.025`. If this condition is true, the company is more likely to be in financial distress.
   
2. **Second Split (Node 1), if Node 0 is True**: If the company has low **RE/TA**, the tree further checks if **Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)** is less than or equal to `0.01`. If both conditions are satisfied, the company is predicted to be bankrupt (1). Otherwise, it is predicted to be not bankrupt (0).

3. **Second Split (Node 1), if Node 0 is False**: If the **RE/TA** is greater than `0.025`, the decision tree checks **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)**. A low **WC/TA** (â‰¤ `0.05`) suggests liquidity issues, and the company is predicted to be bankrupt (1). Otherwise, it is predicted to be not bankrupt (0).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example of a company's financial ratios
example_company = {
    "WC/TA": 0.04,
    "RE/TA": 0.03,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.02,
    "S/TA": 0.5,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2
}

# Predict bankruptcy
prediction, nodes = predict(example_company)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this case, for the given input, the function will return the bankruptcy prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values corresponding to whether each node's condition was satisfied.
