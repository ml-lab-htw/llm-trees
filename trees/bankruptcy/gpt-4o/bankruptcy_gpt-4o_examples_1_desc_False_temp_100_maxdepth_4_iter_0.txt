Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function using the Features you provided with a maximum depth of 4. The decision tree will return both the prediction (whether the company went bankrupt or not) and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Decision tree nodes
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1  # Node 1: Is working capital to total assets ratio low?
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.2  # Node 2: Is retained earnings to total assets ratio low?
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05  # Node 3: Is earnings before interest and tax to total assets ratio low?
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 1.5  # Node 4: Is book value of equity to liabilities ratio low?

    # Decision logic based on the truth values of the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High chance of bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Moderately high chance of bankruptcy
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High chance of bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Moderate chance of no bankruptcy
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Moderate chance of bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low chance of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Very low chance of bankruptcy
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Moderate chance of bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low chance of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Very low chance of bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Very low chance of bankruptcy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 1 (WC/TA ≤ 0.1):** If the company's working capital to total assets ratio is low, it's an indicator of financial distress.
- **Node 2 (RE/TA ≤ 0.2):** Low retained earnings relative to total assets could suggest instability and higher risk.
- **Node 3 (EBIT/TA ≤ 0.05):** Earnings before interest and tax being low relative to total assets is another red flag.
- **Node 4 (BVE/BVL ≤ 1.5):** If the book value of equity relative to liabilities is low, the company may have higher financial leverage and risk.

The decision tree uses these features to determine the likelihood of bankruptcy, returning both the prediction and the truth values of each inner node.
