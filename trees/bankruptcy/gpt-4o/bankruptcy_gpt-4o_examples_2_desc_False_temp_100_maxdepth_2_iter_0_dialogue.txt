Here's the Python function for the depth-2 decision tree based on the financial features, following the structure of the given examples. The decision tree aims to predict whether a company went bankrupt (1 = yes) or not (0 = no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Create a list to store the truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: EBIT/TA <= 0.03
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.03
        # Second decision node: BVE/BVL <= 0.60
        nodes[1] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.60
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If BVE/BVL <= 0.60
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # If BVE/BVL > 0.60
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
    
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.03
        # Second decision node: WC/TA <= 0.15
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.15
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If WC/TA <= 0.15
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # If WC/TA > 0.15
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes list**: Contains the truth values of the decision nodes in the order they appear along the tree.  
   - `nodes[0]`: Tracks whether `EBIT/TA` is below or above `0.03`.  
   - `nodes[1]`: Tracks further decisions based on the results at the first level (`BVE/BVL` if `EBIT/TA <= 0.03`, or `WC/TA` if `EBIT/TA > 0.03`).  

2. **EBIT/TA (Threshold: 0.03)**: First level of the tree uses this profitability ratio as the primary decision factor. Threshold of `0.03` is chosen as a meaningful cutoff because very low profitability (below 3%) may indicate financial distress.

3. **BVE/BVL (Threshold: 0.60)**: At the second level, we evaluate a solvency measure to decide whether companies with poor profitability are likely bankrupt.

4. **WC/TA (Threshold: 0.15)**: For companies with good profitability, liquidity becomes an important factor. Companies with very low working capital relative to their total assets are at risk.

### Example Predictions:
#### Example 1:
```python
X = {"WC/TA": 0.20, "RE/TA": 0.10, "EBIT/TA": 0.02, "S/TA": 0.50, "BVE/BVL": 0.50}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True]
```

Explanation:
- `EBIT/TA = 0.02 <= 0.03`: True (Bankruptcy prediction continues down the left branch.)
- `BVE/BVL = 0.50 <= 0.60`: True (Company is classified as bankrupt.)

---

#### Example 2:
```python
X = {"WC/TA": 0.25, "RE/TA": 0.15, "EBIT/TA": 0.05, "S/TA": 0.60, "BVE/BVL": 0.80}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Not Bankrupt)
print(nodes)       # Output: [False, False]
```

Explanation:
- `EBIT/TA = 0.05 <= 0.03`: False (Profit margins indicate good financial health, bankruptcy evaluation switches to right branch.)
- `WC/TA = 0.25 <= 0.15`: False (Good liquidity suggests the company is solvent.)

This structure adheres to the requirements, using thresholds selected based on meaningful ratios and limits a maximum tree depth of 2 for binary classification between "bankrupt" (1) and "not bankrupt" (0).
