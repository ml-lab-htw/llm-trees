Based on the description provided and using the sample decision tree from the previous step, here is the `predict` function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.2
    nodes[1] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 0.5 if nodes[0] else None
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.1 if not nodes[0] else None
    nodes[3] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.8 if nodes[2] is False else None
    nodes[4] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.2 if nodes[3] else None
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.2
        if nodes[1]:  # Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities <= 0.5
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt
    else:  # Working Capital/Total Assets > 0.2
        if nodes[2]:  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets <= 0.1
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets > 0.1
            if nodes[3]:  # Sales/Total Assets <= 0.8
                if nodes[4]:  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.2
                    prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes 

# Test with example features
features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.1,
    'RE/TA': 0.3,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.15,
    'S/TA': 0.7,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.4
}

print(predict(features))
```

### Explanation:
- `nodes[0]` evaluates if `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.2.
- If `nodes[0]` is true, `nodes[1]` evaluates if `BVE/BVL` is less than or equal to 0.5.
- If `nodes[0]` is false, `nodes[2]` evaluates if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.1.
- If `nodes[2]` is false, `nodes[3]` evaluates if `S/TA` is less than or equal to 0.8.
- If `nodes[3]` is true, `nodes[4]` evaluates if `RE/TA` is less than or equal to 0.2.

The prediction is then made based on the values of these nodes. This structure should be updated with real data validations for accuracy.
