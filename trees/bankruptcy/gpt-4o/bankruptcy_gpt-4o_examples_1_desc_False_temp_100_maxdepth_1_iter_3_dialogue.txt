Here's the decision tree as a Python function, based on the features you provided. Given the importance of liquidity in predicting bankruptcy, I've used **WC/TA** (Working Capital/Total Assets) as the primary decision node, with a threshold of 0.05 as mentioned earlier. The function will return the binary prediction (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = bankruptcy) and the truth values of the internal nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # We only have one node since the max depth is 1
    
    # Node 0: WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets) <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt (yes)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt (no)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Input:** `X` is a dictionary where each key is one of the feature names (e.g., 'WC/TA').
- **Node 0:** The condition checks whether the company's **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)** is less than or equal to 0.05.
  - If the condition is **True**, the company is predicted to have gone **bankrupt** (prediction = 1).
  - If the condition is **False**, the company is predicted to have **not gone bankrupt** (prediction = 0).
- **Return:** The function returns:
  1. `prediction` (0 for no bankruptcy, 1 for bankruptcy),
  2. `nodes`, a list of boolean values representing whether the condition at each node was satisfied or not (in this case, just one node).

### Example usage:
```python
X = {'WC/TA': 0.04, 'RE/TA': 0.1, 'EBIT/TA': 0.05, 'S/TA': 0.9, 'BVE/BVL': 2.0}
predict(X)
# Output: (1, [True])  -> Company went bankrupt, WC/TA condition was satisfied

X = {'WC/TA': 0.10, 'RE/TA': 0.2, 'EBIT/TA': 0.08, 'S/TA': 1.2, 'BVE/BVL': 2.5}
predict(X)
# Output: (0, [False]) -> Company did not go bankrupt, WC/TA condition was not satisfied
```

This function implements a decision tree with a depth of 1, using **WC/TA** as the key feature for predicting bankruptcy.
