Here is a decision tree classifier based on the Features and the target variable "company went bankrupt or not":

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes based on provided features
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.2
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] > 0.7

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0:** Checks if the ratio of retained earnings to total assets (`RE/TA`) is less than or equal to 0.2. Lower retained earnings could indicate poor financial health, so this is an important condition.
- **Node 1:** Checks if working capital to total assets (`WC/TA`) is less than or equal to 0.1. A low working capital ratio implies liquidity issues.
- **Node 2:** Checks if earnings before interest and tax to total assets (`EBIT/TA`) is less than or equal to 0.05. Low or negative earnings are indicative of financial stress.
- **Node 3:** Checks if sales to total assets (`S/TA`) is greater than 0.7. Higher sales relative to assets may imply strong performance, which could reduce the risk of bankruptcy.

This specific decision tree is designed to make a prediction (whether a company went bankrupt or not) based on these key financial ratios. The prediction will be `0` (not bankrupt) or `1` (bankrupt), and the function will also return a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.08,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "S/TA": 0.75,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```
This means the company is predicted to go bankrupt (`1`), and all the conditions for the inner nodes were satisfied (`True`).
