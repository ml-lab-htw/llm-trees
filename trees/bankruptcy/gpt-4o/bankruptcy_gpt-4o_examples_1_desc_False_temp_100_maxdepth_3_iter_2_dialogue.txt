Here is the decision tree function based on the features you provided, returning a single prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes as described:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize a list with 3 None values for our inner nodes

    # Node 0: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.01
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.01

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        # Node 2: Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.1
        nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1

        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the nodes:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)** is less than or equal to 0.05. This is a common threshold for liquidity issues.
2. **Node 1**: If **WC/TA** is small (â‰¤ 0.05), then we check if **Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)** is less than or equal to 0.01, which is a sign of poor operational profitability. 
3. **Node 2**: If **WC/TA** is healthy (> 0.05), then we check **Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA)** to see if it is lower than or equal to 0.1, indicating poor cumulative profitability.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example feature input
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.03,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.02,
    "S/TA": 1.5,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.8
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Node values: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the prediction function will return whether the company is predicted to be bankrupt or not, and also provide the truth values for each decision node in the tree.
