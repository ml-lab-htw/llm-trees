Sure! Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features you provided. The decision tree will predict whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the feature **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)**, and it will return both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # The tree has a depth of 1, so we only need one node.
    
    # Node 0: Check if Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt (WC/TA <= 0.05)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt (WC/TA > 0.05)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: 
   - The function receives a dictionary `X` containing the values for each feature. The keys of the dictionary are exactly as provided: `'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, `'EBIT/TA'`, `'S/TA'`, and `'BVE/BVL'`.
   
2. **Nodes**:
   - The list `nodes` contains the result of the condition checked at each node. Since the tree has a maximum depth of 1, we only need one node (`nodes[0]`).
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)** ratio is less than or equal to 0.05. This is the key threshold that determines whether the company is likely to go bankrupt.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If `WC/TA <= 0.05`, the prediction is `1` (company went bankrupt).
   - If `WC/TA > 0.05`, the prediction is `0` (company did not go bankrupt).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns two values:
     - `prediction`: The bankruptcy prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt).
     - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value of each condition in the tree (in this case, just one condition).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input:
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.03,
    'RE/TA': 0.12,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.08,
    'S/TA': 1.20,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.50
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True]
```

In this example, the **WC/TA** value is `0.03`, which is less than or equal to `0.05`, so the company is classified as bankrupt (`prediction = 1`). The list `nodes` contains `[True]` since the condition was satisfied at the root node.
