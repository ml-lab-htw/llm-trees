Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 based on the Features you've provided:

Features:
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital/Total Assets
- **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
- **S/TA**: Sales/Total Assets
- **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

Target variable:
- **target**: company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### Decision Tree Code:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is WC/TA <= 0?
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0
    
    # Node 1: Is RE/TA <= -0.1?
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.1
    
    # Node 2: Is EBIT/TA <= 0.05?
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    # Node 3: Is S/TA <= 0.3?
    nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.3
    
    # Node 4: Is BVE/BVL <= 1.0?
    nodes[4] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 1.0
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If WC/TA <= 0
        if nodes[1]:  # If RE/TA <= -0.1
            if nodes[2]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05
                if nodes[3]:  # If S/TA <= 0.3
                    prediction = 1  # Company likely bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Company not likely bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Company likely bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # If BVE/BVL <= 1.0
                prediction = 1  # Company likely bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Company not likely bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[2]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05
            if nodes[4]:  # If BVE/BVL <= 1.0
                prediction = 1  # Company likely bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Company not likely bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company not likely bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- The decision tree has a depth of 5, with 5 inner nodes based on the conditions derived from the features you've provided.
- The tree structure is designed to identify whether a company went bankrupt based on financial ratios.
- The conditions are simple thresholds (e.g., "Is WC/TA <= 0?") that guide the decision-making process.
- The function returns two values:
  1. **prediction**: The predicted outcome (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = bankruptcy).
  2. **nodes**: A list of truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.

You can use this function by passing in a dictionary of features representing the company's financial metrics, like so:

```python
X_input = {
    "WC/TA": 0.05,
    "RE/TA": -0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "S/TA": 0.35,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.9
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will give you both the prediction and the state of the decision tree's nodes for the input values you provide.
