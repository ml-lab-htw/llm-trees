Below is the decision tree classifier function for the new set of features and the target variable "company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)":

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Decision rule based on the most important feature
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Company is more likely to go bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Company is less likely to go bankrupt
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree has a maximum depth of 1, meaning it has only 1 decision node (inner node).
- The decision rule is based on the feature `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets), which is a relevant indicator of a company's liquidity and financial health.
- If `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.1, the prediction is that the company will go bankrupt (`1`).
- Otherwise, the prediction is that the company will not go bankrupt (`0`).
- The `nodes` list keeps track of whether the condition in the decision node was satisfied (`1` if true, `0` if false).
