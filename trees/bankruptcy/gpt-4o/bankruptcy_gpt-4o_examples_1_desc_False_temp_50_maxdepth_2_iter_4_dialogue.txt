Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on your provided feature keys and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a company went bankrupt (1 = yes, 0 = no) based on financial features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): 0 if the company did not go bankrupt, 1 if it did.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied)
          for the decision tree's inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05  # First split based on Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10    # Second split based on Working Capital/Total Assets

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:  # If EBIT/TA > 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # If WC/TA <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # If WC/TA > 0.10
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The function accepts a dictionary `X` with the following keys:
   - `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital/Total Assets
   - `'RE/TA'`: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
   - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
   - `'S/TA'`: Sales/Total Assets
   - `'BVE/BVL'`: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks whether `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05 (first split).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks whether `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.10 (second split).

3. **Logic**:
   - If `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05 (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
   - Otherwise, if `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.05 (`nodes[0]` is `False`), the second condition is checked:
     - If `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.10 (`nodes[1]` is `True`), the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Otherwise, the company is classified as **Not Bankrupt** (`prediction = 0`).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = Not Bankrupt, 1 = Bankrupt).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the conditions in the decision tree.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.08,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.04,
    "S/TA": 0.50,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.20
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, True]
```

This function follows the structure of the decision tree and uses meaningful thresholds for the splits. Let me know if you need further clarification or modifications!
