Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the features and thresholds provided. The function will classify whether a company went bankrupt or not (`0 = no, 1 = yes`) and return the prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company went bankrupt or not based on financial features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if the company did not go bankrupt, 1 if it did.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05  # First condition: Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.10  # Second condition: Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the first condition is true
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:  # If the first condition is false
        if nodes[1]:  # Check the second condition
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Suppose we have the following input features for a company:

```python
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.04,   # Working Capital/Total Assets
    "RE/TA": 0.08,   # Retained Earnings/Total Assets
    "EBIT/TA": 0.12, # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
    "S/TA": 0.5,     # Sales/Total Assets
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2   # Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
}
```

We can use the `predict` function to classify the company:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Bankrupt)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Example:
1. The first condition (`WC/TA <= 0.05`) is `True` because `0.04 <= 0.05`.
2. Since the first condition is `True`, the decision tree immediately predicts `1` (Bankrupt), and the second condition is not evaluated further.

### Notes:
- The thresholds (`0.05` for `WC/TA` and `0.10` for `RE/TA`) were chosen based on meaningful values that can help separate bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies.
- The function is designed to handle dictionaries with the exact keys specified in the problem statement.
