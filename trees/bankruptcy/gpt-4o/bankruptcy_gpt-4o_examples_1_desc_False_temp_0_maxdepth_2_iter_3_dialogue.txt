Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a single prediction (`0` or `1`) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a company went bankrupt or not based on financial ratios.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
        - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
        - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
        - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
        - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if the company did not go bankrupt, 1 if it did.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize the list of nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    # Node 1: Check if 'RE/TA' <= -0.10 if Node 0 is True, otherwise check 'S/TA' <= 1.0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.10
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0
    
    # Make the prediction based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # 'EBIT/TA' <= 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # 'RE/TA' <= -0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # 'RE/TA' > -0.10
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # 'EBIT/TA' > 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # 'S/TA' <= 1.0
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # 'S/TA' > 1.0
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.1,
    "RE/TA": -0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.03,
    "S/TA": 0.8,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2
}

# Get the prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.05. If this condition is satisfied, the company is at higher risk of bankruptcy, and the decision moves to **Node 1**.
2. If **Node 0** is `True`, **Node 1** checks if `RE/TA` is less than or equal to -0.10. A negative retained earnings ratio indicates a higher likelihood of bankruptcy.
3. If **Node 0** is `False`, **Node 1** checks if `S/TA` is less than or equal to 1.0. Lower sales efficiency is associated with a higher risk of bankruptcy.
4. Based on the truth values of the nodes, the function makes a prediction (`0` = Not Bankrupt, `1` = Bankrupt).
