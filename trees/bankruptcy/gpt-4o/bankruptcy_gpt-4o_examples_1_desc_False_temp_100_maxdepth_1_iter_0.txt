Based on the Features and target variable, I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. Since the most important feature in predicting bankruptcy is often related to profitability or leverage, I will use the `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) ratio as the decision criterion. This ratio is a strong indicator of a company's profitability relative to its assets, and companies with a low or negative EBIT/TA ratio are more likely to face financial distress.

Here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] > 0.05  # Threshold based on profitability; adjust as necessary
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Company is not likely to go bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Company is likely to go bankrupt
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: This node checks whether the company's `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.05 (i.e., a 5% profitability threshold). If the company is generating a sufficient amount of earnings before interest and tax relative to its total assets, it is less likely to go bankrupt.
  - If `EBIT/TA > 0.05`, the company is predicted **not to go bankrupt** (prediction = 0).
  - If `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`, the company is predicted **to go bankrupt** (prediction = 1).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example data where EBIT/TA = 0.07 (7%)
features = {
    "WC/TA": 0.10,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.07,
    "S/TA": 0.20,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, since `EBIT/TA = 0.07` is greater than 0.05, the company is predicted **not to go bankrupt** (prediction = 0), and the node condition is satisfied (`nodes = [1]`).
