Based on the Features and target variable, here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features for predicting whether a company went bankrupt:

### Features:
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital/Total Assets
- **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
- **S/TA**: Sales/Total Assets
- **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

### Target variable:
- **target**: company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### Decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Is WC/TA <= -0.05?
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.05
    
    # Node 2: If Node 1 is True, check if RE/TA <= 0.1
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Company is likely to go bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company is not likely to go bankrupt
    else:
        # If Node 1 is False, check if EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Company is likely to go bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company is not likely to go bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 1**: The decision tree first checks if the company's **Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA)** is less than or equal to -0.05. A negative value typically indicates that the company has more current liabilities than current assets, which is a potential sign of financial distress.
  
- **Node 2**: If **WC/TA** is less than or equal to -0.05, the tree further checks if **Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA)** is less than or equal to 0.1. Low retained earnings relative to total assets suggest that the company has not accumulated much profit over time, which increases the likelihood of bankruptcy.

- If **WC/TA** is greater than -0.05, the decision is based on whether **Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA)** is less than or equal to 0.05. Low EBIT relative to total assets indicates that the company may not be generating enough operating income to cover its costs, which is another risk factor for bankruptcy.

### Usage Example:
```python
# Test the decision tree with an example input
example_input = {
    "WC/TA": -0.1,
    "RE/TA": 0.05,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.08,
    "S/TA": 0.2,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (likely to go bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

In this example, the company has a **WC/TA** of -0.1, so it satisfies the first condition (Node 1). The **RE/TA** is 0.05, which is less than 0.1, so it also satisfies the second condition (Node 2), resulting in a prediction that the company will go bankrupt (`prediction = 1`).
