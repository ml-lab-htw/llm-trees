Given the Features and target variable for predicting whether a company went bankrupt, here's a decision tree function with a maximum depth of 2. The decision tree uses the most important features based on intuition (though not trained on actual data) and returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

Features:
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital/Total Assets
- **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
- **S/TA**: Sales/Total Assets
- **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

Target variable:
- **target**: Company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Decision Tree Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: WC/TA <= 0.05 (Threshold chosen based on the intuition that low working capital relative to total assets might indicate financial stress)
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    # Second node: EBIT/TA <= 0.10 (Low earnings before interest and tax relative to total assets could be a sign of poor financial health)
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy if both WC/TA and EBIT/TA are low
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Lower risk if EBIT/TA is decent despite low WC/TA
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy if WC/TA is healthy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1**: The first decision point checks whether the working capital to total assets ratio (WC/TA) is less than or equal to 0.05. A low WC/TA ratio may indicate liquidity issues, which is a risk factor for bankruptcy.
2. **Node 2**: The second decision point checks whether the earnings before interest and tax to total assets ratio (EBIT/TA) is less than or equal to 0.10. Low EBIT/TA values may indicate poor profitability, another risk factor for bankruptcy.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.03,  # Low working capital relative to total assets
    "RE/TA": 0.15,  # Retained earnings relative to total assets
    "EBIT/TA": 0.08,  # Low profitability
    "S/TA": 0.25,  # Sales relative to total assets
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2  # Book value of equity relative to liabilities
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example:
- **prediction** would be `1` (high risk of bankruptcy) since both WC/TA <= 0.05 and EBIT/TA <= 0.10.
- **nodes** would be `[True, True]`, indicating that both conditions were satisfied.
