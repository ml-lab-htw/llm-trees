Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 based on the Features and target variable you provided:

Features:
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital/Total Assets
- **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
- **S/TA**: Sales/Total Assets
- **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

Target variable:
- **target**: Company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Is Working Capital/Total Assets <= 0.05?
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Is Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.10?
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.10
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: Is EBIT/TA <= 0.1?
            nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
    else:
        # Node 3: Is Sales/Total Assets <= 0.5?
        nodes[2] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.5
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1** checks if the company's Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) is less than or equal to 0.05. If true, it goes down the left branch; otherwise, it goes down the right branch.
   
2. **Node 2** checks Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) if the company has retained earnings less than or equal to -0.10. This is checked if the first node is true (i.e., WC/TA <= 0.05).
   
3. **Node 3** checks Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) if it is less than or equal to 0.1 when the second node is true. If this is also true, the company is predicted to have gone bankrupt. If false, the company is predicted to not go bankrupt.

4. If the first condition (WC/TA <= 0.05) is false, the model checks **Sales/Total Assets (S/TA)**. If Sales/Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.5, the company is predicted to have gone bankrupt; otherwise, it is predicted to not go bankrupt.

### Example:
```python
# Input features for a company
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.03,
    "RE/TA": -0.12,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.15,
    "S/TA": 0.45,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.8
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, False]
```

In this example:
- The first node condition (WC/TA ≤ 0.05) is satisfied (True),
- The second node condition (RE/TA ≤ -0.10) is satisfied (True),
- The third node condition (EBIT/TA ≤ 0.1) is not satisfied (False).

Thus, the company is predicted to **not go bankrupt** (0).
