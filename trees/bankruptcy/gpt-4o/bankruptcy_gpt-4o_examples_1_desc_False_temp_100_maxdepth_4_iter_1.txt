Sure! Based on the Features and the target variable, I will create a decision tree model with a maximum depth of 4. The decision tree will use the most important features to predict whether a company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

Here's the Python function with the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list for the nodes (depth 4)
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic based on important features
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] > -0.05
    nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] > 0.2
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] > 1.0

    # Decision based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bankruptcy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
1. **EBIT/TA**: If the company's Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) relative to its Total Assets is less than or equal to 0.1, it may indicate financial distress, so the decision tree checks this first.
2. **WC/TA**: Working Capital relative to Total Assets is checked next. Negative working capital is often a sign of liquidity problems.
3. **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings relative to Total Assets is used to assess long-term profitability and financial health.
4. **BVE/BVL**: The ratio of Book Value of Equity to Book Value of Liabilities assesses the company's leverage and solvency.

These conditions combine to make a prediction on whether the company is likely to go bankrupt (1) or not (0).

### Example usage:
```python
# Example input features
company_data = {
    "WC/TA": -0.1,
    "RE/TA": 0.15,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.05,
    "S/TA": 0.8,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.7
}

# Predict bankruptcy
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankruptcy)
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Example output: [True, False, False, False]
```

The `nodes` list contains the truth values for each decision node in the tree (True if the condition is satisfied, False otherwise).
