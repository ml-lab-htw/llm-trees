Given the Features and the target variable, I will create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4. The decision tree will use conditions based on the importance of features, and it will make a prediction based on whether a company went bankrupt or not.

Here’s the Python function formatted as a decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the company's Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) ratio less than or equal to 0.1?
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Is the company's Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) ratio less than or equal to 0.05?
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is the company’s Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) ratio less than or equal to 0.02?
            nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.02
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Is the company’s Sales/Total Assets (S/TA) ratio less than or equal to 0.15?
                nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.15
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
        else:
            # Node 2: Is the company’s Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL) ratio greater than 1?
            nodes[2] = X["BVE/BVL"] > 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
    else:
        # Node 1: Is the company’s Sales/Total Assets (S/TA) ratio greater than 0.25?
        nodes[1] = X["S/TA"] > 0.25
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is the company’s Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL) ratio greater than 0.8?
            nodes[2] = X["BVE/BVL"] > 0.8
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Is the company’s Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) ratio greater than 0.1?
                nodes[3] = X["RE/TA"] > 0.1
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Low risk of bankruptcy
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The decision tree starts by evaluating whether the company's EBIT/TA ratio is less than or equal to 0.1. This could be a sign of insufficient profitability relative to assets, which may indicate financial distress.
- **Node 1**: If EBIT/TA ≤ 0.1, it checks WC/TA to see if the company has very low working capital relative to assets (≤ 0.05), which could indicate liquidity problems.
- **Node 2**: Further checks are done on **RE/TA** (retained earnings) and **S/TA** (sales), which are essential indicators of long-term financial stability and operational efficiency.
- If EBIT/TA is greater than 0.1, the decision tree checks **S/TA** and **BVE/BVL** to evaluate the company's operational efficiency and balance between equity and liabilities.

This decision tree will classify a company as either being at **high risk of bankruptcy (1)** or **low risk of bankruptcy (0)** based on the financial ratios provided.
