Based on the Features provided, I will design a decision tree of depth 3 with a maximum of 7 inner nodes. The decision tree will use the most important features from the list to predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes).

### Features:
- **WC/TA**: Working Capital/Total Assets
- **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
- **S/TA**: Sales/Total Assets
- **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

### Target variable:
- **target**: company went bankrupt or not (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Here is the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check WC/TA (Working Capital to Total Assets)
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:  # WC/TA is low (<= 0.05)
        # Node 2: Check RE/TA (Retained Earnings to Total Assets)
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
        
        if nodes[1]:  # RE/TA is low (<= 0.1)
            # Node 3: Check EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax to Total Assets)
            nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA is low (<= 0.02)
                prediction = 1  # High risk of bankruptcy
            else:  # EBIT/TA is higher (> 0.02)
                prediction = 0  # Lower risk of bankruptcy
        else:  # RE/TA is higher (> 0.1)
            prediction = 0  # Lower risk of bankruptcy
    else:  # WC/TA is higher (> 0.05)
        # Node 3: Check S/TA (Sales to Total Assets)
        nodes[1] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0
        if nodes[1]:  # S/TA is low (<= 1.0)
            # Node 4: Check BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity to Book Value of Liabilities)
            nodes[2] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.5
            if nodes[2]:  # BVE/BVL is low (<= 0.5)
                prediction = 1  # Higher risk of bankruptcy
            else:  # BVE/BVL is higher (> 0.5)
                prediction = 0  # Lower risk of bankruptcy
        else:  # S/TA is higher (> 1.0)
            prediction = 0  # Lower risk of bankruptcy
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 1**: The decision tree first checks if the company's Working Capital to Total Assets (WC/TA) is low (<= 0.05). If it is, the company might have liquidity problems, increasing the risk of bankruptcy.
- **Node 2**: If WC/TA is low, the decision tree then checks Retained Earnings to Total Assets (RE/TA). If this is also low (<= 0.1), it indicates the company has been retaining less earnings, which is another indicator of financial instability.
- **Node 3**: If both WC/TA and RE/TA are low, the decision tree checks the Earnings Before Interest and Tax to Total Assets (EBIT/TA). If EBIT/TA is very low (<= 0.02), it suggests the company has low profitability, leading to a prediction of bankruptcy (1).
- **Node 4**: If WC/TA is not low, the decision tree checks Sales to Total Assets (S/TA). If S/TA is low (<= 1.0), it indicates low efficiency in utilizing assets to generate sales. The decision tree then checks Book Value of Equity to Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL). If BVE/BVL is low (<= 0.5), it indicates high leverage, which increases the risk of bankruptcy.

### Example usage:

```python
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.04,
    "RE/TA": 0.08,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.015,
    "S/TA": 0.9,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.6
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (bankruptcy)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True]
```

In this example, the company is predicted to go bankrupt (1), and all of the conditions for the inner nodes were satisfied (`[True, True, True]`).

### Summary:
This decision tree uses three features (WC/TA, RE/TA, EBIT/TA, S/TA, and BVE/BVL) and evaluates them in a hierarchical manner to predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not. The logic is based on financial ratios that measure liquidity, profitability, leverage, and asset efficiency, which are common risk factors for bankruptcy.
