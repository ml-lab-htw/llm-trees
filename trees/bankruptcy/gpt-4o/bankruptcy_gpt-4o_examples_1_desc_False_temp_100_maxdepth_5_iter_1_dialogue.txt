Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree that predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided financial features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.0
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If WC/TA <= 0.0 (potential liquidity issue)
        # Node 1: Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.1
        nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If RE/TA <= 0.1 (low retained earnings)
            # Node 2: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.05
            nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
            
            if nodes[2]:  # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05 (low profitability)
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05 (better profitability)
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:  # RE/TA > 0.1 (reasonable retained earnings)
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # WC/TA > 0.0 (positive working capital, healthier liquidity)
        # Node 3: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL) <= 0.5
        nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.5
        
        if nodes[3]:  # If BVE/BVL <= 0.5 (high leverage, risky)
            # Node 4: Sales/Total Assets (S/TA) <= 1.0
            nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0
            
            if nodes[4]:  # If S/TA <= 1.0 (inefficient asset use)
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # S/TA > 1.0 (efficient asset use)
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.5 (low leverage, financially healthier)
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes in a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (`'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, `'EBIT/TA'`, `'S/TA'`, `'BVE/BVL'`), and the values are the corresponding financial ratios.
- It evaluates the conditions of the decision tree step-by-step and stores whether each of them is satisfied in the `nodes` list (with `True` for satisfied and `False` for not satisfied).
- The decision logic follows the structure I previously outlined, with thresholds set to reasonable values based on financial distress prediction models.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: `1` if the company went bankrupt, `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the tree was satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input dictionary
example_input = {
    "WC/TA": -0.05,  # Negative working capital
    "RE/TA": 0.08,   # Low retained earnings
    "EBIT/TA": 0.03,  # Low profitability
    "S/TA": 1.2,     # High sales to assets ratio
    "BVE/BVL": 0.4   # High leverage
}

# Get prediction and truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True, None, None]
