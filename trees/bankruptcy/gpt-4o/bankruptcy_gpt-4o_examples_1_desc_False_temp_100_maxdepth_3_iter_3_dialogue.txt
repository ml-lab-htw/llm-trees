Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree based on the features you provided. It returns a prediction (0 for "not bankrupt" and 1 for "bankrupt") as well as a list of truth values representing the internal conditions at each node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # We have 4 decision nodes in this tree
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: WC/TA <= -0.1
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05 and WC/TA <= -0.1, the company is bankrupt
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If EBIT/TA <= 0.05 and WC/TA > -0.1, the company is not bankrupt
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 2: RE/TA <= 0.1
        nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
        
        if nodes[2]:
            # Node 3: S/TA <= 1.5
            nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.5
            
            if nodes[3]:
                # If EBIT/TA > 0.05, RE/TA <= 0.1, and S/TA <= 1.5, the company is bankrupt
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If EBIT/TA > 0.05, RE/TA <= 0.1, and S/TA > 1.5, the company is not bankrupt
                prediction = 0
        else:
            # If EBIT/TA > 0.05 and RE/TA > 0.1, the company is not bankrupt
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
- **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (`'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, `'EBIT/TA'`, `'S/TA'`, `'BVE/BVL'`), and the values are the respective numeric values for those features.
  
- **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each internal node. For example:
  - `nodes[0]` checks if `"EBIT/TA" <= 0.05`.
  - `nodes[1]` checks if `"WC/TA" <= -0.1` (if the condition at node 0 was satisfied).
  - `nodes[2]` checks if `"RE/TA" <= 0.1` (if the condition at node 0 was not satisfied).
  - `nodes[3]` checks if `"S/TA" <= 1.5` (if the condition at node 2 was satisfied).
  
- **Prediction**: The final prediction is based on the conditions in the tree, with `1` indicating the company is bankrupt and `0` indicating the company is not bankrupt.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "WC/TA": -0.05,
    "RE/TA": 0.08,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.03,
    "S/TA": 1.2,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.6
}

# Prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function simulates the decision-making process of a decision tree based on the financial ratios you've provided without using real data.
