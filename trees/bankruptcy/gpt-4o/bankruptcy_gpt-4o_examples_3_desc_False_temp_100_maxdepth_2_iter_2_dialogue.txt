Sure, let's create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 based on your provided features and target values:

### Decision Tree:
```
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.2
||--- class: Bankrupt
|--- Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) > 0.2
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.1
|||--- class: Bankrupt
||--- Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) > 0.1
|||--- class: Not Bankrupt
```

### Python Function:
Here is the decision tree model implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.2
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Input
features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.15,  # Example value for Working Capital/Total Assets
    'RE/TA': 0.05,  # Example value for Retained Earnings/Total Assets
    'EBIT/TA': 0.10, # Example value for Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
    'S/TA': 1.50,  # Example value for Sales/Total Assets
    'BVE/BVL': 0.8  # Example value for Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities
}

# Example Output
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Will print either 0 or 1 based on the input features
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Will print the list of truth values for inner nodes
```

### Explanation:

This function takes a dictionary `X` with feature keys as input and returns:
1. **Prediction**: `0` if the company did not go bankrupt or `1` if it did.
2. **Nodes**: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` becomes `1` (or `True`) if `X["WC/TA"] <= 0.2`; otherwise, it is `0` (or `False`).
   - `nodes[1]` becomes `1` (or `True`) if `X["WC/TA"] > 0.2` and `X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1`; otherwise, it is `0` (or `False`).

This simple model checks the most significant financial ratios to determine potential bankruptcy. The thresholds were chosen based on typical financial analysis, but in practical scenarios, they should be derived from a thorough statistical analysis of historical data.
