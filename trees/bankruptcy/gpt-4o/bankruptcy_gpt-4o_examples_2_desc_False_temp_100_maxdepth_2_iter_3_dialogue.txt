Let's construct the decision tree function for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided features. The decision tree will be limited to a depth of 2 using meaningful threshold values.

Here is the Python function as requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the nodes list to keep track of truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Defining the decision tree logic with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.15
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.07

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]** checks if `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.15.
- **nodes[1]** checks if `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.07, but only if **nodes[0]** is True.
- If `EBIT/TA` is greater than 0.15, the prediction is that the company did not go bankrupt (0).
- If `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.15 and `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.07, the prediction is that the company went bankrupt (1).
- If `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.15 and `WC/TA` is greater than 0.07, the prediction is that the company did not go bankrupt (0).

This function will return both the prediction and the truth values of the internal nodes used in making the prediction.
