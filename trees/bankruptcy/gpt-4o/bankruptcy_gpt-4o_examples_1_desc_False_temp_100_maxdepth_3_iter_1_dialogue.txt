### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a **dictionary `X`** where the keys are the feature names (e.g., `'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, etc.) and the values are the corresponding feature values.
- **`nodes`** is a list initialized to store whether the condition for each decision node is satisfied (`True` or `False`).
- The decision tree logic is built based on the conditions and thresholds we derived earlier.
- The function returns:
  1. **`prediction`**: 1 for bankruptcy (`yes`), 0 for no bankruptcy (`no`).
  2. **`nodes`**: A list of truth values indicating whether each decision node's condition is satisfied (`1` if satisfied, `0` otherwise).
