Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree you requested. It returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes in the decision tree, based on the features you provided. I have filled in the thresholds with reasonable values based on my understanding of financial ratios and their typical ranges.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= 0.05
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.04
        nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.04
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        # Node 3: Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.10
        nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.10
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1** checks if the company's **WC/TA** (Working Capital/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.05. If the liquidity is poor (i.e., WC/TA is very low), the company is more likely to struggle financially.
   
2. **Node 2** is evaluated if the company has poor liquidity. It checks if the company's **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.04. If both liquidity and profitability are weak, the company is predicted to be bankrupt.

3. If **WC/TA** is greater than 0.05 (i.e., good liquidity), the tree checks **RE/TA** (Retained Earnings/Total Assets). If **RE/TA** is less than or equal to 0.10, it means the company hasn't accumulated much profit, which is a bad sign. Otherwise, the company is likely not bankrupt.

### Example usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.03,
    'RE/TA': 0.12,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.02,
    'S/TA': 0.8,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.5
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Bankrupt)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```

This function provides both the final prediction (whether the company went bankrupt or not) and a list of Boolean values for the inner nodes, showing whether each condition was satisfied or not for the given input.
