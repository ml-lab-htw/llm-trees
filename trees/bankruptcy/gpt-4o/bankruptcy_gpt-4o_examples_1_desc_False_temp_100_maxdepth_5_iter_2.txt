Given the Features and target variable, here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 5. This is formatted as a Python function, and it returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets)
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05  # Threshold chosen to separate companies based on liquidity
    
    # Node 1: EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets)
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02  # Separating companies based on profitability
    
    # Node 2: RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)
    nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] > 0.10  # Retained earnings can indicate a company's financial health
    
    # Node 3: S/TA (Sales/Total Assets)
    nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] > 0.50  # Separating companies based on efficiency in generating revenue from assets
    
    # Node 4: BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities)
    nodes[4] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.80  # Financial stability based on equity relative to liabilities
    
    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the company's working capital, relative to its assets, is low (`WC/TA <= 0.05`). A low working capital ratio is often a sign of liquidity problems.
   
2. **Node 1**: If the company has liquidity issues, the next check is whether it is also low on profitability (`EBIT/TA <= 0.02`). Companies with low earnings relative to assets may be at risk of bankruptcy.

3. **Node 2**: Even if the company has low profitability, retained earnings can indicate long-term financial health (`RE/TA > 0.10`).

4. **Node 3**: If the company is generating a lot of sales relative to its assets (`S/TA > 0.50`), that may indicate financial efficiency, which could offset other risks.

5. **Node 4**: Finally, the ratio of the book value of equity to liabilities (`BVE/BVL <= 0.80`) gives an indication of solvency. A low ratio may suggest a higher risk of bankruptcy.

### Prediction:

- The function returns a **prediction** (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = bankruptcy) based on the conditions outlined above.
- It also returns a **list of truth values** (`nodes`), where each entry corresponds to whether the condition for that node was satisfied (1 = condition true, 0 = condition false). 

This decision tree is designed to make reasonable predictions based on financial ratios often used in bankruptcy prediction, within the constraints of a tree depth of 5.
