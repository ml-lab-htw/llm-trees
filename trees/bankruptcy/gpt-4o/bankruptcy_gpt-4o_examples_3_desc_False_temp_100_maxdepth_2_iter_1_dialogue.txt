Based on your specifications and the provided examples, here is the decision tree classifier in Python that aligns with the decision tree architecture you requested. The tree is built to a maximum depth of 2 using the specified financial ratios.

### Python Function for the Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.00
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
feature_input_example = {
    'WC/TA': -0.05,
    'RE/TA': -0.10,
    'EBIT/TA': -0.08,
    'S/TA': 1.20,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.75
}

prediction, nodes = predict(feature_input_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the financial ratios as input and returns the classification prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's how the function works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nodes` list is initialized with `None` values to store the results of the node conditions.
   
2. **Node Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.00`. 
   - The second condition checks if `RE/TA` is less than or equal to `0.10`.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If the first condition is satisfied (`nodes[0]`), the model predicts `Bankrupt` (`1`).
   - If the first condition is not satisfied, it proceeds to check the second condition:
     - If the second condition is satisfied (`nodes[1]`), the model predicts `Bankrupt` (`1`).
     - If neither condition is satisfied, the model predicts `Not Bankrupt` (`0`).

### Example Test Case:
For the example input provided, the output will be:
- **Prediction**: Bankrupt
- **Nodes**: [True, True]

This decision tree is simplistic and may need further refinements when applied to real-world data. The chosen thresholds for node splits can be fine-tuned to improve classification accuracy based on the specific dataset used.
