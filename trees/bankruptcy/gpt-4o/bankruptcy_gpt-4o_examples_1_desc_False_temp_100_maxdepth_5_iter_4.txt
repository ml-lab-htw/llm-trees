Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5, using the Features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize a list for the inner nodes, initially all None

    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05  # Working Capital/Total Assets
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
    nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] > 0.8  # Sales/Total Assets
    nodes[4] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 1.0  # Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Yes, bankruptcy
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Yes, bankruptcy
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Yes, bankruptcy
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Yes, bankruptcy
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No bankruptcy

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

- **Node 0 (Root Node)**: The tree first checks if the `RE/TA` ratio (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.1. This is usually an indicator of poor retained earnings relative to the companyâ€™s assets.
  
  - If `RE/TA <= 0.1`, we move down the left branch.
  - If `RE/TA > 0.1`, we move down the right branch.
  
- **Node 1**: In the left branch, the tree checks if the `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.05. This indicates low liquidity.

- **Node 2**: If the company has low working capital, then the next check is for a low `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets), where less than or equal to 0.03 could indicate poor profitability.

- **Node 3**: If the company has poor profitability but significant `S/TA` (Sales/Total Assets) greater than 0.8, this might reduce the likelihood of bankruptcy.

- **Node 4**: Lastly, if the `BVE/BVL` (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities) is less than or equal to 1, this suggests high leverage, increasing the chance of bankruptcy.

### Inputs:

- **WC/TA**: Working Capital / Total Assets
- **RE/TA**: Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- **EBIT/TA**: Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
- **S/TA**: Sales / Total Assets
- **BVE/BVL**: Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities

### Output:

- The function will return two things:
  1. **prediction**: A binary prediction indicating whether the company will go bankrupt (`0 = no`, `1 = yes`).
  2. **nodes**: A list representing whether each node's condition was satisfied (`1 = True`, `0 = False`).

Example of how you could call the function:

```python
features = {
    "WC/TA": 0.03,
    "RE/TA": 0.05,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.02,
    "S/TA": 0.9,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output the prediction and the state of the inner nodes based on the input feature values.
