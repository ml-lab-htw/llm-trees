Hereâ€™s a Python function implementing the decision tree logic you specified. The function will return both the prediction (whether the company went bankrupt or not) and a list of truth values representing whether the condition at each node was satisfied. I have used thresholds that make sense based on typical financial analysis for each feature.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of nodes (inner conditions)
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: EBIT/TA <= 0.03
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.03
        # Node 1: WC/TA <= -0.05
        nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.05
        
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= -0.05
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > -0.05
            # Node 2: RE/TA <= 0.02
            nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.02
            
            if nodes[2]:  # RE/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # RE/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.03
        # Node 3: S/TA <= 0.85
        nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.85
        
        if nodes[3]:  # S/TA <= 0.85
            # Node 4: BVE/BVL <= 0.50
            nodes.append(X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.50)
            
            if nodes[4]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.50
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.50
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:  # S/TA > 0.85
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

1. **Input**: The function `predict(X: dict)` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (`WC/TA`, `RE/TA`, `EBIT/TA`, `S/TA`, `BVE/BVL`) and the values are the corresponding financial ratios of a company.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks whether `EBIT/TA` (profitability) is less than or equal to 0.03. Low profitability is a red flag for potential bankruptcy, so this forms the root of the decision tree.
   - `nodes[1]`: If profitability is low, check whether `WC/TA` (liquidity) is less than or equal to -0.05. Negative working capital indicates a liquidity crisis, which increases the risk of bankruptcy.
   - `nodes[2]`: If `WC/TA` is better, check `RE/TA` (retained earnings). Low retained earnings suggest the company hasn't accumulated much profit over time, increasing bankruptcy risk.
   - `nodes[3]`: If `EBIT/TA` is higher, check `S/TA` (asset efficiency). Low sales relative to total assets may indicate inefficiency.
   - `nodes[4]`: If `S/TA` is low, check `BVE/BVL` (leverage). A low ratio indicates high leverage, increasing financial risk.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the company satisfies conditions that indicate financial distress (such as low profitability, liquidity, or high leverage), the function predicts `1` (bankrupt).
   - Otherwise, it predicts `0` (not bankrupt).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple with two values:
     - `prediction`: The predicted class (1 for bankrupt, 0 for not bankrupt).
     - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing whether the condition at each node was satisfied (`True` or `False`).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input financial ratios
X = {
    "WC/TA": -0.10,
    "RE/TA": 0.01,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.02,
    "S/TA": 0.70,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.40
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Bankrupt)
print("Node Conditions Satisfied:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, None, None, None]
```

This implementation allows you to get both the prediction and the decision path (via `nodes`), which is useful for understanding how the tree reached its decision.
