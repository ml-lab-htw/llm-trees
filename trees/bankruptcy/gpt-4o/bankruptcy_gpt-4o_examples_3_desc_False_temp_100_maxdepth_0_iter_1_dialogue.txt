Sure, let's implement the decision tree as a Python function that predicts whether a company went bankrupt based on the provided features. The function will also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.15
    nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.50

    if nodes[0]:      # WC/TA <= 0.20
        prediction = 1
    else:             # WC/TA > 0.20
        if nodes[1]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.15
            prediction = 1
        else:         # EBIT/TA > 0.15
            if nodes[2]:  # RE/TA <= 0.05
                prediction = 1
            else:         # RE/TA > 0.05
                if nodes[3]:  # S/TA <= 1.50
                    prediction = 1
                else:         # S/TA > 1.50
                    prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage:
features = {
    'WC/TA': 0.25,
    'RE/TA': 0.10,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.20,
    'S/TA': 1.60,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.80  # Note: 'BVE/BVL' is not used in this simplified tree
}

prediction, truth_nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Truth Nodes: {truth_nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if `WC/TA` is less than or equal to `0.20`.
2. **Node 1**: If `WC/TA` is greater than `0.20`, checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.15`.
3. **Node 2**: If `EBIT/TA` is greater than `0.15`, checks if `RE/TA` is less than or equal to `0.05`.
4. **Node 3**: If `RE/TA` is greater than `0.05`, checks if `S/TA` is less than or equal to `1.50`.

The decision tree ultimately classifies companies based on these conditions, and if any condition indicating potential financial distress is met (`Bankrupt` is predicted). The nodes list captures the truth values for each decision point, which will help in debugging and understanding the path taken for the final classification.

You can now call the `predict` function with a dictionary of feature values to get both the prediction and the list of truth values for all nodes.
