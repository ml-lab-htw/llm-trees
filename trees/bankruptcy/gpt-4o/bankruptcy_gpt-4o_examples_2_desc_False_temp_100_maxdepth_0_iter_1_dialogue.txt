Here is a Python function that implements a decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not based on the provided features. The function returns a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.1
    nodes[2] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.3
    nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 1.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= -0.1
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # RE/TA <= 0.05
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.3
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # S/TA <= 1.0
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt
                
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'WC/TA': -0.05,
    'RE/TA': 0.02,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.06,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function, the decision tree implements the hierarchical structure described, with each inner node condition tested in sequence. The `nodes` list captures whether each condition was satisfied (`1` if true, `0` if false). The prediction is based on navigating through these conditions.

The example usage shows how to pass a feature dictionary to the function and get back the prediction as well as the states of the inner nodes. The example prediction will print whether the company went bankrupt or not based on the provided feature values.
