The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a single prediction (0 = Not Bankrupt, 1 = Bankrupt) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.0
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax divided by Total Assets.
  - `"WC/TA"`: Working Capital divided by Total Assets.

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to 0.0.
    - **Interpretation:** A company with non-positive EBIT relative to its assets is likely not profitable, indicating financial distress.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `WC/TA` is less than or equal to 0.2.
    - **Interpretation:** Low working capital relative to assets suggests liquidity issues, increasing bankruptcy risk.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`):**
     - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., `EBIT/TA` ≤ 0.0), the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
  2. **Else**, proceed to the second node:
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True` (i.e., `WC/TA` ≤ 0.2), the company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else, the company is classified as **Not Bankrupt** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a company with the following financial ratios:

```python
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "RE/TA": 0.35,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.05,
    "S/TA": 1.2,
    "BVE/BVL": 0.8
}
```

We can predict the bankruptcy status as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bankrupt
Nodes: [False, True]
```

- **Interpreting the Output:**
  - `Nodes: [False, True]` indicates:
    - `nodes[0]`: `False` (since `EBIT/TA` > 0.0)
    - `nodes[1]`: `True` (since `WC/TA` ≤ 0.2)
  - The company is predicted to be **Bankrupt** due to low working capital relative to total assets.

**Note on Threshold Values:**

- The thresholds used (`0.0` for `EBIT/TA` and `0.2` for `WC/TA`) are meaningful and based on financial analysis principles.
  - **`EBIT/TA` Threshold (`0.0`):** Separates companies with non-positive operational earnings from those generating profits.
  - **`WC/TA` Threshold (`0.2`):** Distinguishes between companies with low and adequate liquidity levels.

Please ensure that when using the function, the feature names in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the keys provided:

```python
['WC/TA', 'RE/TA', 'EBIT/TA', 'S/TA', 'BVE/BVL']
```

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0` = Not Bankrupt
  - `1` = Bankrupt

**Final Remarks:**

- This function implements a simple decision tree classifier of maximum depth 2, using the most important features to predict bankruptcy.
- The use of `nodes` helps trace the decision path taken for each prediction, which can be useful for understanding and debugging the model's behavior.
