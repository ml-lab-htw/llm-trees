Certainly! Based on your specifications and the decision tree provided, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['RE/TA'] <= 0.10)
    nodes[2] = int(X['WC/TA'] <= 0.20)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** Contains truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `EBIT/TA <= 0.0`
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `RE/TA <= 0.10`
  - `nodes[2]` corresponds to the condition `WC/TA <= 0.20`

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (i.e., `EBIT/TA <= 0.0`), **then** `prediction = 1` (Bankrupt).
  - **Else**:
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is `1` (`RE/TA <= 0.10`), **then** `prediction = 1` (Bankrupt).
    - **Else**:
      - **If** `nodes[2]` is `1` (`WC/TA <= 0.20`), **then** `prediction = 1` (Bankrupt).
      - **Else** `prediction = 0` (Not Bankrupt).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.25,
    'RE/TA': 0.15,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.05,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.5
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Bankrupt" if prediction == 1 else "Not Bankrupt")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Not Bankrupt
Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - Pay close attention to the exact spelling and casing of the keys:
    - `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital / Total Assets
    - `'RE/TA'`: Retained Earnings / Total Assets
    - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
    - `'S/TA'`: Sales / Total Assets
    - `'BVE/BVL'`: Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: Company did **not** go bankrupt.
  - `1`: Company **went** bankrupt.

- **Thresholds:**
  - The thresholds are based on meaningful financial ratios commonly used to assess bankruptcy risk.
    - `EBIT/TA <= 0.0`: Indicates the company isn't generating operating profits.
    - `RE/TA <= 0.10`: Low retained earnings suggest poor long-term profitability.
    - `WC/TA <= 0.20`: Low working capital indicates potential liquidity issues.

- **Interpretation of Nodes List:**
  - Each element in the `nodes` list is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
    - For the sample input above:
      - `nodes[0] = 0` because `EBIT/TA` (0.05) is **not** less than or equal to `0.0`.
      - `nodes[1] = 0` because `RE/TA` (0.15) is **not** less than or equal to `0.10`.
      - `nodes[2] = 0` because `WC/TA` (0.25) is **not** less than or equal to `0.20`.

**Conclusion:**

This function allows you to input a dictionary of financial ratios for a company and returns:

- The `prediction`: Whether the company is predicted to go bankrupt (`1`) or not (`0`).
- The `nodes` list: Which conditions in the decision tree were satisfied.

This can be used to trace the decision path taken for each prediction.
