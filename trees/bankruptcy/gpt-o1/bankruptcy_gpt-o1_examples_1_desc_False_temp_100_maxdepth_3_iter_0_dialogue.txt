Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.04
    nodes[2] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.10

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values for each condition in the decision tree:

  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `WC/TA <= 0.04`.
  - `nodes[2]` corresponds to the condition `RE/TA <= 0.10`.

- **Decision Logic:**

  - **First Condition (`nodes[0]`):**

    - If `EBIT/TA <= 0.05` (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the company might be at risk.
      - **Second Condition (`nodes[1]`):**
        - If `WC/TA <= 0.04` (`nodes[1]` is `True`), predict `1` (Bankrupt).
        - Else (`nodes[1]` is `False`), predict `0` (Not Bankrupt).
    - This branch focuses on companies with low profitability relative to their total assets and checks their liquidity position.

  - **Else (`nodes[0]` is `False`):**

    - The company has acceptable `EBIT/TA`, so we check accumulated earnings.
      - **Third Condition (`nodes[2]`):**
        - If `RE/TA <= 0.10` (`nodes[2]` is `True`), predict `1` (Bankrupt).
        - Else (`nodes[2]` is `False`), predict `0` (Not Bankrupt).
    - This branch assesses whether the company has retained enough earnings over time.

- **Return Values:**

  - `prediction`: The predicted class, where `0` means the company did **not** go bankrupt, and `1` means the company **did** go bankrupt.
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values `[nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2]]`, indicating whether each condition was satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a company with the following financial ratios:

```python
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.03,
    'RE/TA': 0.08,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.04,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Bankrupt)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True, True, False]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `True` because `EBIT/TA` (0.04) ≤ 0.05.
- `nodes[1]` is `True` because `WC/TA` (0.03) ≤ 0.04.
- `nodes[2]` is `False` (not evaluated in this path, but assigned for consistency).

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with exact spelling and case sensitivity as specified:

  ```python
  ['WC/TA', 'RE/TA', 'EBIT/TA', 'S/TA', 'BVE/BVL']
  ```

- The function assumes that all necessary financial ratios are provided in the input dictionary.

- The thresholds used in the conditions are meaningful values based on typical financial analysis for bankruptcy prediction.
