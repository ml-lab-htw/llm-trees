Sure! Based on the provided decision tree and features, here is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values (with the exact keys as specified) and returns the prediction (`0` for not bankrupt, `1` for bankrupt) along with a list of booleans indicating the truth values of each inner node's condition.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.0
    if nodes[0]:  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets <= 0.0
        # Node 1
        nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= -0.2
        if nodes[1]:  # Working Capital/Total Assets <= -0.2
            # Prediction: Bankrupt
            prediction = 1
            nodes[2] = None  # Nodes beyond this point are not evaluated
            nodes[3] = None
            nodes[4] = None
        else:  # Working Capital/Total Assets > -0.2
            # Prediction: Bankrupt
            prediction = 1
            nodes[2] = None
            nodes[3] = None
            nodes[4] = None
    else:  # Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets > 0.0
        nodes[1] = None  # This node is not evaluated in this branch
        # Node 2
        nodes[2] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.2
        if nodes[2]:  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= 0.2
            # Node 3
            nodes[3] = X['S/TA'] <= 1.0
            if nodes[3]:  # Sales/Total Assets <= 1.0
                # Prediction: Bankrupt
                prediction = 1
                nodes[4] = None  # Nodes beyond this point are not evaluated
            else:  # Sales/Total Assets > 1.0
                # Prediction: Not Bankrupt
                prediction = 0
                nodes[4] = None
        else:  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets > 0.2
            # Prediction: Not Bankrupt
            prediction = 0
            nodes[3] = None  # These nodes are not evaluated in this branch
            nodes[4] = None

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input
X_sample = {
    'WC/TA': -0.25,
    'RE/TA': 0.15,
    'EBIT/TA': -0.05,
    'S/TA': 0.8,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.6
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {'Bankrupt' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Bankrupt'}")
print("Node evaluations:", nodes)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):** Each element in the `nodes` list corresponds to the truth value (`True` or `False`) of the condition at a specific node in the decision tree. A `None` value indicates that the node was not evaluated (i.e., it was not reached during the prediction for the given input).
- **Conditions:**
  - **Node 0:** `X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.0`
  - **Node 1:** `X['WC/TA'] <= -0.2` (evaluated only if Node 0 is `True`)
  - **Node 2:** `X['RE/TA'] <= 0.2` (evaluated only if Node 0 is `False`)
  - **Node 3:** `X['S/TA'] <= 1.0` (evaluated only if Node 2 is `True`)
  - **Node 4:** Not used in this tree but included for consistency (maximum depth of 5)

**Note:** The thresholds used in the conditions (e.g., `0.0`, `-0.2`, `0.2`, `1.0`) are meaningful values based on typical financial ratios and are filled in to reflect a realistic decision tree.
