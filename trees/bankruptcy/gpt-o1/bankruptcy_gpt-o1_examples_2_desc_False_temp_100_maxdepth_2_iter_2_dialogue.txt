        else:

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values with keys:
  - `"WC/TA"`: Working Capital / Total Assets
  - `"EBIT/TA"`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
  - (Other features can be included in `X`, but are not used in this tree.)

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision node (`"WC/TA" <= 0.20`).
    - `nodes[0] = 1` if the condition is **True**.
    - `nodes[0] = 0` if the condition is **False**.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision node (`"EBIT/TA" <= 0.05`).
    - Evaluated only if the first condition is **False**.
    - `nodes[1] = 1` if the condition is **True**.
    - `nodes[1] = 0` if the condition is **False**.
    - If not evaluated, `nodes[1] = None`.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  1. **First Decision Node (`nodes[0]`):**
     - If `X["WC/TA"] <= 0.20` (`nodes[0] == 1`):
       - Predict **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
       - `nodes[1]` is set to `None` since the next node is not evaluated.
     - Else (`nodes[0] == 0`):
       - Proceed to evaluate the second node.

  2. **Second Decision Node (`nodes[1]`):**
     - If `X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05` (`nodes[1] == 1`):
       - Predict **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else (`nodes[1] == 0`):
       - Predict **Not Bankrupt** (`prediction = 0`).

- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: The class label (0 = Not Bankrupt, 1 = Bankrupt).
  - `nodes`: A list indicating which conditions were satisfied:
    - `1` if a condition is **True**.
    - `0` if a condition is **False**.
    - `None` if a condition was not evaluated.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example feature vector
X_example = {
    "WC/TA": 0.15,
    "RE/TA": 0.10,
    "EBIT/TA": 0.08,
    "S/TA": 0.50,
    "BVE/BVL": 1.2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Interpreting the Result:**

- If `prediction` is `1`, the company is predicted to have **gone bankrupt**.
- If `prediction` is `0`, the company is predicted to have **not gone bankrupt**.
- The `nodes` list helps trace which conditions led to the prediction.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the required keys with correctly formatted values.
- The thresholds (`0.20` and `0.05`) are based on financial analysis and are used to determine the risk levels associated with the financial ratios.
- This function implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using the most important features to classify bankruptcy risk.
