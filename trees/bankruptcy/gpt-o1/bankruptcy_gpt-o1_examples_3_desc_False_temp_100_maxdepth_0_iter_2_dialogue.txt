Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the financial ratios you've provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the exact feature keys as specified and returns a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.1
    nodes[2] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets) is less than or equal to **0.0**.
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if **RE/TA** (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) is less than or equal to **0.1**.
- **nodes[2]:** Checks if **WC/TA** (Working Capital / Total Assets) is less than or equal to **0.05**.

**Feature Keys and Descriptions:**

- **'WC/TA':** Working Capital / Total Assets
- **'RE/TA':** Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- **'EBIT/TA':** Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
- **'S/TA':** Sales / Total Assets
- **'BVE/BVL':** Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities

**Target Variable:**

- **company went bankrupt or not:** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.06,
    'RE/TA': 0.12,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.08,
    'S/TA': 1.5,      # Not used in this decision tree
    'BVE/BVL': 0.9    # Not used in this decision tree
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Print the results
print("Prediction:", "Bankrupt" if prediction == 1 else "Not Bankrupt")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Not Bankrupt
Node Truth Values: [False, False, False]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **nodes[0]:** `False` because `EBIT/TA` (0.08) > 0.0
- **nodes[1]:** `False` because `RE/TA` (0.12) > 0.1
- **nodes[2]:** `False` because `WC/TA` (0.06) > 0.05
- **Prediction:** `0` (Not Bankrupt), since none of the conditions for bankruptcy were met.

**Notes:**

- The decision tree uses the most significant features based on their importance in predicting bankruptcy.
- The features **'S/TA'** and **'BVE/BVL'** are provided but not used in this particular decision tree.
- Pay close attention to the exact spelling and case of the feature keys when using the function.

**Function Structure:**

The function follows the structure you specified:

- Initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
- Evaluates conditions using the exact feature keys.
- Uses nested `if` statements to navigate through the decision tree based on the conditions.
- Returns the final prediction and the list of node truth values.
