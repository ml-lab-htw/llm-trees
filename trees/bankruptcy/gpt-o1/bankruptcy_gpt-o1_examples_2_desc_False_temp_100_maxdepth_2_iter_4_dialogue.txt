```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.0
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.1

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 0 condition is True: EBIT/TA <= 0.0
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        # Node 0 condition is False: EBIT/TA > 0.0
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 1 condition is True: RE/TA <= 0.1
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            # Node 1 condition is False: RE/TA > 0.1
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if **EBIT/TA** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.0.
  - If **True**, the company is predicted to be **Bankrupt**.
  - If **False**, proceed to the next node.
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if **RE/TA** (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) is less than or equal to 0.1.
  - If **True**, the company is predicted to be **Bankrupt**.
  - If **False**, the company is predicted to be **Not Bankrupt**.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a company's financial ratios as follows:

```python
X = {
    "WC/TA": 0.05,    # Working Capital / Total Assets
    "RE/TA": 0.08,    # Retained Earnings / Total Assets
    "EBIT/TA": -0.02, # Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
    "S/TA": 1.2,      # Sales / Total Assets
    "BVE/BVL": 0.6    # Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Bankrupt" if prediction == 1 else "Not Bankrupt")
print("Decision Path:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bankrupt
Decision Path: [True, True]
```

This means:

- **nodes[0] == True:** `EBIT/TA <= 0.0` (EBIT/TA is -0.02)
- The company is predicted to be **Bankrupt** without evaluating **nodes[1]**, as per the decision tree logic.

**Threshold Justification:**

- **EBIT/TA <= 0.0:** A zero or negative EBIT/TA indicates that the company is not generating positive earnings from its assets, which is a critical warning sign.
- **RE/TA <= 0.1:** Retained Earnings relative to Total Assets being 10% or less suggests the company hasn't accumulated sufficient earnings over time, indicating potential financial distress.

**Note on Implementation:**

- The function strictly follows the provided decision tree and uses the exact keys and thresholds.
- It returns:
  - **prediction:** An integer where `0` means **Not Bankrupt** and `1` means **Bankrupt**.
  - **nodes:** A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the decision nodes in the tree.

**Important:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary keys with correctly formatted numerical values.
- The thresholds used are meaningful based on typical financial analysis and ratios used in bankruptcy prediction models.
