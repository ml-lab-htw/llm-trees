Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05)

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        prediction = 1  # Company went bankrupt (1 = yes)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Company did not go bankrupt (0 = no)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function Input:** A dictionary `X` containing the feature values with the exact keys:
  - `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital / Total Assets
  - `'RE/TA'`: Retained Earnings / Total Assets
  - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
  - `'S/TA'`: Sales / Total Assets
  - `'BVE/BVL'`: Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities

- **Decision Logic:**
  - The most important feature is `'EBIT/TA'`.
  - The condition checks if `'EBIT/TA'` is less than or equal to **0.05** (5%).
    - If the condition is **satisfied** (`nodes[0] == 1`), the company is predicted to have **gone bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If the condition is **not satisfied** (`nodes[0] == 0`), the company is predicted to have **not gone bankrupt** (`prediction = 0`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes` is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
  - In this case, `nodes[0]` corresponds to the root node condition: `'EBIT/TA'` ≤ 0.05.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example feature input
X = {
    'WC/TA': 0.1,
    'RE/TA': 0.05,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.04,
    'S/TA': 0.8,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.2
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - The company has an `'EBIT/TA'` of **0.04**, which is less than or equal to **0.05**.
  - The condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), so the company is predicted to have **gone bankrupt** (`prediction == 1`).

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the exact keys as specified. The function will return the prediction and a list indicating which conditions were met during the decision process.
