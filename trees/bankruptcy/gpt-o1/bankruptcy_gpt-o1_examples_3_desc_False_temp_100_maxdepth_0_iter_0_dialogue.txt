Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a company went bankrupt or not. The function returns a single prediction (`0` for "Not Bankrupt", `1` for "Bankrupt") and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the `nodes` list is `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Evaluate the conditions (inner nodes)
    nodes[0] = int(X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05)
    nodes[1] = int(X['RE/TA'] <= 0.10)

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Node 0: EBIT/TA ≤ 0.05
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Node 1: RE/TA ≤ 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**
  - `'WC/TA'`: Working Capital/Total Assets
  - `'RE/TA'`: Retained Earnings/Total Assets
  - `'EBIT/TA'`: Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
  - `'S/TA'`: Sales/Total Assets
  - `'BVE/BVL'`: Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

- **Target Variable:**
  - `company went bankrupt or not` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

- **Inner Nodes Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `EBIT/TA` is less than or equal to `0.05`.
    - This condition evaluates the company's profitability relative to its assets. A low `EBIT/TA` ratio suggests poor profitability and potential financial distress.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `RE/TA` is less than or equal to `0.10`.
    - This condition assesses the company's accumulated retained earnings relative to its assets. A low `RE/TA` ratio indicates limited retained earnings, which can be a warning sign for bankruptcy risk.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (i.e., `EBIT/TA` ≤ `0.05`):
    - The company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Else:**
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is `1` (i.e., `RE/TA` ≤ `0.10`):
      - The company is classified as **Bankrupt** (`prediction = 1`).
    - **Else:**
      - The company is classified as **Not Bankrupt** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose you have the following company data:

```python
company_data = {
    'WC/TA': 0.05,
    'RE/TA': 0.08,
    'EBIT/TA': 0.04,
    'S/TA': 1.2,
    'BVE/BVL': 0.9
}
```

You can predict whether the company went bankrupt as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print("Prediction:", "Bankrupt" if prediction == 1 else "Not Bankrupt")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bankrupt
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 1`: The condition `EBIT/TA ≤ 0.05` is **satisfied**.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The condition `RE/TA ≤ 0.10` is **satisfied**.
- Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, the company is predicted as **Bankrupt**.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the exact keys specified:
  - `'WC/TA'`, `'RE/TA'`, `'EBIT/TA'`, `'S/TA'`, `'BVE/BVL'`
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic provided, focusing on the most significant features impacting bankruptcy prediction.
