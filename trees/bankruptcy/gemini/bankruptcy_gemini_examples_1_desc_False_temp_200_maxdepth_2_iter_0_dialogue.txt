**Explanation of Threshold Choices:**

* **`EBIT/TA <= -0.05`:** A negative EBIT/TA indicates that a company is losing money on its core operations.  While a slightly negative value might be temporary, a value of -0.05 (or -5% return on assets) suggests more significant financial distress and a higher likelihood of bankruptcy.

* **`BVE/BVL <= 1.0`:**  A BVE/BVL less than or equal to 1 means that the company's liabilities are greater than or equal to its equity. This indicates a weak financial position where the company may not have enough assets to cover its debts, increasing the risk of bankruptcy.


**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {'WC/TA': 0.2, 'RE/TA': -0.1, 'EBIT/TA': -0.1, 'S/TA': 1.5, 'BVE/BVL': 0.5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]

X = {'WC/TA': 0.3, 'RE/TA': 0.2, 'EBIT/TA': 0.1, 'S/TA': 1.2, 'BVE/BVL': 1.2}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```
