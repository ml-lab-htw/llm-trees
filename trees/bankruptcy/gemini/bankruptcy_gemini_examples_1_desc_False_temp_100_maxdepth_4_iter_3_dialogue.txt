This function mirrors the structure of the hypothetical decision tree outlined in the previous response, using the specified feature names and bankruptcy encoding (0 = no, 1 = yes). The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each inner node, providing insights into the decision path taken for a given input.  Remember that this is still a hypothetical tree and the threshold values would need to be learned from real-world data in a practical application.
