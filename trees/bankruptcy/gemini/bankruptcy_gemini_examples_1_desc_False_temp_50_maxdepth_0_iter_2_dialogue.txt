Key improvements:

* **Clearer structure:** The `if/else` statements now directly reflect the decision tree logic, enhancing readability.
* **Specific thresholds:** Realistic threshold values are incorporated for each split, based on typical financial analysis.
* **Correct feature names:**  The code uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Docstrings:**  A docstring is included to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return values, improving code maintainability.
* **Example Usage:**  Included example usage showing how to call the function and interpret the output.


This function now accurately represents the hypothetical decision tree and provides both the prediction and the intermediate node truth values. Remember that this is still a simplified example. A real-world model would benefit from more data and potentially a more complex tree structure.
