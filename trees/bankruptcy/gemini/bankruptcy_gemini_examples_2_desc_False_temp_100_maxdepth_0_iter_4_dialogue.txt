**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - `predict(X: dict)`: Defines the function named `predict`, taking a dictionary `X` as input (containing feature values).
   - `nodes = 4 * [None]`: Initializes a list called `nodes` to store the truth values of inner node conditions (we have 4 inner nodes in this example).

2. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - **Thresholds:** The code includes example thresholds (e.g., `-0.10`, `0.05`, `1.2`). These are placeholders and **must be replaced with meaningful values** obtained from analyzing your bankruptcy dataset. 
   - **Conditions and Predictions:** The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision tree's branches. Each condition checks if a feature value meets a specific threshold, leading to a prediction (0 or 1 for not bankrupt or bankrupt, respectively).

3. **Return Values:**
   - `prediction (int)`: The predicted class label (0 or 1).
   - `nodes (list)`: A list representing the truth values of each inner node's condition (1 if true, 0 if false) during the prediction process.

**Important:**

- **Data-Driven Thresholds:** This example provides a structure. You **must** replace the placeholder thresholds with values learned from your bankruptcy data. Use a decision tree algorithm (like those mentioned earlier) to find optimal splits based on your data.
- **Feature Importance:** The order and choice of features in the conditions also depend on your data. Feature importance analysis can guide you in building a more accurate tree. 

Please provide your dataset or sample data, and I can help you train a decision tree model and determine appropriate thresholds for this specific bankruptcy prediction problem.
