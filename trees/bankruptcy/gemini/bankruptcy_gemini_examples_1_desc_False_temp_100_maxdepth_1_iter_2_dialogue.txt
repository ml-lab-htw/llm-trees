```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth 1
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.0  # Threshold set to 0: negative EBIT/TA suggests likely bankruptcy

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Predicted bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Predicted not bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```
