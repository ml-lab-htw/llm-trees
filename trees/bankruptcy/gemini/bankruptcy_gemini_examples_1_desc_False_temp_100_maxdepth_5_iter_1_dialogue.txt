def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.10
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= -0.15
    nodes[3] = X['S/TA'] <= 0.5

        else:

                prediction = 1 # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0 # Non-Bankrupt

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Feature Keys:** Uses the exact feature keys provided (e.g., 'WC/TA', 'RE/TA').
* **Target Encoding:**  The `prediction` is 0 for Non-Bankrupt and 1 for Bankrupt, as specified.
* **Threshold Values:**  Filled in placeholder thresholds with reasonable values based on general financial interpretation.  For example, low `WC/TA` (<= 0.05), negative `RE/TA` (<= -0.10), and negative `EBIT/TA` (<= -0.15) are considered higher risk.
* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the boolean truth values of each decision node's condition.  The length of the list now accurately reflects the number of inner nodes in the decision tree structure.
* **Clarity and Structure:**  The code is more clearly structured to match the branching logic of the decision tree.



This function now directly implements the hypothetical decision tree logic and returns the prediction and the inner node truth values as requested.  Remember that this is still a *simplified* example, and a real-world model would require training on actual data.
