```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10  # Working Capital/Total Assets threshold
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.05  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets threshold

    if nodes[0]:  # Low Working Capital
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:  # Healthy Working Capital
        if nodes[1]:  # Low Retained Earnings
            prediction = 1 # Bankrupt
        else:  # Healthy Retained Earnings
            prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've used 0.10 for "WC/TA" and 0.05 for "RE/TA" as reasonable thresholds based on general financial analysis principles.  Low or negative values for these ratios often suggest financial distress. These would need to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis.
* **Clarity:** The code is more clearly commented to explain the logic behind each decision.
* **Consistency:** The target variable encoding (0 = no bankruptcy, 1 = bankruptcy) is consistently applied.
* **No Unused Features:** The function only uses the specified features ("WC/TA" and "RE/TA") and ignores the others, as instructed.
* **Direct Mapping to Decision Tree:**  The `if/else` structure directly reflects the branches of the described decision tree.


This function now takes a dictionary `X` of feature values as input and returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` indicating which branches of the tree were taken.  This makes it easier to understand the decision-making process of the tree.  Remember that this is a simplified example, and real-world bankruptcy prediction models require more sophisticated techniques and data analysis.
