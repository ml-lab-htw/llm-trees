**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've used hypothetical thresholds (-0.10, 0.05, and 0.15) based on general financial intuition.  Negative `RE/TA` often indicates financial distress, while low or negative `EBIT/TA` suggests weak profitability.  These would need to be optimized using a real dataset.
* **Feature Selection:** The choice of `RE/TA` and `EBIT/TA` is also based on common financial analysis principles.  However, the best features and their importance would be determined by training a decision tree model on a real dataset.
* **Depth 2 Structure:** The `if/else` structure implements the depth-2 decision tree logic described in the previous responses.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean results of the comparisons at each inner node, as required.
* **Example Usage:**  The example demonstrates how to use the `predict` function with a sample feature dictionary.

To build a truly effective model, you would need to train a decision tree algorithm on a labeled dataset of company financials and bankruptcy outcomes. This would allow the algorithm to determine the optimal features, thresholds, and tree structure.  Using a library like `scikit-learn` makes this process straightforward.  Once trained, you could extract the learned rules to create a similar `predict` function, but with data-driven logic.
