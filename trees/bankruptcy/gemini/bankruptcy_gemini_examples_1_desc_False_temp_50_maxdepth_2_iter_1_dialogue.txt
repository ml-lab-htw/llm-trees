**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  Meaningful threshold values are added for `RE/TA` (10%) and `EBIT/TA` (5%). These are just examples, and in a real application, you would determine these through model training.  The values represent reasonable cutoffs based on general financial analysis principles, where low or negative values often suggest financial distress.

* **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly tracks the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.

* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure more clearly reflects the decision tree logic.

* **Example Usage:** Included examples demonstrating how to use the function and interpret the output.


This improved version provides a functional Python implementation of the bankruptcy prediction decision tree, including meaningful threshold values and a mechanism for tracking the logic flow.  Remember, real-world application requires training on actual financial data to determine the optimal thresholds and feature importance.
