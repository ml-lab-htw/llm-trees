**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** I've included specific numerical thresholds for the financial ratios, making the decision logic more concrete.
* **Node Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean truth values (True/False, represented as 1/0) of each decision node's condition.  This provides insight into the path taken through the tree for a given input.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The tree structure is slightly simplified compared to the initial example to avoid unnecessary nesting and improve readability. The core logic remains the same.
* **Consistent Key Usage:**  The code now strictly adheres to the specified feature keys (e.g., 'WC/TA', 'EBIT/TA').
* **Type Hinting:**  The function signature now includes type hints (`X: dict`) to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
* **Docstring:** A docstring has been added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.



This revised function provides a more complete and practical implementation of the bankruptcy prediction decision tree, including the essential node truth value tracking.  Remember, this is still a demonstration; a real-world model would be trained on data.  You would replace the example thresholds with those learned by the decision tree algorithm.
