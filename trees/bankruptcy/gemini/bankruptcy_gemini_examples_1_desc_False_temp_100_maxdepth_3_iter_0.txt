**Explanation and Justification:**

The generated decision tree uses a maximum depth of 3 and focuses on key financial ratios often associated with bankruptcy prediction:

1. **RE/TA (Retained Earnings / Total Assets):**  This ratio reflects the company's accumulated profits relative to its size.  Negative retained earnings are a strong signal of financial distress and often precede bankruptcy.  This is chosen as the root node because it's a fundamental measure of long-term financial health.

2. **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets):** This ratio measures the company's operating profitability.  Negative EBIT indicates that the company's core operations are not generating enough profit to cover expenses, which is a major risk factor for bankruptcy.

3. **WC/TA (Working Capital / Total Assets):**  This ratio measures the company's short-term liquidity.  Negative working capital can indicate difficulty meeting immediate obligations, potentially leading to bankruptcy.

The logic of the tree is as follows:

* **Root Node (RE/TA <= 0):** If a company has negative retained earnings, it's already in a precarious financial position, increasing the likelihood of bankruptcy.
* **Second Level (EBIT/TA <= 0):** If the company is also unprofitable (negative EBIT/TA), the risk of bankruptcy is further elevated.
* **Third Level (WC/TA <= 0):**  If, in addition to negative retained earnings and unprofitability, the company also has negative working capital (indicating poor short-term liquidity), then bankruptcy is highly probable.



This structure makes intuitive sense as it prioritizes long-term financial health (RE/TA), then checks profitability (EBIT/TA), and finally assesses short-term liquidity (WC/TA).  While this tree is generated without training data, it leverages common financial knowledge to create a reasonable bankruptcy prediction heuristic.  It is important to remember that this is a simplified model and actual bankruptcy prediction requires more sophisticated analysis.
