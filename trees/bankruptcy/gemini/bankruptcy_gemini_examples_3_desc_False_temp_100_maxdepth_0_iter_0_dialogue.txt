    """Predicts bankruptcy (0=no, 1=yes) based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of financial ratios with keys:
            'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
            'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
            'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
            'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
            'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt.
            nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1 if condition met, else 0).
    """

    nodes = 4 * [None] 

    # Example thresholds - you'll need to adjust these based on your data analysis!
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] < -0.1  # Poor earnings performance
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] < 0.1       # Low working capital
    nodes[2] = X['BVE/BVL'] < 1.2     # Low equity to debt ratio 
    nodes[3] = X['S/TA'] < 0.5       # Low sales generation 

    if nodes[0]:  # If EBIT/TA is negative (signaling potential financial distress)
        if nodes[1]: # If working capital is also low, higher chance of bankruptcy
            prediction = 1 
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Check for low equity compared to debt
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else: # If EBIT/TA is not signaling major distress
        if nodes[3]: # Check if sales are significantly low
            prediction = 1 
        else:
            prediction = 0 

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

* **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds are just examples. You **must** replace these with meaningful values based on analysis of your bankruptcy dataset. Techniques like looking at distributions, using domain knowledge, or even more advanced methods within the decision tree algorithm can help determine good splitting thresholds.
* **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` structure implements the decision tree logic. Each `nodes[i]` condition represents a decision node in the tree.
* **Truth Values (Nodes List):** The `nodes` list keeps track of which conditions were met for a given input `X`.  This can be helpful for understanding the path the decision tree took to reach its prediction.

**How to Use:**

```python
example_company = {
    'WC/TA': 0.05,
    'RE/TA': 0.2,
    'EBIT/TA': -0.15,
    'S/TA': 0.6,
    'BVE/BVL': 1.1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_company)

print(f"Prediction (0=No Bankruptcy, 1=Bankruptcy): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Feature Names:** Uses your provided financial ratio keys for clarity.
* **Bankruptcy-Specific Logic:** The decision tree structure now focuses on relationships between financial ratios that are relevant to bankruptcy prediction (though the thresholds need adjustment).
* **Clearer Comments:**  Explanations added to make the code and decision process easier to understand. 

**Remember:** This is a very simplified example. In reality, you'd want to:

* **Train and Evaluate:**  Use a decision tree algorithm with your data to find the best structure and thresholds automatically.
* **Consider More Features:** Explore additional financial and non-financial features that could improve prediction accuracy.
* **Explore More Advanced Models:**  Investigate ensemble methods (like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) as they often outperform single decision trees.
