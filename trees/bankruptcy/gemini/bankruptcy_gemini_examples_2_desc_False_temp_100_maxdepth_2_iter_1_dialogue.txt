**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've chosen reasonable threshold values based on general financial intuition (low EBIT/TA and BVE/BVL often indicate higher bankruptcy risk). However, the best thresholds should be determined using a training dataset and techniques like finding the optimal split points that maximize information gain or minimize Gini impurity.
* **Feature Importance:**  The choice of "EBIT/TA" and "BVE/BVL" as the top features is also a hypothetical example.  A real decision tree algorithm would determine feature importance automatically based on the training data.
* **Depth 2 Structure:** The `if/else` structure implements the decision tree logic with a depth of 2, as requested.  The `nodes` list stores the boolean results of the conditions at each node.
* **Example Usage:** The provided examples show how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.

To create a more robust and accurate decision tree, you'll need to provide a labeled dataset, and I can use scikit-learn (or a similar library) to train a decision tree classifier with optimal parameters. This will find the best features, thresholds, and tree structure for your specific data.
