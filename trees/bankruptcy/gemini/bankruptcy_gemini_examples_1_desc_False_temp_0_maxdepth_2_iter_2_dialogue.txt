Key improvements in this version:

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  `re_threshold` and `ebit_threshold` are now explicitly defined, making the decision logic more transparent.  Remember these are *hypothetical* and would be learned from training data.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.
* **Example Usage:** Included example usage to demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the output.
* **Consistent Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Target Encoding:**  Uses 0 and 1 for the target variable as specified.



This revised code is more robust, readable, and aligns more closely with best practices. It also now gives the truth values of the nodes, as requested. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values obtained from training a real decision tree model on real-world data.
