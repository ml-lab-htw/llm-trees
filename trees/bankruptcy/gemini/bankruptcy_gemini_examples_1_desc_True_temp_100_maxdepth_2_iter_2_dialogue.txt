def predict(X: dict):

    Predicts bankruptcy based on financial ratios.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the following features:
            - 'WC/TA': Working Capital/Total Assets
            - 'RE/TA': Retained Earnings/Total Assets
            - 'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets
            - 'S/TA': Sales/Total Assets
            - 'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean
               values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

This revised code includes:

* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  `threshold1` and `threshold2` are set to example values (0.05 and 1.0, respectively). These represent reasonable, albeit simplified, cutoffs for profitability and solvency.
* **Integer Node Values:** The `nodes` list is converted to integers (0 or 1) before being returned.
* **Example Usage:**  The code includes example usage to demonstrate how to call the function and interpret the results.
* **Clearer Comments:**  Comments explain the logic and the meaning of the thresholds.


This provides a complete and functional implementation of the decision tree as a Python function. Remember that the performance of this simplified model would depend heavily on the quality and representativeness of the data used to determine appropriate threshold values in a real-world application.
