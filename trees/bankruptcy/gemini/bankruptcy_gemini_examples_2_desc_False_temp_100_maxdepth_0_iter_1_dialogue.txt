def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None] 
    nodes[0] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.10  
    nodes[1] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.5  
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05 
    nodes[3] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.15

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely bankrupt - low working capital and low equity
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1 # Likely bankrupt - low working capital and low profitability 
            else:
                prediction = 0 # Possibly not bankrupt - low working capital but decent profitability
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Potentially bankrupt - low retained earnings despite okay working capital
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely not bankrupt - healthy working capital and retained earnings

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Function Structure:**  The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys are the feature names and values are the corresponding values for a single company.
* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. This allows you to trace the decision path.
* **Threshold Selection:** I've chosen some initial thresholds (e.g., 0.10 for 'WC/TA', 1.5 for 'BVE/BVL') based on general financial intuition. These would need to be adjusted and validated with real data and analysis.
* **Decision Logic:**  The `if-else` statements represent the decision tree's branches, leading to a final bankruptcy prediction (0 or 1).

**How to Use the Function:**

```python
company_data = {'WC/TA': 0.05, 'RE/TA': 0.2, 'EBIT/TA': 0.03, 'S/TA': 1.2, 'BVE/BVL': 0.8}
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)

print(f"Prediction: {"Bankrupt" if prediction == 1 else "Not Bankrupt"}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Important:**  This is a simplified illustrative example. The accuracy and reliability of the decision tree depend heavily on:

* **Data Quality:**  A large and representative dataset of companies with accurate financial data and bankruptcy labels is crucial.
* **Feature Engineering:**  You might need to create Features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.
* **Threshold Optimization:** The chosen thresholds significantly impact performance. Use techniques like cross-validation to find optimal values.
* **Model Evaluation:**  Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on a separate test dataset.
