def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree
    nodes[0] = X['RE/TA'] <= -0.1  # Using Retained Earnings/Total Assets with a threshold of -0.1. Negative retained earnings suggest potential financial distress.

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Predicted Bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Predicted Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
