**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with concrete values based on common interpretations of financial distress. These are still illustrative and would ideally be learned from data.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree is slightly simplified to focus on the most critical factors and avoid unnecessary branching based on `S/TA` which was a weaker indicator in the previous example.  This improves interpretability and reduces potential overfitting if we had limited training data.
* **Direct Mapping to Python:** The logic of the decision tree is directly translated into `if/else` statements for straightforward implementation.
* **Returns Truth Values:**  The function returns the `nodes` list containing boolean values representing the conditions at each node, as requested. This allows for inspection of the decision path.
* **Docstring:**  A docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.

**Example Usage:**

```python
company_data = {"WC/TA": -0.1, "RE/TA": -0.3, "EBIT/TA": -0.15, "S/TA": 0.7, "BVE/BVL": 0.3}
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Bankruptcy prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Bankruptcy prediction: 1
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Output: Node truth values: [True, True, True, True]


company_data2 = {"WC/TA": 0.1, "RE/TA": 0.2, "EBIT/TA": 0.15, "S/TA": 1.2, "BVE/BVL": 1.5}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(company_data2)
print(f"Bankruptcy prediction: {prediction2}") # Output: Bankruptcy prediction: 0
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes2}") # Output: Node truth values: [False, False, False, False]

```


This improved function provides a more practical and interpretable bankruptcy prediction model while adhering to the requested format and including illustrative thresholds.  Remember that real-world applications require training on actual data and likely more sophisticated models.
