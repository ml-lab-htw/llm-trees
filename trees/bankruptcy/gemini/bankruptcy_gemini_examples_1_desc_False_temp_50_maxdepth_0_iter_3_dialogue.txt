**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  The thresholds in the decision tree are now based on typical values that might indicate financial distress.  For example, a `WC/TA` ratio below 0.05 suggests potential liquidity problems.
* **Simplified Structure:** The decision tree logic is streamlined for better readability and efficiency.
* **Adherence to Feature Names:** The code uses the exact feature names provided (e.g., "WC/TA", "RE/TA").
* **Target Encoding:** The function returns 0 for "Non-Bankrupt" and 1 for "Bankrupt," matching the specified target encoding.
* **Docstrings:**  A docstring is included to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.


**Example Usage:**

```python
company_data = {"WC/TA": 0.02, "RE/TA": -0.15, "EBIT/TA": -0.08, "S/TA": 0.7, "BVE/BVL": 1.2}
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Bankrupt)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True, True, True]

company_data2 = {"WC/TA": 0.10, "RE/TA": 0.05, "EBIT/TA": 0.04, "S/TA": 1.2, "BVE/BVL": 2.0}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(company_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Non-Bankrupt)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, False, False, False]
```


This improved function provides a more robust and practical implementation of the bankruptcy prediction decision tree. Remember, a real-world model would need to be trained on real data to determine optimal thresholds and branching logic.
