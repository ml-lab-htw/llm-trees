def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.1  # Threshold1:  Working capital below 10% of assets is a bad sign
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.05 # Threshold2: Low retained earnings (5% of assets) suggests trouble

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Likely bankrupt if low working capital
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely bankrupt if low retained earnings even with decent working capital
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt if both are healthy

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`WC/TA <= 0.1`:** A working capital to total assets ratio below 0.1 (or 10%) suggests that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations.  This is a common indicator of financial distress.
* **`RE/TA <= 0.05`:**  Retained earnings represent the accumulated profits of a company.  A low ratio (e.g., 5% of total assets) could indicate a history of losses or insufficient profitability to withstand financial shocks, even if the company currently has adequate working capital.

**Important Notes:**

* **These thresholds are educated guesses.**  In a real-world scenario, these values would be learned from the data during the training of a decision tree model.  Different datasets and industries will likely have different optimal thresholds.
* **The choice of 0.1 and 0.05 is illustrative.** You can adjust these based on domain knowledge or analysis of your specific dataset.  Statistical analysis of the distributions of `WC/TA` and `RE/TA` for bankrupt vs. non-bankrupt companies would be very helpful in determining realistic thresholds.
* **Feature Importance:**  The decision tree structure implies that `WC/TA` is considered more important than `RE/TA`.  This is because it's the first split.  Again, a real decision tree algorithm would determine this order of importance based on the data.



This function now adheres to the format of the examples you provided.  It takes a dictionary of features as input (`X`), calculates the truth values of the inner nodes, and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values (`nodes`). Remember, to make this a truly effective model, you need to train it on real bankruptcy data.
