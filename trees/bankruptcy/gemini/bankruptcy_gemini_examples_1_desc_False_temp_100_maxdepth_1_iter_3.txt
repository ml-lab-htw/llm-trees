**Explanation of Feature Selection and Threshold:**

For a depth-1 decision tree with a binary classification target, we're essentially looking for a single feature and a threshold on that feature that best separates the two classes (bankrupt or not bankrupt).

In financial analysis, the `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) ratio is often a strong indicator of financial health.  Retained earnings represent the accumulated profits a company has reinvested in its business.  A negative or very low `RE/TA` can signal that a company has been losing money and depleting its resources, which significantly increases the risk of bankruptcy.

Therefore, a simple rule like "if `RE/TA` is less than or equal to 0.0, then predict bankruptcy (1), otherwise predict not bankrupt (0)" is a reasonable starting point for a depth-1 decision tree without any training data.  The threshold of 0.0 is chosen because negative retained earnings clearly indicate financial distress.



It's crucial to remember that this decision tree is created heuristically, based on general financial knowledge, and not trained on any specific data.  Its performance would need to be evaluated on real data, and a deeper tree or different features might be necessary for better accuracy.
