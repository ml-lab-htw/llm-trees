```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.0
    nodes[1] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the generated decision tree:**

The generated decision tree utilizes `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) and `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets) as the key features for predicting bankruptcy. This is based on the general financial intuition that companies with negative retained earnings and negative earnings before interest and taxes are at a higher risk of bankruptcy.

* **Node 0: `RE/TA <= 0.0`**: This checks if the company's retained earnings are negative relative to its total assets.  Negative retained earnings can indicate accumulated losses and financial distress.
* **Node 1: `EBIT/TA <= 0.0`**:  This checks if the company's earnings before interest and taxes are negative relative to its total assets. Negative EBIT signifies operational unprofitability.

The tree's logic is as follows:

1. **`RE/TA <= 0.0 and EBIT/TA <= 0.0`**: If both are true (negative retained earnings and negative operating earnings), the prediction is bankruptcy (1).  This signifies a company struggling both operationally and financially.
2. **`RE/TA <= 0.0 and EBIT/TA > 0.0`**: If retained earnings are negative but operating earnings are positive, the prediction is non-bankruptcy (0).  This suggests a company might be recovering or has temporary financial issues.
3. **`RE/TA > 0.0`**: If retained earnings are positive, regardless of EBIT/TA, the prediction is non-bankruptcy (0).  Positive retained earnings generally signal financial health.

This decision tree, while simple, captures a core financial principle relating to bankruptcy prediction.  It's important to note that real-world bankruptcy prediction models are significantly more complex and utilize many more factors. This example demonstrates the basic structure and logic of a decision tree with a limited depth and feature set.
