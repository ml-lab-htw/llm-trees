This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the predicted bankruptcy status (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the decision nodes. The thresholds used are based on the rationale explained in the previous response, representing plausible values for financial distress.  Remember, this is still a hypothetical tree; a real-world model would require data training.
