```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= -0.1  # Using -0.1 as a reasonable threshold for EBIT/TA indicating potential bankruptcy

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Predicted Bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Predicted Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```
