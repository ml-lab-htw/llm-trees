This function takes a dictionary `X` representing the feature values of a company and returns the predicted bankruptcy status (0 or 1) along with a list `nodes` containing the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree.  The thresholds used are based on the hypothetical tree from the previous response and are meant to be plausible, but they are not based on any real-world data analysis.  Remember to train a decision tree on real data to obtain a more reliable model.
