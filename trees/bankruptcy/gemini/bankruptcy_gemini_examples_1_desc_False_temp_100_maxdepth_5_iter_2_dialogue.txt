This Python function mirrors the structure of the hypothetical decision tree presented previously. It takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the predicted bankruptcy status (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.  The `nodes` list helps understand the path taken through the decision tree for a given input.  Remember, this is a hypothetical tree and its performance on real data is unknown.  A real-world application requires training on a dataset.
