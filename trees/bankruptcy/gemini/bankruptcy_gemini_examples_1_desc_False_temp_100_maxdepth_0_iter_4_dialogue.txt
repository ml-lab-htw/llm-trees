```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Thresholds based on financial ratios.  These are reasonable guesses
    # and would be learned from data in a real application.
    threshold1 = 0.1  # WC/TA threshold - Positive working capital is generally good
    threshold2 = 0.05 # RE/TA threshold - Positive retained earnings are generally good

    nodes[0] = X["WC/TA"] <= threshold1
    nodes[1] = X["RE/TA"] <= threshold2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low Working Capital
        prediction = 1  # Likely Bankrupt
    else: # Healthy Working Capital
        if nodes[1]: # Low Retained Earnings
            prediction = 1 # Potentially Bankrupt
        else: # Healthy Retained Earnings
            prediction = 0 # Likely Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Thresholds:**  The `threshold1` (0.1) and `threshold2` (0.05) are example values. In a real-world application, these would be determined by training the decision tree on a labeled dataset.  They represent the points where the tree makes decisions.
* **Feature Importance:** The tree uses `WC/TA` and `RE/TA` as the splitting features. Again, this is an assumption based on general financial principles.  In practice, feature importance would be learned from the training data.
* **Interpretability:** The function and the tree structure make it easy to understand the logic behind the predictions.
* **No Training:** This code creates the tree structure and the prediction function directly, *without any training*.  This is suitable for the problem specification but wouldn't produce a robust or accurate model in a real-world scenario.
* **Limited Depth:** The maximum depth of 2 limits the tree's complexity.  A deeper tree might capture more nuanced relationships in the data.


To use this function, you would pass a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a company:

```python
company_data = {"WC/TA": 0.05, "RE/TA": -0.1, "EBIT/TA": 0.02, "S/TA": 1.2, "BVE/BVL": 1.5}
prediction, nodes = predict(company_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```


This would output the bankruptcy prediction (0 or 1) and the truth values of the inner nodes.  Remember to train a real decision tree on relevant data for accurate predictions in a practical application.
