**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Thresholds:** Meaningful threshold values have been added for `EBIT/TA` and `BVE/BVL`. These are just examples, and in a real-world application, you would determine optimal thresholds using a training dataset and techniques like cross-validation.
* **Correct Feature Names:**  The code now uses the exact feature names provided (e.g., "EBIT/TA").
* **Clearer Logic:** The decision logic is explained in the comments, making it easier to understand the reasoning behind the predictions.
* **Target Encoding:** The function returns 0 for "Not Bankrupt" and 1 for "Bankrupt," matching the provided target encoding.
* **Example Usage:**  The code includes example usage to demonstrate how to use the `predict` function.
* **More Realistic Scenario Handling**: The logic now considers scenarios like a company with high profitability but also high debt (potentially leading to bankruptcy) and a company with low profitability but strong equity (potentially avoiding bankruptcy).


This improved version is more robust, clearer, and closer to a real-world implementation, although it still relies on example threshold values that should be learned from data in a proper machine learning setting.
