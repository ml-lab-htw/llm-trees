Key improvements:

* **Correct Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided (`'WC/TA'`, etc.).
* **Clearer Thresholds:**  Includes explicit thresholds within the conditions, making the logic easier to understand.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree's branches, improving readability.
* **Return Nodes:**  Returns the `nodes` list as requested, indicating the truth values of the conditions.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to use the function with sample data.
* **Adjusted Number of Nodes:** The number of nodes in the `nodes` list reflects the actual number of decision nodes in the tree.


This improved function accurately represents the decision tree logic and returns both the prediction and the node truth values, making it suitable for your requirements.  Remember that the thresholds and tree structure are still hypothetical.  You'll need to train a model on real data to obtain a robust bankruptcy prediction model.
