    nodes[1] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05  # Low profitability (5% or less) increases risk
    nodes[2] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0  # Liabilities exceeding equity is a strong indicator

    if nodes[0]:  # Low or negative retained earnings

            prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt (potentially risky, but might recover)
    else:  # Positive retained earnings
        if nodes[2]:  # Low solvency (BVE/BVL)
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt (despite positive RE/TA, solvency is critical)

            prediction = 0  # Non-Bankrupt

**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* **`RE/TA <= 0.0`**:  Negative retained earnings are a strong signal of accumulated losses and financial distress.
* **`EBIT/TA <= 0.05`**: A low EBIT/TA ratio (5% or less) indicates weak profitability, making it difficult to cover expenses and debt obligations.
* **`BVE/BVL <= 1.0`**: A ratio less than or equal to 1 means the book value of liabilities is equal to or greater than the book value of equity. This signifies low solvency and a higher risk of bankruptcy.

**Important Note:**  These thresholds are illustrative.  In a real-world application, you would determine these thresholds through training a decision tree model on a labeled dataset using a machine learning library like scikit-learn.  The optimal thresholds will depend heavily on the specific data you are working with.
