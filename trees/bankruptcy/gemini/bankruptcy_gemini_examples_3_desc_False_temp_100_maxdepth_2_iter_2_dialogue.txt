**Explanation and Justification:**

* **Feature Selection:** I've chosen `RE/TA` (Retained Earnings/Total Assets), `EBIT/TA` (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets), and `WC/TA` (Working Capital/Total Assets) as the key features for this illustrative example. These ratios are often good indicators of financial health.  Low retained earnings, low profitability (EBIT/TA), and low working capital can be signs of distress.
* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (0.10, 0.05, 0.00) are illustrative.  In a real-world scenario, these would be determined by analyzing the data and finding optimal splits using a decision tree algorithm.  These values represent reasonable guesses:
    * `RE/TA <= 0.10`: Companies with low retained earnings relative to total assets might be struggling.
    * `EBIT/TA <= 0.05`:  Low earnings before interest and tax could indicate unprofitability.
    * 'WC/TA <= 0.00': Negative working capital is a strong indicator of bankruptcy since a company essentially doesn't have enough liquid assets to cover its short term obligations. 
* **Tree Logic:** The nested `if` statements implement the decision tree logic. A company goes down a specific branch depending on whether the condition at each node is true or false.
* **Depth 2:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2, as required.


**Important Notes:**

* This is a simplified example. Real-world bankruptcy prediction requires more sophisticated models and thorough data analysis.
* The thresholds used here are examples and would need to be adjusted based on actual data.
* The choice of features is also illustrative. A proper feature selection process should be performed.  Feature engineering (creating Features from the existing ones) might also be beneficial.
* Consider using established machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn in Python) which provide efficient implementations of decision tree algorithms and handle tasks like feature selection, threshold optimization, and model evaluation automatically.  You'll need to provide the labeled dataset to the library.
