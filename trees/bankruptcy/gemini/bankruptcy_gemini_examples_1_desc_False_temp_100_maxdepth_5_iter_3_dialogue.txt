                prediction = 0 # Non-Bankrupt

Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided (`WC/TA`, `RE/TA`, etc.).
* **Threshold Values:** Includes reasonable placeholder threshold values.  These would be learned from data in a real-world application, but the values here are consistent with the logic discussed earlier.
* **Node Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values of the conditions at each inner node (1 if true, 0 if false).
* **Consistent Encoding:** Uses 0 for non-bankrupt and 1 for bankrupt, as specified.
* **Depth Control:** The tree structure respects the implicit maximum depth constraint by using nested `if/else` statements, effectively mirroring a decision tree's branching logic.


This function now provides both the prediction and the truth values for the inner nodes, making it suitable for interpreting the decision path.  Remember that this is still a demonstrative example.  For real-world use, you *must* train a decision tree on real data using a machine learning library.
