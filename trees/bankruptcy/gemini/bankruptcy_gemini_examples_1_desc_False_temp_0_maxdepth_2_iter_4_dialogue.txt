**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added placeholder thresholds (`ebit_ta_threshold` and `equity_liabilities_threshold`). In a real-world application, these values would be determined by training the decision tree on actual data using a suitable algorithm to find the optimal split points.
* **Feature Selection:** The tree uses `EBIT/TA` and `BVE/BVL`, as discussed before.  Again, the best features to use would be determined through data analysis.
* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list now correctly stores the boolean values (True/False) representing whether each condition is met.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure is now more aligned with the decision tree logic, making the code easier to understand.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.

This improved function is more robust and closer to a real-world implementation, although it still requires actual data for training to determine optimal thresholds and feature importance. Remember to carefully consider feature scaling and other preprocessing steps when working with real financial data.
