**Explanation:**

* **Function Structure:**  The code defines a function `predict(X)` that takes a dictionary `X` of financial ratios as input.
* **Decision Nodes:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of conditions at each decision node. The thresholds (e.g., 0.05, 1.2, 0.1) in the example are placeholders and **should be replaced with values learned from your data** during the decision tree training process. 
* **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree's logic.  
    * A company with low `EBIT/TA` (earnings before interest and tax to total assets) is considered more likely to go bankrupt.
    * If `EBIT/TA` is not low, then a low `BVE/BVL` (book value of equity to book value of liabilities) combined with low `WC/TA` (working capital to total assets) increases the likelihood of bankruptcy.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:**  To create a meaningful decision tree, you need a labeled dataset of companies with their financial ratios and bankruptcy status (0 or 1).
* **Decision Tree Learning:** You'll use a decision tree learning algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, CART) with your data to determine:
    * The best features (financial ratios) to split on at each node.
    * The optimal threshold values for each feature split.
* **Evaluation:** Once the tree is built, you'll evaluate its performance on unseen data to measure its accuracy in predicting bankruptcy.

This code provides the structure for your bankruptcy prediction function. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values learned from your data using a decision tree algorithm.
