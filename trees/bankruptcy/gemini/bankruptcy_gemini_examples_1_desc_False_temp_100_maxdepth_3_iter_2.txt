**Explanation and Justification:**

The generated decision tree uses a maximum depth of 3 and focuses on key financial ratios likely to be indicative of bankruptcy.

* **RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets):**  Retained earnings represent the accumulated profits of a company that haven't been distributed as dividends.  A low or negative RE/TA ratio often suggests financial distress, making it a good top-level split.
* **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets):** This ratio measures a company's profitability relative to its total assets.  Low or negative EBIT/TA can indicate an inability to generate sufficient profits, increasing the risk of bankruptcy. This is used as a second-level split after considering retained earnings.
* **WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets):** Working capital reflects a company's short-term liquidity.  A low or negative WC/TA can signal difficulty meeting short-term obligations, which can be a precursor to bankruptcy.  This is used as a third-level split, refining the prediction further.


This structure aims to capture a simplified decision process for bankruptcy prediction based on readily available financial information.  The choices of features and thresholds are heuristic and aren't based on trained data, as per the prompt's instructions. A real-world bankruptcy prediction model would require much more sophisticated analysis and training on a large dataset.
