def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts bankruptcy (0=No, 1=Yes) based on financial ratios.

    This tree is HYPOTHETICAL due to lack of training data.
    Please replace thresholds with values learned from YOUR dataset.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of financial ratios:
            'WC/TA': Working Capital / Total Assets
            'RE/TA': Retained Earnings / Total Assets
            'EBIT/TA': Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
            'S/TA': Sales / Total Assets
            'BVE/BVL': Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt
            nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1 if condition met, else 0)
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None] # Adjust size based on your tree depth

    # Example thresholds - REPLACE THESE with meaningful values:
    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= -0.10  # High losses
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= 0.05   # Low working capital
    nodes[2] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0  # Low equity compared to debt

    if nodes[0]:  # Major losses
        prediction = 1  # Likely bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Low working capital
            if nodes[2]: # High debt burden
                prediction = 1 # Likely bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0 # May recover

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** We create the `nodes` list, its size depending on how many decisions your tree makes. Each element will store True/False based on whether that node's condition is met.

2. **Thresholds:**  The provided values for `EBIT/TA`, `WC/TA`, `BVE/BVL` are placeholders. **You MUST replace these** based on what values actually distinguish bankrupt companies in your data.

3. **Decision Logic:**  This follows the structure you've requested, using nested `if` statements to traverse the tree.  Each `nodes[i]` acts like traversing a branch (True = condition met, go down that path).

4. **Prediction:** At each leaf node (end of a branch), we set `prediction` to either 0 or 1.

**Important:**

- This code assumes your tree has the structure outlined in the comments. You'll likely have more nodes and different thresholds once you train on real data.
- Without the actual dataset and your chosen decision tree algorithm, this function can't be made more precise.
- Use this as a template, replacing the placeholders and potentially adding more branches/conditions to match the output of your trained decision tree model.
