This Python function mirrors the structure of the hypothetical decision tree described previously. It takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the predicted bankruptcy status (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember, this is still a simplified example and a real-world application would require training on a dataset.  The thresholds used are for illustrative purposes.
