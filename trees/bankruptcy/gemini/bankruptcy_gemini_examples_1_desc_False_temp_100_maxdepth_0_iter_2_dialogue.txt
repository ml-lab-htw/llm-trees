```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.05  # Node 1: Check if EBIT/TA is low
    nodes[1] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 1.0 # Node 2: Check if BVE/BVL is low (if EBIT/TA > 0.05)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt if EBIT/TA is low
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt if BVE/BVL is low (and EBIT/TA is not low)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt otherwise


    return prediction, nodes


```


This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the predicted bankruptcy status (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the inner nodes. The thresholds (0.05 for `EBIT/TA` and 1.0 for `BVE/BVL`) are incorporated directly into the conditions within the function, reflecting the hypothetical decision tree structure discussed earlier.  Remember, these thresholds are illustrative and would be learned from data in a real-world scenario.
