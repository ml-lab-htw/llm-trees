This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input.  It then evaluates the conditions of the decision tree, storing the truth values (True/False, represented as 1/0) in the `nodes` list. Finally, it returns the predicted class (0 for non-bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt) and the `nodes` list.  The thresholds used in the conditions are based on the hypothetical tree from the previous response.  Remember that these thresholds and the tree structure itself are illustrative and would need to be learned from real data in a practical application.
