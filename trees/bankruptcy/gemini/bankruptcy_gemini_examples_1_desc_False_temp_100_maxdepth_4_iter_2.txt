**Explanation and Justification of the Generated Tree:**

The generated decision tree uses a series of nested `if` statements based on thresholds for the provided financial ratios. These thresholds are chosen somewhat arbitrarily, as we are not training on actual data. However, the choices reflect general intuition about how these ratios might relate to bankruptcy risk.

* **RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets):**  Negative retained earnings often signal financial distress.  The tree uses this as a primary splitting point.
* **EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets):**  Low or negative EBIT/TA indicates profitability problems, another key indicator of bankruptcy risk.
* **WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets):** Low working capital can suggest liquidity issues, which make it difficult for a company to meet its short-term obligations.
* **S/TA (Sales/Total Assets):** Low sales efficiency could contribute to financial difficulties.
* **BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities):**  A low BVE/BVL suggests a higher level of debt relative to equity, increasing financial leverage and risk.

The nested structure of the `if` statements simulates the branches of a decision tree. Each `if` statement checks a condition related to a feature. The depth of the nesting (the maximum number of nested `if` statements) reflects the maximum depth of the tree.  The `prediction` variable is assigned a value (0 or 1 representing bankruptcy prediction) based on the path through the tree.


The conditions and thresholds in this example are illustrative. With real data, a machine learning algorithm would learn these conditions and thresholds to maximize predictive accuracy.  This code fulfills the prompt's requirements by creating a decision tree function with specified features, a maximum depth, and returning the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes without being trained on actual data.  It uses more than 4 nodes (up to 15 was allowed) to illustrate a more complex tree structure within the depth constraint.
