Based on the provided features and target encoding, here's the decision tree function for bankruptcy prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.30

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.10
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > -0.05
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.30
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.30
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of each decision node
3. Evaluates each node condition using meaningful thresholds based on financial ratios
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are set based on common financial benchmarks:
- RE/TA: -0.05 (negative retained earnings is a warning sign)
- WC/TA: 0.10 (healthy companies typically maintain positive working capital)
- EBIT/TA: 0.02 (positive operating profit margin)
- BVE/BV
