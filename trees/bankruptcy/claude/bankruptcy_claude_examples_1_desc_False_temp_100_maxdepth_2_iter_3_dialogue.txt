Based on the provided feature names and the bankruptcy prediction context, I'll create a decision function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature names and the correct target encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.25
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the financial ratios as input
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of each decision node
3. Implements the same tree structure as before, but with:
   - Proper feature names ("RE/TA" and "WC/TA")
   - Correct encoding (0 for non-bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt)
   - Reasonable threshold values based on financial ratios
4. Returns both the prediction and the nodes list

The thresholds (-0.25 and -0.10) are realistic values for these financial ratios in the context of bankruptcy prediction.
