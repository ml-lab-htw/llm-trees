Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the given instructions, here's the Python function that predicts whether a company went bankrupt or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.75
    nodes[4] = X["S/TA"] <= 0.80

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the financial ratios as input. It then evaluates the conditions for each node in the decision tree and returns two things:

1. A prediction: 1 for bankrupt, 0 for not bankrupt.
2. A list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the inner nodes was satisfied (1) or not (0).

The thresholds used in this function are based on typical values for these financial ratios:

- RE/TA (Retained Earnings / Total Assets): 0.05 is a low value, indicating that the company has retained very little of its earnings.
- WC/TA (Working Capital / Total Assets): -0.10 indicates negative working capital, which is a sign of financial distress.
- EBIT/TA (Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets): 0.02 is a low profitability ratio.
- BVE/BVL (Book Value of Equity / Book Value of Liabilities):
