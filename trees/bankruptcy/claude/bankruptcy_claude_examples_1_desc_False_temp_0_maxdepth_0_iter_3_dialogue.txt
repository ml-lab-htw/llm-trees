Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts bankruptcy (1) or non-bankruptcy (0) and returns the node conditions. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on financial ratios:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.30
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.10
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > -0.05
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.30
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.30
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if retained earnings to total assets ratio is very negative (≤ -0.05)
2. If true, then checks working capital ratio (≤ 0.10)
3. If RE/TA is better but WC/TA is poor, checks operating efficiency (EBIT/TA ≤ 0.02)
4. For companies with better retained earnings, checks the equity to debt ratio (BVE/BVL ≤ 0.30)

The function returns
