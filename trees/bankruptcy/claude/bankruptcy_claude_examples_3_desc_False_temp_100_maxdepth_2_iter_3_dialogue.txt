Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the bankruptcy prediction decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.15
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
          
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:

1. Takes a dictionary X containing the financial ratios as input
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Uses two key financial ratios:
   - RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) with threshold -0.15
   - WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets) with threshold -0.10
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for bankruptcy, 0 for non-bankruptcy
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds are chosen based on financial literature where:
- RE/TA <= -0.15 indicates significant accumulated losses
- WC/TA <= -0.10 indicates serious liquidity problems

The tree first checks the company's profitability history (RE/TA), and if that's poor, it then looks at the current liquidity position (WC/TA) to make the final prediction.
