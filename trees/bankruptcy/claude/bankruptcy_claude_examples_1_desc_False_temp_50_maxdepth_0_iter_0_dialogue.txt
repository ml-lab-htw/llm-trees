Based on the provided features and target encoding, here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.30

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.10
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > -0.05
        if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.30
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.30
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys as provided
2. Returns predictions encoded as 0 (not bankrupt) and 1 (bankrupt)
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node
4. Uses realistic thresholds based on financial ratios:
   - RE/TA: -0.05 (negative retained earnings often indicate financial distress)
   - WC/TA: 0.10 (low working capital ratio suggests liquidity problems)
   - EBIT/TA: 0.02 (low profitability is a warning sign)
   - BVE/BVL: 0.30 (low equity to debt
