Based on the provided feature names and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the bankruptcy classification decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.15
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.15
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= -0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > -0.10
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > -0.15
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Uses realistic threshold values for financial ratios
- Returns both the prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt) and the list of boolean values for each decision node
- Uses only the provided feature names with exact spelling
- Has a maximum depth of 4
- Focuses on the most important financial ratios for bankruptcy prediction

The thresholds are set to realistic values:
- RE/TA: -0.15 (negative retained earnings often indicate financial distress)
- WC/TA: -0.10 (negative working capital ratio indicates liquidity problems)
- EBIT/TA: 0.02 (low operating profitability is a warning sign)
