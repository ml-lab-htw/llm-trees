Based on the provided features and target encoding, here's the Python function for the bankruptcy prediction decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= 0.10
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.05
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > 0.10
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the financial ratios as input
2. Uses three key thresholds:
   - RE/TA: 0.10 (profitability threshold)
   - WC/TA: 0.05 (liquidity threshold)
   - EBIT/TA: 0.02 (operating efficiency threshold)
3. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (not bankrupt) or 1 (bankrupt)
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The thresholds are based on typical financial benchmarks where:
- RE/TA below 0.10 indicates concerning levels of accumulated losses
- WC/TA below 0.05 indicates severe liquidity problems
- EBIT/TA below 0.02 indicates very poor operating performance

The prediction follows the logic outlined in the previous decision tree structure, but now formatted as a proper Python function with explicit
