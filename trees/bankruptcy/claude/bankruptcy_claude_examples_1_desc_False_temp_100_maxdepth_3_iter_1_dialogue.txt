Based on the provided features and the bankruptcy classification task (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt), I'll create a prediction function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and sensible threshold values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.13
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.08
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= 0.13
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.08
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.08
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > 0.13
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.05
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds were chosen based on typical financial ratios where:
- RE/TA threshold of 0.13 indicates whether a company has been profitable historically
- WC/TA threshold of 0.08 indicates minimal acceptable liquidity
- EBIT/TA threshold of 0.05 indicates minimal acceptable operational profitability

The function takes a dictionary with the feature values and returns:
1. A prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt)
2. A list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
