Here's the Python function implementing the bankruptcy prediction decision tree using the exact feature names and encoding you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.13
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.03
    
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= 0.13
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.05
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.03
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.03
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > 0.13
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Returns both the prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt) and the list of node conditions
3. Uses reasonable threshold values based on financial ratios
4. Focuses on the most important features for bankruptcy prediction
5. Returns the node conditions as a list of boolean values

The thresholds chosen (0.13, 0.05, 0.03) are realistic values for these financial ratios and are based on common financial analysis benchmarks.
