Based on the provided feature names and typical financial ratios for bankruptcy prediction, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.25
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.05

    if nodes[0]:  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets <= -0.25
        if nodes[1]:  # Working Capital/Total Assets <= -0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # Retained Earnings/Total Assets > -0.25
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/Total Assets <= 0.05
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) is very negative (â‰¤ -0.25)
2. For companies with poor RE/TA, it then looks at WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets)
3. For companies with better RE/TA, it examines EBIT/TA (operating profitability)

The thresholds are chosen based on typical financial ratios where:
- RE/TA <= -0.25 indicates significant accumulated losses
- WC/TA <= -0.10 indicates serious liquidity problems
- EBIT/TA <= 0.05 indicates poor operating performance

The function returns:
1. A prediction (0 for non-bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt)
2. A list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition in the tree
