Based on the provided feature names and the bankruptcy prediction context, I'll create a decision function that implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, with realistic threshold values for financial ratios:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.04  # Low retained earnings relative to assets
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.05  # Negative working capital
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.01  # Low operating profitability
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low retained earnings
        if nodes[1]:  # Negative working capital
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # Positive working capital
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
    else:  # Higher retained earnings
        if nodes[2]:  # Low operating profitability
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # Better operating profitability
            prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds are chosen based on common financial analysis:
- RE/TA <= 0.04: Very low retained earnings relative to assets suggests historical unprofitability
- WC/TA <= -0.05: Negative working capital indicates liquidity problems
- EBIT/TA <= 0.01: Very low operating profit margin indicates operational inefficiency

The function returns:
- prediction: 0 for non-bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt
- nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met in the decision tree
