Based on the provided feature names and the task of bankruptcy prediction, I'll create a decision tree function with one split using RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) as the most important feature. The threshold of 0.13 is a reasonable value for this ratio:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node since depth is 1
    nodes[0] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.13
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If RE/TA <= 0.13
        prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
    else:  # If RE/TA > 0.13
        prediction = 0  # Not bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the features
- Creates a list for storing the node conditions
- Uses RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) as the splitting feature
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction (1 for bankrupt, 0 for not bankrupt)
  - list of node conditions (True/False values)
- Uses a threshold of 0.13 which is reasonable because:
  - RE/TA below 0.13 indicates low retained earnings relative to assets
  - This suggests either a young company or one that has been losing money
  - Both scenarios increase bankruptcy risk
