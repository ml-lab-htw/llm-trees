Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a Python function that implements the bankruptcy prediction decision tree using the exact feature keys and returns both the prediction and node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.15
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.15
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= -0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys as provided: "RE/TA" and "WC/TA"
2. Uses realistic threshold values based on financial ratios
3. Returns 0 for non-bankrupt and 1 for bankrupt companies
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
5. Uses the same structure as the decision tree I described earlier

The thresholds (-0.15 for RE/TA and -0.10 for WC/TA) are realistic values that indicate significant financial distress when companies have negative retained earnings and working capital relative to their total assets.
