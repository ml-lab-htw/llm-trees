Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the most important financial ratios to predict bankruptcy (1) or non-bankruptcy (0).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.15
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.08
    
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= 0.15
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.08
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.08
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > 0.15
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
- The function takes a dictionary X containing the financial ratios as input
- The primary split is on RE/TA (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) with a threshold of 0.15
- For companies with low retained earnings (≤0.15), a secondary split on WC/TA (Working Capital/Total Assets) with a threshold of 0.08 is used
- The thresholds were chosen based on typical financial ratios where:
  * RE/TA ≤ 0.15 indicates relatively low accumulated profits
  * WC/TA ≤ 0.08 indicates very low working capital buffer
- The function returns both the prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- The nodes list contains True/False values indicating whether each condition was met
