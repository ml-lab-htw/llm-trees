Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and appropriate thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.15
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.08
    
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= 0.15
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.08
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.08
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > 0.15
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature keys as provided: "RE/TA" and "WC/TA"
- Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt)
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on financial ratio analysis:
  - 0.15 for RE/TA (indicates whether a company has accumulated profits over time)
  - 0.08 for WC/TA (indicates short-term liquidity position)
- Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- Has a maximum depth of 2 as requested
- Uses the two most important features for bankruptcy prediction

The function takes a dictionary X containing the feature values and returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt)
2. A list of boolean values representing whether each condition was met
