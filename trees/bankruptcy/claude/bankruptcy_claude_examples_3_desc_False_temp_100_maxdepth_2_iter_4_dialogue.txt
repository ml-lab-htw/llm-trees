Based on the decision tree I created earlier, I'll format it as a Python function following your examples. I'll use realistic threshold values for financial ratios:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= 0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= -0.10
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the financial ratios as input
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First checks if Retained Earnings/Total Assets is <= 0.05
   - For companies with low retained earnings, checks if Working Capital/Total Assets is <= -0.10
4. Returns:
   - A prediction (1 for bankrupt, 0 for not bankrupt)
   - The list of boolean values for each decision node

The thresholds are chosen based on typical financial ratio values where:
- RE/TA <= 0.05 indicates very low or negative retained earnings
- WC/TA <= -0.10 indicates significant liquidity problems
