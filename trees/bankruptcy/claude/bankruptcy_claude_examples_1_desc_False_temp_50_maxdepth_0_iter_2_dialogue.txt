I'll create a Python function that implements the bankruptcy prediction decision tree with the exact feature names you provided. The function will return both the prediction (0 for non-bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt) and the list of boolean values for each decision node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.01
    nodes[3] = X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.30
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.10
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.01
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.01
                prediction = 0  # Non-bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > -0.05
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.01
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.01
            if nodes[3]:  # BVE/BVL <= 0.30
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # BVE/BVL > 0.30
                prediction = 0  # Non-bankrupt
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Returns 0 for non-bankrupt companies and 1 for bankrupt companies
3. Uses meaningful thresholds based on financial ratios
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of boolean values for each decision node

The thresholds chosen are based on
