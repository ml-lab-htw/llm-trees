Based on the provided features and target encoding, here's the decision tree function for bankruptcy prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["RE/TA"] <= -0.05
    nodes[1] = X["WC/TA"] <= 0.10
    nodes[2] = X["EBIT/TA"] <= 0.02
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # RE/TA <= -0.05
        if nodes[1]:  # WC/TA <= 0.10
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:  # WC/TA > 0.10
            if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:  # RE/TA > -0.05
        if nodes[2]:  # EBIT/TA <= 0.02
            if X["BVE/BVL"] <= 0.50:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:  # EBIT/TA > 0.02
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses three main decision nodes based on RE/TA, WC/TA, and EBIT/TA
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = not bankrupt, 1 = bankrupt) and the list of boolean values for the three main decision nodes
4. Uses meaningful thresholds based on financial literature:
   - RE/TA threshold of -0.05 indicates significant accumulated losses
   - WC/TA threshold of 0.10 indicates minimal working capital
   - EBIT/
