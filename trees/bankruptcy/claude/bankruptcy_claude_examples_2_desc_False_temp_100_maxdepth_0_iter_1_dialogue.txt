Based on the decision tree I previously described and the specific requirements you've provided, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting company bankruptcy:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['RE/TA'] <= 0.0
    nodes[1] = X['WC/TA'] <= -0.1
    nodes[2] = X['EBIT/TA'] <= 0.01
    nodes[3] = X['BVE/BVL'] <= 0.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Bankrupt
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Bankrupt

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the financial ratios, and returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for not bankrupt, 1 for bankrupt) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features and thresholds:

1. Retained Earnings/Total Assets (RE/TA) <= 0.0
2. Working Capital/Total Assets (WC/TA) <= -0.1
3. Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Total Assets (EBIT/TA) <= 0.01
4. Book Value of Equity/Book Value of Liabilities (BVE/BVL) <= 0.5

These thresholds are based on typical values that might indicate financial distress, but they should be adjusted based on specific industry standards and historical data if available.

The function first evaluates each condition and stores the results in the `nodes` list. Then it traverses the decision tree based on these conditions to arrive at a final prediction.

Note that this is a simplifie
