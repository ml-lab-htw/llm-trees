    # Using 'physician fee freeze' and 'aid to nicaraguan contras' as key votes
    # Based on common political positions, these seem likely to be differentiating
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2  # Voted yes on budget resolution
    nodes[3] = X['mx missile'] == 2 # Voted yes on MX missile


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze (often a Republican position)
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras (often a Republican position)

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Selection:** I've chosen `physician fee freeze`, `aid to nicaraguan contras`, `adoption of the budget resolution`, and `mx missile` as the initial splitting features.  These are politically charged issues that often distinguish Republicans from Democrats.  However, *the optimal features will depend on the actual dataset*.  In a real application, you'd use feature importance from a trained decision tree model to guide these choices.
* **Thresholds:**  Since the votes are encoded as 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no," the thresholds are straightforward.
* **Tree Structure:** The example tree structure is simplified but demonstrates the logic.  A real-world tree might be much deeper and more complex.
* **Missing Values:** This function assumes no missing values. In real data, you'd need to handle missing votes using imputation or other strategies.
* **Overfitting:** This simple tree is likely to overfit real-world data.  Pruning or limiting the tree depth would be necessary when using a real dataset.



**How to use this with data:**

```python
# Example usage (replace with your actual data):
example_data = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_data)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}") # 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") 
```

Remember to train a real decision tree classifier on your actual data to get a more accurate and robust model! This example provides the structure of the prediction function, but the actual tree logic should be learned from the data.
