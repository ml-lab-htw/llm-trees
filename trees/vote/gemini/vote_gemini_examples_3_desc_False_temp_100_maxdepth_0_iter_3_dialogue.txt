```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 1  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 1 # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat (more likely if against contras)
    else:  # Voted No on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0 # Democrat (highly likely)
    
    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]


```

**Explanation and Rationale:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I've chosen "physician fee freeze" and "aid to Nicaraguan contras" based on the common knowledge that these were often partisan issues in the era this dataset likely comes from (e.g., the 1980s).  "Physician fee freeze" was generally supported by Democrats and opposed by Republicans. "Aid to Nicaraguan contras" was generally supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats. These aren't guaranteed predictors, but they are reasonable starting points without analyzing a specific dataset.

2. **Thresholds:** Since the feature encoding is 1 for "no" and 2 for "yes," I check `== 1` to see if the vote was "yes".

3. **Tree Structure:** The tree reflects the assumed relationships between these votes and party affiliation.  A "yes" vote on both issues strongly suggests Republican.  A "no" vote on the physician fee freeze highly suggests Democrat.

4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list records the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at each decision node. This allows for interpretability and debugging.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Dependence:**  This decision tree is a hypothetical example.  The actual most important features and the optimal tree structure depend heavily on the specific dataset you are using.  You should use feature selection techniques (e.g., information gain) on your data to determine the best features.
* **Overfitting:**  Simple trees like this can easily overfit to the training data.  With more features and data, a more complex tree might be needed, but be careful to avoid overfitting.  Techniques like pruning or setting a maximum depth can help.
* **Evaluation:**  Always evaluate the performance of your decision tree on a separate test set to get a realistic estimate of its generalization ability.


To improve this model, you would need to provide the actual voting data so that I can analyze it and build a more data-driven decision tree.  Libraries like scikit-learn in Python provide tools for training and evaluating decision tree classifiers.
