You got it! Here's the Python function representing a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting party affiliation, along with explanations:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of voting records, with keys as feature names 
                   and values as 1 (yes) or 2 (no).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat.
            nodes (list): Truth values (1 or 0) for each inner node condition.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize placeholders for our 2-depth tree
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # Hypothetical: Voting against contras 
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2         # Hypothetical: Voting against education spending

    if nodes[0]:  # Against aiding contras
        if nodes[1]: # Against education spending
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat
        else:            # For education spending
            prediction = 1  # Could be either party
    else:             # For aiding contras
        prediction = 1   # Likely Republican 

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
voting_record = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    # ... other voting records ...
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2, 
    'education spending': 1, 
    # ... other voting records ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_record)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1: Republican, 0: Democrat)")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:**  The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` representing an individual's voting record. It returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list `nodes` indicating which branches of the tree were taken.

2. **Hypothetical Tree:**  As you haven't provided a dataset to determine the actual most important features and thresholds, I've used the hypothetical example from my previous response:
   * **Root Node:** `nodes[0]` checks if the individual voted "no" (2) on aid to Nicaraguan contras.
   * **Second Level Node:** `nodes[1]` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is True) checks if the individual voted "no" (2) on education spending.

3. **Predictions:** The `if/else` logic implements the decision tree's branches to arrive at a prediction.

4. **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list is important for understanding the decision path. A value of 1 means the corresponding node's condition was True, and 0 means it was False.

**Important:**

* **Placeholders:** The feature choices and thresholds in this example are placeholders! To create a meaningful decision tree, you **must** provide a dataset so I can determine the most informative features and appropriate splitting points.
* **Depth Limitation:** The current tree has a maximum depth of 2, which may oversimplify the relationship between voting records and party affiliation.

**Next Steps:** 
1. **Provide a Dataset:** With a labeled dataset, I can use decision tree algorithms to determine the most important features and build a more accurate classifier.
2. **Refine the Tree:** We can then experiment with different tree depths and feature combinations to improve the model's performance.
