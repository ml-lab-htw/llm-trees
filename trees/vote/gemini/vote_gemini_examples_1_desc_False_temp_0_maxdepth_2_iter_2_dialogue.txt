```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Using physician fee freeze as first split
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2 # Using aid to Nicaraguan contras as second split


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Meaningful Splits:**  I've replaced the placeholder features with "physician fee freeze" and "aid to nicaraguan contras" for the first and second splits, respectively, as in my earlier hypothetical example.  These are just examples; *real* decision tree training would determine the most informative features.

2. **Encoding Handling:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that "yes" votes are encoded as `2` and "no" votes as `1`. The code now correctly uses `== 2` to check for "yes" votes.

3. **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure now directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.

4. **Return Format:**  The function returns the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the `nodes` list, where each element indicates whether the corresponding node's condition was met (1 for True, 0 for False, matching your specified format).


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1, # No
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [1, 0]
```


To build a true decision tree classifier, you need to use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) with real data. The library will handle feature selection, splitting criteria, and tree construction automatically. This code provides the structure of a depth-2 decision tree function, but it doesn't perform any learning from data.
