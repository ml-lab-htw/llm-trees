```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # 2 represents "yes"
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # 2 represents "yes"

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat if voted yes on physician fee freeze
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat if voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes



```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that "yes" is encoded as 2 and "no" as 1. The code now correctly uses these values.

2. **Target Encoding:** The target is 1 for Republican and 0 for Democrat. The code's logic reflects this.

3. **Clearer Node Conditions:** The conditions in the `if` statements now directly use the encoded values (2 for "yes") for better readability.

4. **List of Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list accurately stores the boolean results of each node's condition (1 if true, implicitly 0 if false due to the initial initialization).


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False] (or [0, 0] depending on Python version)
```


This improved version provides a clearer, more accurate, and more functional implementation of the decision tree logic based on the given specifications.  Remember, this is still a simplified example and requires real-world data and training for accurate political affiliation prediction.
