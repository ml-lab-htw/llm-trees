    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Two inner nodes in our depth-3 tree

    # Note: Using 2 for 'yes' and 1 for 'no', as per provided encoding.
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Physician Fee Freeze (yes=2 / no=1)
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2 # Aid to Nicaraguan Contras (yes=2 / no=1)

            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Contras Aid == No
            prediction = 1 # Republican (less certain, but still likely)
    else: # Physician Fee Freeze == No
        if X['education spending'] == 2: # Education Spending High (yes=2 / no=1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else: # Education Spending Low
            prediction = 0  # Democrat (less certain)

    return prediction, truth_values

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Encoding:** The code now explicitly uses the correct encoding (2 for 'yes', 1 for 'no') for the vote features.
* **Truth Values:** The `truth_values` list is now created, storing 1 if the condition at a node is true and 0 if it's false.
* **Simplified Conditions:**  The conditions in the `if` statements are simplified to directly check the encoded vote values.
* **Example Usage:** Added an `example_data` dictionary and a demonstration of how to call the `predict` function and interpret the results.

This revised code directly addresses the prompt's requirements for a Python function that returns both a prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree. Remember, this example still uses hypothetical relationships. A real-world application would learn these relationships from data.
