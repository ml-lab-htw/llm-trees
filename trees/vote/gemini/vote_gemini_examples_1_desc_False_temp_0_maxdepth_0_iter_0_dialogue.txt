**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Input Processing:** The function now preprocesses the input `X` to convert the vote values (2 for yes, 1 for no) to boolean-like values (1 for yes, 0 for no). This simplifies the conditions in the decision tree.

2. **Clearer Conditions:** The conditions in the `if/else` structure directly use the preprocessed vote values, making the logic easier to follow.

3. **Reduced Tree Depth:** The tree depth has been reduced based on the initial simplified example. This helps prevent overfitting, especially given the limited information we have without a real dataset.

4. **No Thresholds Needed:**  Because we're using binary vote data, we don't need thresholds in this specific case. The splits are based on whether a vote was "yes" or "no".

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list is populated with the truth values of the conditions at each node, as required.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}


prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted Party: {prediction}") # 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
print(f"Node Conditions: {nodes}")  # Truth values of the inner node conditions.
```



This improved version is more robust, easier to understand, and fulfills the requirements of returning both the prediction and the `nodes` list. Remember, this is still a simplified example.  A real-world model would be trained on data and might have a different structure and use different features.
