Since I don't have training data, I'll create a *hypothetical* decision tree based on common political stances.  Remember, a real decision tree would be derived from actual data. This example is for illustrative purposes only.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Hypothetical Decision Tree based on assumed political positions
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X['education spending'] == 2 # Voted yes on education spending
    nodes[3] = X['mx missile'] == 2 # Voted yes on mx missile


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes to physician fee freeze (assumed Republican leaning)
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes to aid to Nicaraguan contras (stronger Republican leaning)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else: # Voted no to aid to Nicaraguan contras (could be a moderate Republican)
            if nodes[3]: # voted yes to mx missile
                prediction = 1 # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0 #Democrat
    else:  # Voted no to physician fee freeze (assumed Democrat leaning)
        if nodes[2]:  # Voted yes to education spending (stronger Democrat leaning)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else: # Voted no to education spending (Could be moderate Democrat/Republican)
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1 # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0 # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes


# Example Usage (replace with your actual feature data)
example_data = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")



```


**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Tree:** The decision tree logic is entirely hypothetical and based on general assumptions about these political issues. *You MUST train a decision tree on real data to get a meaningful model.*
* **Feature Importance:** I've chosen 'physician fee freeze', 'aid to Nicaraguan contras', 'education spending', and 'mx missile' as the splitting features in this *example*. In a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined by the decision tree learning algorithm based on the training data.
* **Thresholds:** The thresholds here are based on the yes/no votes (1/2).
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which are implicitly converted to 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node. This provides insights into the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.
* **Real-World Application:**  To build an accurate model, you *must* provide labeled training data (legislator votes and their corresponding party affiliations).  Use a library like scikit-learn (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) to train the model.  Then you can convert the trained model's structure into a function similar to the one above.



This improved example provides a more plausible (though still hypothetical) decision tree and demonstrates the desired function format.  Remember to replace this hypothetical example with a tree trained on real data for accurate predictions.
