```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2 # Aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2  # Education Spending: yes


    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions specify that "2" represents "yes" and "1" represents "no" for the vote features. The code reflects this encoding.

2. **Clearer Conditions:**  The conditions now explicitly check for the "yes" vote (represented by 2) using `== 2`.

3. **Consistent Return:** The function returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

4. **Hypothetical Thresholds:**  Since we don't have real training data, the tree structure and feature choices remain hypothetical.  In a real-world scenario, these would be learned from the data.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}") # Output: 0 (Democrat - because voted 'no' on aid to contras)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Output: [True, False, True]
```


This improved function accurately implements the hypothetical decision tree logic and provides a clear and usable interface. Remember, the effectiveness of this tree depends entirely on the quality and representativeness of the training data used to create a real-world model. Using a machine learning library with real data is essential for building a robust and accurate classifier.
