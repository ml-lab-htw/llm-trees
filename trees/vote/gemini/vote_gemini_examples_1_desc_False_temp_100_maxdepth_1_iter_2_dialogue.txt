```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    #  "aid to nicaraguan contras" chosen as illustrative example (replace with actual best feature)
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1.5  # Threshold 1.5 means "no" (1) or abstain

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat (Illustrative - based on assumed dataset analysis)
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Republican (Illustrative)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder Replacement:** I've filled the placeholder with "aid to nicaraguan contras" and a threshold of 1.5. This is just an example.  To build a *real* model, you would need to:

   * **Obtain a labeled dataset:** A dataset with the votes and corresponding party affiliations is crucial.
   * **Perform feature selection:**  Calculate information gain or Gini impurity for each feature using the dataset to determine the *actual* most important feature.
   * **Determine the optimal threshold:**  While 1.5 works as a simple "yes/no" split (since the votes are encoded as 1 and 2), you might find a slightly different threshold provides better separation in your real data.  This could be due to class imbalances or other factors.

2. **Feature Encoding:** The votes are encoded as 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no." The threshold of 1.5 effectively splits the data into "no" (1) and "yes" (2).

3. **Illustrative Predictions:** The predictions (Democrat if <= 1.5, Republican if > 1.5) are illustrative.  The actual mapping of vote to party will depend on the patterns in your real data.

4. **Using scikit-learn (Recommended):**  For a robust solution, use scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`.  It handles all the calculations (information gain, threshold selection, etc.) automatically.  Here's a basic example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# ... (Load your data into a pandas DataFrame called 'df') ...

# Separate features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', ..., 'export administration act south africa']]
y = df['party affiliation']

# Create and train the decision tree classifier (max_depth=1 for a single split)
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
clf.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = clf.predict(X)

# ... (Evaluate the model, etc.) ...
```


This scikit-learn approach is strongly recommended for real-world applications as it handles data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building efficiently.  The provided `predict` function is primarily for illustrative purposes and understanding the basic logic of a depth-1 decision tree.
