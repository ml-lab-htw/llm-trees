**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list now stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node. This provides insight into the decision path.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds are now based on the voting values (2 for "yes").
* **Simplified Tree:**  I've simplified the tree for clarity and to avoid arbitrary thresholds without real data. A real-world tree would likely be more complex.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The code now correctly interprets the feature encoding (2 for "yes", 1 for "no").
* **Clearer Output:** The output now explicitly states what 1 and 0 represent in the prediction.

**To build a more robust and accurate tree:**

1. **Provide real voting data:**  A dataset of votes and corresponding party affiliations is essential.
2. **Use scikit-learn:**  Libraries like scikit-learn can automatically build decision trees from data, optimize thresholds, and handle more complex scenarios.  The resulting tree will be much more accurate and robust than a hand-crafted one.


The example usage shows how to call the `predict` function with a dictionary of features and how to interpret the output.  Remember that this current tree is just a demonstration.  With real data, the tree structure and predictions would be different and, hopefully, more accurate.
