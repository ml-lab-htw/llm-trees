This function mirrors the logic of the hypothetical decision tree presented earlier, using the correct feature names and encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no). The `nodes` list records the truth values of the conditions at each inner node. This function is ready to be used for prediction given a dictionary `X` containing the voting record.  Remember, this is still a hypothetical tree. Its accuracy depends on how well these chosen votes reflect actual party affiliation in your data (if you were to train a real model).
