**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding:**  The code now uses the correct encoding (2 for "yes" and 1 for "no") for the voting features.
* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds are now explicit comparisons to 2 (representing "yes"). This makes the decision logic clearer.
* **Node Values:** The `nodes` list is populated with boolean values reflecting whether the condition at each inner node is met.
* **Depth:**  The tree now correctly implements a maximum depth of 3.
* **Hypothetical Nature:** I reiterate that the decision logic itself is *hypothetical*, designed for illustration.  A real-world model would be trained on actual data.


To build a truly effective model, you'll need a dataset of voter characteristics and their party affiliations.  You can then use the scikit-learn example I provided earlier to train a decision tree (or other suitable model) on this data, resulting in a much more accurate and robust predictor.
