I can help you create a Python function for a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. However, without the actual voting data, I can only provide a template function with placeholder features and thresholds. 

You'll need to analyze your data to determine which features and thresholds are most effective for classifying party affiliation.

```python
def predict_party(X: dict):
    """Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of voting records, where keys are feature names
                  and values are the corresponding votes (1 for 'yes', 0 for 'no').

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            - prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
            - nodes (list): List of truth values for the inner nodes' conditions.
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize nodes list for a tree of depth 2

    # Example conditions - Replace with meaningful features and thresholds
    # based on your data analysis
    nodes[0] = X['el salvador aid'] == 2  # Example: Voted 'yes' on El Salvador aid 
    nodes[1] = X['education spending'] == 1 # Example: Voted 'no' on education spending

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat 

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
voting_record = {
    'handicapped infants': 2, 
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,  
    'religious groups in schools': 2, 
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2, 
    'mx missile': 1, 
    'immigration': 1, 
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 
    'education spending': 1, 
    'superfund right to sue': 2, 
    'crime': 2, 
    'duty free exports': 1, 
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party(voting_record)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1: Republican, 0: Democrat)")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_party(X)` Function:**
   - Takes a dictionary `X` representing a single voting record as input.
   - Initializes an empty list `nodes` to store the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
   - **Placeholder Conditions:** The conditions within the `if` statements are placeholders. You need to replace them with meaningful conditions based on your data analysis.  For example, you might find that a vote on a specific issue is highly indicative of party affiliation.
   - **Prediction:**  Assigns a predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) based on the decision tree logic.
   - Returns the `prediction` and the `nodes` list.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Creates a sample `voting_record` dictionary (replace with your actual data).
   - Calls the `predict_party` function.
   - Prints the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes. 

**To use this code effectively, you need to:**

1. **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis on your voting records dataset to identify the most important features and appropriate thresholds for your decision tree. 
2. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the placeholder conditions in the `predict_party` function with the conditions you determined from your data analysis.
