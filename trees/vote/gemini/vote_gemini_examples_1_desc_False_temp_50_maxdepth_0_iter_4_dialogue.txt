```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: yes (2) or no (1)
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2 # Aid to Nicaraguan Contras: yes (2) or no (1)


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]: # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican (Likely)
        else: # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0 # Democrat (Leaning)
    else:  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if X['education spending'] == 2: # Voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat (Likely)
        else: # Voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican (Leaning)


    return prediction, nodes


```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions use 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no." The code reflects this encoding.

2. **Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with the appropriate values based on the "yes" (2) and "no" (1) encoding.

3. **Simplified Structure:**  The provided hypothetical tree structure is implemented directly.

4. **Clearer Comments:**  Comments explain the logic at each step, making the code easier to understand.

5. **Return Values:** The function returns the `prediction` (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the `nodes` list, containing the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at each inner node.



**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    # ... other features (not used in this simplified tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat - Leaning)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [True, False]

Y = {
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict(Y)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican - Likely)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


Z = {
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict(Z)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat - Likely)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False]

This improved version is more functional, readable, and adheres to the provided specifications.  Remember that this is still a *hypothetical* example.  With real-world data, you'd use machine learning algorithms to build a much more robust and accurate decision tree.
