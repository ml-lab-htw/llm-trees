**Key Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding Handled:**  The code explicitly checks for the correct encoding of the voting features (2 for yes, 1 for no).
* **Thresholds Replaced:**  The placeholder thresholds in the previous hypothetical tree have been replaced with checks against the voting record (yes/no).
* **Python Function Format:** The code is now a properly formatted Python function that takes a dictionary of features as input.
* **Node Truth Values:**  The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values (0 or 1) for the inner nodes, as requested.
* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure is more closely aligned with the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.



**Important Note:** This function implements the *hypothetical* decision tree structure we discussed earlier.  To create a decision tree based on real data, you'll still need to follow the steps outlined previously (gather data, use a decision tree algorithm). This example code provides a framework for how the resulting tree's logic could be translated into a Python function.
