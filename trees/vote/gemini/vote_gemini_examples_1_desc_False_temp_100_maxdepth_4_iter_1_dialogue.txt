    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The code now correctly uses the feature encoding (2 for "yes" and 1 for "no") in the conditional statements.
* **List of Nodes:** The `nodes` list is initialized with the correct size (3 inner nodes) and populated with the truth values of the conditions at each node.
* **Simplified Structure:** The code reflects the hypothetical decision tree structure provided earlier, making it clearer and more efficient.
* **Example Usage:**  The example input demonstrates how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.


This improved version provides a functional Python representation of the hypothetical decision tree and demonstrates how to use it for prediction.  Remember that this tree is based on assumptions, and a real-world application would require training on real data.
