**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The code directly uses the provided feature encoding (2 for "yes" and 1 for "no").
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds are now based on the "yes" (2) and "no" (1) votes on key issues, reflecting the political landscape.  
* **Simplified Structure:**  The code reflects the decision tree logic more directly, making it easier to understand and maintain.  Unnecessary nested conditions have been removed.
* **Integer Node Values:**  The `nodes` list is now populated with 1s and 0s, as requested.
* **Clearer Comments:** Comments explain the logic at each step, relating it back to the votes.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```


This improved version is more accurate, efficient, and easier to interpret, making it much more useful for understanding the decision-making process. Remember, this is still a simplified example. A true model would be trained on a real dataset for better accuracy and generalization.
