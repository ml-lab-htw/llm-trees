**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no) is used directly in the conditions.

2. **Thresholds:**  Since the features are categorical (yes/no votes), thresholds aren't needed in the same way as with continuous variables. The conditions check for equality with 2 (representing "yes").

3. **Hypothetical Branches:**  The branching logic is still *hypothetical*, mimicking the structure of the earlier example. Real-world data would inform the actual splits.

4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list accurately tracks the truth values (1 if the condition is true, 0 if false) of each decision node.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,  # Yes
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,        # No
    'superfund right to sue': 1,      # No
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output will depend on the hypothetical tree structure.
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True, True, False, False] (because of the chosen values in the dictionary example_vote)
```



To create a decision tree based on real data, you'd need to provide a dataset of votes and party affiliations. You can then use libraries like scikit-learn to train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` and obtain a much more accurate and meaningful model.  The function above serves as a template demonstrating the structure and logic of such a function.
