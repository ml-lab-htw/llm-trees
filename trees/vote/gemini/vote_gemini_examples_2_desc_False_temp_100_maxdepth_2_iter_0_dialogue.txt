**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` representing a voting record.

2. **Node Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list to store the truth values of our two inner decision nodes.

3. **Feature Selection and Thresholds:**
   - I've chosen "physician fee freeze" and "education spending" as the two features based on general political leanings. These might not be the *most* important features without analyzing data.
   - The threshold `== 2` checks if the vote was "yes" (based on your encoding).

4. **Decision Logic:** The nested `if` statements implement the decision tree logic:
   - If a "yes" vote on the physician fee freeze (`nodes[0]`), it leans towards Republican. Then, a "yes" on education spending (`nodes[1]`) would make it more likely a Democrat. 
   - The logic is mirrored for a "no" vote on the physician fee freeze.

**Important Notes:**

- **Data Required:** This is a simplified example. You'll need actual voting data to determine the most statistically significant features and thresholds for an accurate model. 
- **Oversimplification:** A depth-2 tree likely oversimplifies the relationship between voting records and party affiliation.
- **Bias and Fairness:**  Be very cautious about potential biases in the data and the ethical implications of predicting political affiliation. 

This code provides a framework for a depth-2 decision tree classifier. You can adapt it with your data and refine the feature selection and thresholds for improved accuracy.
