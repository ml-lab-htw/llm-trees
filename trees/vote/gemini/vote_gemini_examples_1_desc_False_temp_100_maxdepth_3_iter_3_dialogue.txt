# Example usage (replace with actual data):

    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,

Key Improvements:

* **Correct Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Encoding Handling:**  Correctly handles the specified encoding for votes (2=yes, 1=no) and party affiliation (1=Republican, 0=Democrat).
* **Node List:** Returns a list `nodes` representing the truth values of inner nodes, as requested.
* **Clearer Logic:** The if-else structure directly reflects the decision tree logic.
* **Example Usage:** Includes an example demonstrating how to use the function.

This revised code provides a functional Python representation of the hypothetical decision tree, ready to be tested with real data.  Remember that the accuracy of the predictions depends entirely on the quality and representativeness of the training data used to develop a real-world decision tree model.
