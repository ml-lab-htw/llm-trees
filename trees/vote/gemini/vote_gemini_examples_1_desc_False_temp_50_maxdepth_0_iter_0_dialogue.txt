This Python function directly implements the hypothetical decision tree. It returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list representing the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember, this tree is based on *assumed* relationships and not actual data analysis.  A real-world model would require training on a dataset.
