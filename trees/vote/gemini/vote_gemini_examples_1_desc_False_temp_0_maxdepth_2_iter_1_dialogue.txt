    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Encoding Alignment:** The code now correctly uses the provided encoding (2 for 'yes' and 1 for 'no'). The conditions in the decision tree check for a value of 2, aligning with the Republican leaning for "physician fee freeze" (voting no) and "aid to nicaraguan contras" (voting yes).

2. **"Else If" Logic:** The `elif` statement is now used to ensure the logic flows as intended.  If the first condition (`nodes[0]`) is true (voted against physician fee freeze, suggesting Republican), the prediction is made and the second condition is skipped.  Only if the first condition is false is the second condition checked.

3. **Clearer Comments:**  Comments are added to clarify the reasoning behind the chosen features and the expected voting patterns.

4. **Example Usage:**  An example dictionary `example_data` is included to demonstrate how to use the function. Remember to replace this with your actual data.


**Key Point about Depth 2:** The original prompt asked for a depth-2 tree. This implementation effectively achieves that because the second condition (`nodes[1]`) is only checked if the first one is false. This is equivalent to a nested structure, but slightly more concise in this specific scenario. If we had a true depth-2 tree with multiple branches on each level, the code structure would be slightly more complex, involving nested `if/else` statements.
