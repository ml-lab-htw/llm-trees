This function implements the hypothetical decision tree described previously, tailored to the specific feature names and encoding you provided.  The function returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of truth values (0 or 1) corresponding to the conditions evaluated at each inner node. This allows for tracing the path the function took to arrive at its prediction. Remember, this tree is *not* trained on real data, so its accuracy is unknown and likely poor in a real-world scenario. It's for illustrative purposes only.
