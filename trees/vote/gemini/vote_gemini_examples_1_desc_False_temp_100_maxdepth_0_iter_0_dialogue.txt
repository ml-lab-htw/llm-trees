This function implements the hypothetical decision tree described previously.  Remember, this is a *demonstration*, not a trained model. The choices of "physician fee freeze," "aid to Nicaraguan contras," and "education spending" as branching features, and the thresholds, are for illustrative purposes.  A real-world decision tree would be learned from data and would likely have a different structure and thresholds.  The function demonstrates the structure and how feature values are used to traverse the tree to arrive at a prediction, as well as how to record the boolean values for each decision node.
