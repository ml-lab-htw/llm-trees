```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Vote yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['education spending'] == 2 # Vote yes on education spending


    if nodes[0]:
        if X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2:  # Vote yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else: # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:
          prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else:
          prediction = 1 # Republican


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Conditions:** The conditions now directly use the feature values (2 for "yes," 1 for "no") and compare them using `==`. This is more explicit than just checking the boolean value of the vote, making the logic easier to follow.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've used the votes themselves as the decision points, reflecting the hypothetical structure we discussed earlier. In a real-world scenario, these would be determined by the decision tree algorithm during training.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree remains relatively simple, as it's still a hypothetical example. With more data, a real decision tree might have a more complex branching structure.
* **List of Truth Values:** The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the conditions at each node.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,  # No
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1, # No
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, False] (or [1, 0])
```


Remember that this function and its predictions are still based on a *hypothetical* decision tree structure. To get accurate and meaningful predictions, you need to train a real decision tree model on a dataset of voter data.  If you provide the data, I can assist you in doing so.
