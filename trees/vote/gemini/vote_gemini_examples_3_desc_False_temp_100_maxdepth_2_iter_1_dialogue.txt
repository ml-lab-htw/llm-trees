I understand now! You want a Python function that represents a decision tree based on voting records, with a maximum depth of 2, and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for inner nodes. 

**Assumptions:**

- I'll assume, for this example, that the votes "aid to nicaraguan contras" and "education spending" are the two most important features for this decision tree. 
- I'll use a threshold of 1.5 (since votes are 1 or 2) to represent a "yes" vote.

```python
def predict_party(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

    Args:
        X: A dictionary representing the voting record,
               e.g., {'handicapped infants': 2, 'water project cost sharing': 1, ...}.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - The predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
            - A list of truth values for inner nodes (1 if condition met, 0 otherwise).
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None]  # For a depth-2 tree

    # Decision Node 1: Aid to Nicaraguan Contras
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] > 1.5

    # Decision Node 2: Education Spending 
    nodes[1] = X['education spending'] > 1.5

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted "yes" on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
        else:  # Voted "no" on education spending
            prediction = 0 # Likely Democrat 
    else:  # Voted "no" on aid to Nicaraguan contras
        prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat

    return prediction, nodes 


# Example usage:
example_vote = {'handicapped infants': 2, 
                 'water project cost sharing': 1,
                 'adoption of the budget resolution': 2, 
                 'physician fee freeze': 1, 
                 'el salvador aid': 1, 
                 'religious groups in schools': 2, 
                 'anti satellite test ban': 1, 
                 'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2, 
                 'mx missile': 1, 
                 'immigration': 1, 
                 'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 
                 'education spending': 2, 
                 'superfund right to sue': 2, 
                 'crime': 2, 
                 'duty free exports': 1, 
                 'export administration act south africa': 2}

prediction, inner_nodes = predict_party(example_vote)
print(f"Predicted Party: {prediction}")  
print(f"Inner Node Truth Values: {inner_nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_party(X)` Function:**
   - Takes a dictionary `X` representing a voting record.
   - Initializes `nodes` as a list to store the truth values of the decision nodes.
   - Implements the decision logic based on the two selected features and their thresholds.
   - Returns the predicted party and the `nodes` list.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - Provides an example `example_vote` dictionary.
   - Calls the `predict_party` function.
   - Prints the prediction and the inner node truth values.

**Important:** This is a highly simplified example. In reality, you would need a larger dataset, a more robust method for feature selection, and potentially a deeper or more complex decision tree to make accurate predictions.
