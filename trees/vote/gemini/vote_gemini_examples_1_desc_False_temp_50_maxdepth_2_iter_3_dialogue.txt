    Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

    Args:
        X: A dictionary of voting records, with keys matching the feature names.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - prediction: The predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
            - nodes: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Usage:** The code directly uses the provided feature names and encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no) to make the decision tree logic clearer.
* **Aligned with Hypothetical Tree:** The logic implements the previously described hypothetical tree, where a "yes" vote on either "physician fee freeze" or "aid to Nicaraguan contras" leads to a Republican prediction.  
* **Handling Missing Values (Important):** In a real-world scenario, you might have missing data.  You'd need to add logic to handle this. A simple approach would be to assign a default value (e.g., the most common vote) or create a separate branch in the tree for missing values.  More sophisticated imputation methods also exist.
* **Threshold Selection:** I've removed the arbitrary thresholds that were in the initial hypothetical example since the votes are categorical (yes/no). Using thresholds on categorical variables encoded as 1 or 2 could lead to incorrect classifications. If you use thresholds, it should be on continuous numeric data.


**Example Usage:**

```python
voter_1 = {'handicapped infants': 1, 'water project cost sharing': 2, 'adoption of the budget resolution': 2, 'physician fee freeze': 2, 'el salvador aid': 2, 'religious groups in schools': 2, 'anti satellite test ban': 1, 'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1, 'mx missile': 1, 'immigration': 1, 'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 'education spending': 2, 'superfund right to sue': 2, 'crime': 2, 'duty free exports': 1, 'export administration act south africa': 2}
prediction, nodes = predict(voter_1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output will be [True, False] because physician fee freeze is 2 (yes), and aid to nicaraguan contras is 1 (no)

voter_2 = {'handicapped infants': 1, 'water project cost sharing': 1, 'adoption of the budget resolution': 1, 'physician fee freeze': 1, 'el salvador aid': 1, 'religious groups in schools': 1, 'anti satellite test ban': 2, 'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2, 'mx missile': 1, 'immigration': 1, 'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 'education spending': 1, 'superfund right to sue': 1, 'crime': 1, 'duty free exports': 1, 'export administration act south africa': 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(voter_2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output will be [False, True] because physician fee freeze is 1 (no), and aid to nicaraguan contras is 2 (yes)

voter_3 = {'handicapped infants': 1, 'water project cost sharing': 1, 'adoption of the budget resolution': 1, 'physician fee freeze': 1, 'el salvador aid': 1, 'religious groups in schools': 1, 'anti satellite test ban': 1, 'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1, 'mx missile': 1, 'immigration': 1, 'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 'education spending': 1, 'superfund right to sue': 1, 'crime': 1, 'duty free exports': 1, 'export administration act south africa': 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(voter_3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output will be [False, False] because physician fee freeze is 1 (no), and aid to nicaraguan contras is 1 (no)
