I can certainly help you with that. However, without access to data to determine the most important features and appropriate thresholds, I can only provide a template function based on your hypothetical example. 

**Assumed Important Features and Thresholds (Based on Your Example):**

1.  **'el salvador aid'**: A "yes" vote (value 2) strongly indicates Democrat, a "no" vote (value 1) leans Republican.
2.  **'education spending'**: A "yes" vote (value 2) leans Democrat, a "no" vote (value 1) strongly indicates Republican.

**Python Function (Depth 2):**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing voting records (keys are feature names).

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - prediction: Predicted party affiliation (1: Republican, 0: Democrat)
      - nodes: A list of truth values for inner node conditions.
  """
  nodes = 2 * [None]  # For a depth 2 tree
  
  # Node 1: 'el salvador aid'
  nodes[0] = X['el salvador aid'] == 2  # True if vote is "yes"

  # Node 2: 'education spending' (only evaluated if Node 1 is False)
  nodes[1] = X['education spending'] == 1  # True if vote is "no"

  # Decision Logic:
  if nodes[0]: 
    prediction = 0  # Democrat (strong indicator)
  else: 
    if nodes[1]:
      prediction = 1  # Republican (strong indicator)
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Democrat (leaning)

  return prediction, nodes 

# Example Usage:
voting_record = {'el salvador aid': 1, 'education spending': 2}
prediction, nodes = predict(voting_record)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1: Republican, 0: Democrat)")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Function Definition:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single voting record as input.
2.  **Node Initialization:**  `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node. It's initialized with `None`.
3.  **Node Conditions:**
    *   `nodes[0]` checks if the vote on 'el salvador aid' is 2 ("yes").
    *   `nodes[1]` checks if the vote on 'education spending' is 1 ("no"). This node is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is False (meaning the 'el salvador aid' vote was not "yes").
4.  **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision logic of the tree based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.
5.  **Return Values:** The function returns the predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the `nodes` list.

**Important:**

*   **Data Required:** You'll need real data to determine the actual important features, thresholds, and to build a more accurate decision tree.
*   **Feature Importance and Thresholds:** The current example uses assumed features and thresholds. You'll need to use a decision tree algorithm on your data to identify the most important features and appropriate thresholds for splitting.
*   **Depth and Complexity:**  A depth of 2 might be too limited for this problem. You may need to experiment with greater depth or more sophisticated models to capture the complexity of the relationship between voting records and party affiliation.
