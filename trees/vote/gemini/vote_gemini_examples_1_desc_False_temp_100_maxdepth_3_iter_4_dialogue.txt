**Important Notes:**

* **Hypothetical Thresholds:**  The thresholds I used in the `predict` function are based on general assumptions about Republican and Democrat voting patterns.  These are *not* based on real analysis and would need to be determined using a decision tree training algorithm with real data.
* **Depth 3:** The `predict` function implements a decision tree of depth 3, as requested.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list contains boolean values (True/False) representing whether the condition at each node is met. You can convert these to 1/0 using `int(node)` if needed.
* **Data Required:**  To create a truly accurate model, you *must* train a decision tree algorithm on a dataset of congressional voting records with the associated party affiliations.  This code only provides a framework.  The real power of decision trees comes from learning the optimal splits from the data.
