**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing a single voting record.

2. **Nodes List:** `nodes = 3 * [None]` initializes a list to store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node.  A depth-2 tree has a maximum of 3 inner nodes.

3. **Root Node (Level 1):**
   - `nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2` checks if the vote for 'aid to nicaraguan contras' is 2 (yes).
   - If True, it means the person voted "yes" on this issue.

4. **Branching (Level 2):**
   - `if nodes[0]:`  This block executes if the person voted "yes" on Contras aid.
      -  `nodes[1] = X['education spending'] == 2`  checks the vote on Education Spending.
   - `else:`  This block executes if the person voted "no" on Contras aid.
      - `nodes[2] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2` checks the vote on Physician Fee Freeze.

5. **Leaf Nodes (Predictions):**
   - Inside each of the nested `if/else` blocks at Level 2, we assign a prediction of 1 (Republican) or 0 (Democrat) based on the combination of votes. These are our simplified assumptions based on the hypothetical feature importance example.

6. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns a tuple containing:
     - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 or 0).
     - `nodes`: The list of truth values for the inner nodes (used for understanding the decision path).

**Important:**

* **Hypothetical Example:**  The chosen features and thresholds are based on the previous hypothetical example. You'll need to perform actual feature importance analysis on a real dataset to determine the most relevant features and appropriate split points.
* **Simplification:** A depth-2 tree might be too simplistic for this problem. Consider increasing the depth or using more sophisticated algorithms if you have enough data.
