This function implements the hypothetical decision tree described earlier.  It uses the provided feature names and the specified encoding (2 for "yes" and 1 for "no").  The `nodes` list stores the boolean truth values (True/False, which are equivalent to 1/0 in Python for conditional checks) of each decision node, allowing you to trace the path through the tree. This function does not require training because it is based on pre-defined rules rather than learned patterns from data.  Remember, this is a simplified example, and a real-world application would involve training a model on actual data.
