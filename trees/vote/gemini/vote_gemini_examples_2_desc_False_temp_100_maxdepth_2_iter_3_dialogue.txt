You got it! Here's a Python function representing a decision tree with a depth of 2 for predicting political affiliation based on the provided voting data. Keep in mind that without the actual voting data, I'm making educated guesses about which features are most important and the threshold values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts political affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on voting record.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of voting records, with feature keys as specified 
                  in your prompt. Values are 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            - prediction (int): 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
            - nodes (list): List of truth values for each inner node condition.
    """
    
    nodes = 2 * [None] 

    # Hypothetical important features & thresholds:
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # Did they vote YES on aid to contras?
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2 # Did they vote YES on physician fee freeze?

    if nodes[0]:  # Strong support for contras likely indicates Republican
        prediction = 1 
    else:
        if nodes[1]: #  If they didn't strongly support contras, but DID support fee freeze, likely Republican
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0 

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage (replace with actual voting data):
example_vote = {
    'handicapped infants': 2, 
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    # ... (add other voting records)
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    # ... (rest of the features)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)

print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I've chosen "aid to nicaraguan contras" and "physician fee freeze" as potentially important features based on general political leanings in the period these votes likely took place. *You'll need to analyze the actual voting data to determine the truly most important features.*

2. **Thresholds:** I'm using a simple threshold of "2" (meaning a "yes" vote) for both features. Again, these thresholds might need adjustment based on data analysis.

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - **Root Node (nodes[0]):** If a politician voted "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are more likely to be Republican (based on historical trends).
   - **Second Level (nodes[1]):** If they did *not* strongly support the contras, but *did* support a physician fee freeze, that further suggests a Republican leaning.

**Important:** This is a highly simplified example. To create a truly effective decision tree, you need to:

* **Analyze Real Voting Data:** Identify the most important features and their appropriate thresholds.
* **Consider Model Complexity:**  A depth-2 tree might be too simple.  Explore deeper trees or other algorithms for potentially better accuracy. 
* **Evaluate Performance:** Test your model on unseen data to measure its accuracy and generalizability.
