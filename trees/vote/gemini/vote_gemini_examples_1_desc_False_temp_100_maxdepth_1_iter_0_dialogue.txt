**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Selection:** The code currently uses  'aid to nicaraguan contras' as the splitting feature. This is a placeholder.  To determine the *actual* best feature for a depth-1 tree, you need to analyze a dataset of voting records and party affiliations using feature importance metrics (like Gini impurity, Information Gain, or Chi-squared test).
* **Encoding:**  The code correctly handles the provided encoding (2 for "yes", 1 for "no").
* **Depth-1 Limitation:**  Remember that a depth-1 tree is very simplistic.  With a real dataset, it's likely that a single voting issue won't perfectly separate the parties.  A more complex tree (greater depth) or a different classification algorithm would probably yield better results.



If you provide a dataset, I can help you determine the best feature and create a more data-driven depth-1 decision tree function.  Or, I can help you build a more complex and accurate model if desired.
