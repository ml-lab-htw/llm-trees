```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: 2=yes, Republican leaning
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2 # Aid to Contras: 2=yes, Republican leaning

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that "yes" votes are encoded as 2, and "no" votes as 1.  The code now correctly reflects this.

2. **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.

3. **No Thresholds Needed:** For categorical features like these votes, we directly check for the "yes" value (2) rather than using thresholds.

4. **Consistent with Hypothetical Tree:**  The Python function now accurately implements the previously described decision tree logic using 'physician fee freeze' and 'aid to nicaraguan contras' as the splitting features.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1, # Voted no
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2, # Voted yes
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, True]
```


This example demonstrates how the function would classify a hypothetical voter.  Remember, the accuracy of this classifier depends entirely on the quality and representativeness of the training data used to create the decision tree logic in the first place.  This implementation uses the hypothesized importance of the selected features. With real-world data, you would use a machine learning algorithm to learn the best splits and features.
