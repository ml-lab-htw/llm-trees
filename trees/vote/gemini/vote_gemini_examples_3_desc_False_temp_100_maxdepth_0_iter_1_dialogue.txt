I can't create a truly accurate decision tree without training data. However, based on common political positions, I can create a *demonstration* function with a plausible, but simplified, decision tree.  This is for illustrative purposes and shouldn't be used for real-world political analysis.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Simplified decision tree based on stereotypical voting patterns.
    # These thresholds are placeholders and would need to be learned from real data.
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze (more likely Republican)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2  # Voted yes on education spending (more likely Democrat)
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2 # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras (more likely Republican)



    if nodes[0]:  #  Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]: # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else: # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras, but yes on physician fee freeze
            prediction = 1 # Republican (still leaning Republican based on the first vote)
    else: # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]: # Voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else: # Voted no on both physician fee freeze and education spending
            prediction = 1 #  Likely Republican (This is a weak assumption - more features needed)

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage (replace with your own feature values):
example_voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")

```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Feature Selection:** The provided example uses features that are likely to be somewhat indicative of party affiliation (though this is a simplification).  In a real application, feature importance would be determined through analysis of actual data.
* **Thresholds:** The code now includes placeholder thresholds.  A machine learning algorithm would learn these thresholds from data.  The current values are guesses based on general political alignments.
* **Structure:** The `if/else` structure implements the decision tree logic.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at each inner node.
* **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates how to call the `predict` function and interpret the output.
* **Comments:**  I've added comments to explain the logic and limitations.


**To make this a truly effective decision tree, you *must* provide real voting data with party affiliations.**  With that data, I can train a model to find the best features and thresholds, resulting in a much more accurate prediction function.
