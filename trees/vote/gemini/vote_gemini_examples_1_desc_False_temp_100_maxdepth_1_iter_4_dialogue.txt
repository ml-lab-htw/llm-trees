```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # Assuming '2' represents 'yes'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Assuming 'yes' on physician fee freeze leans Republican. This NEEDS DATA VALIDATION!
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Assuming 'no' or other value leans Democrat.  This NEEDS DATA VALIDATION!

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided information states that a "yes" vote is encoded as `2` and "no" as `1`.  The code reflects this using `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2`.

2. **Placeholder Threshold:**  Since a depth-1 tree uses only one feature, there's no need for a numerical threshold like in the example you gave (HbA1c <= 6.7).  We're simply checking if the vote was "yes" or not.

3. **Data-Driven Decision:**  The **most critical** point is that assigning Republican to "yes" and Democrat to "no" is a **pure assumption**. In reality, this relationship needs to be determined from the actual data.  You would calculate the information gain or Gini impurity for each feature to find the best split.  It's entirely possible that "yes" on physician fee freeze correlates more strongly with Democrats in your dataset.  Without analyzing the data, we can't know.

4. **Using a Machine Learning Library:** To properly build this decision tree, you *must* use a library like scikit-learn (in Python) or a similar tool in your preferred language. Provide the library with your voting data and party affiliations, and it will determine the optimal feature and split for you.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    # ... (other votes) ...,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Yes vote
    # ... (rest of the features)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Republican, based on our ASSUMPTION)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [True]
```

Remember to replace the assumptions about the relationship between "physician fee freeze" and party affiliation with data-driven results.  The provided code only illustrates the structure of a depth-1 decision tree based on a single feature.
