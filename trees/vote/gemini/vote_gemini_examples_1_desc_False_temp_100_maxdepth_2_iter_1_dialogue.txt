**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Hypothetical Tree:** This decision tree is based on hypothesized important features ("physician fee freeze" and "adoption of the budget resolution").  In a real application, you *must* determine feature importance using a dataset and a decision tree training algorithm (like the scikit-learn example in my previous response).

2. **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (checking if the vote is equal to 2 for "yes") are also based on the encoding you provided (2 for "yes", 1 for "no").

3. **Depth 2:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2, as required.

4. **`nodes` List:**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean values (True/False, which will be converted to 1/0) representing whether the conditions at each inner node are met. This provides information about the path taken through the tree for a given input.

5. **No Training:**  As requested, this function does *not* train on data. It implements a fixed decision tree structure based on assumed important features.

6. **Real-World Application:** To build a useful model, you **must** replace the placeholder features and thresholds with those derived from analyzing your actual data.  Use the scikit-learn example from my previous response to train and evaluate a decision tree on your dataset.  This will give you a much more accurate and reliable model.


This revised answer provides the function in the requested format, clarifies the assumptions made, and emphasizes the importance of using real data and training for a practical application.
