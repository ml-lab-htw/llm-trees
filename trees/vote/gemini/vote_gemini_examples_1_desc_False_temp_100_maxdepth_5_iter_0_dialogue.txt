**Key Improvements:**

* **Correct Feature Names and Encoding:** The code now uses the exact feature names and their specified encoding (2 for 'yes', 1 for 'no').
* **Clearer Conditions:** The conditions in the `if/else` statements are more explicit, referencing the feature values directly.
* **Adjusted Nodes List:** The `nodes` list has been adjusted to have 4 elements to match the decision tree structure (maximum depth 5 leads to 4 levels of decision nodes).
* **Example Usage:** Added an example demonstrating how to use the `predict` function with a sample dictionary of votes.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the logic and the encoding.



This improved function correctly implements the decision tree logic based on the provided specifications and returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values. Remember that this is based on a hypothetical example.  With a real dataset, the tree structure and thresholds would be learned from the data using a decision tree learning algorithm.
