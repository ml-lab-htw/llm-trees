Here is the formatted decision tree as a Python function, following the examples provided:

**Features:**

- **handicapped infants**: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **water project cost sharing**: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **adoption of the budget resolution**: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **physician fee freeze**: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **el salvador aid**: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **religious groups in schools**: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **anti satellite test ban**: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **aid to nicaraguan contras**: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **mx missile**: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **immigration**: Vote on immigration (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **synfuels corporation cutback**: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **education spending**: Vote on education spending (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **superfund right to sue**: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **crime**: Vote on crime (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **duty free exports**: Vote on duty free exports (2 = yes / 1 = no)
- **export administration act south africa**: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes / 1 = no)

**Target variable:**

- **party affiliation**: Party affiliation (1 = Republican / 0 = Democrat)

**Decision Tree Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'No' (<=1)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1
    # Node 1: Check if the vote on anti satellite test ban is 'No' (<=1)
    nodes[1] = X["anti satellite test ban"] <= 1

    if not nodes[0]:  # Physician fee freeze vote is 'Yes'
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if not nodes[1]:  # Anti satellite test ban vote is 'Yes'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** checks the vote on the **physician fee freeze**:
  - If the vote is **'Yes'** (value **2**), `X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1` is **False** (`nodes[0] = False`).
  - If the vote is **'No'** (value **1**), `X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1` is **True** (`nodes[0] = True`).
- If `nodes[0]` is **False** (vote was 'Yes'), the prediction is **Republican** (1).
- If `nodes[0]` is **True** (vote was 'No'), proceed to **Node 1**.

- **Node 1** checks the vote on the **anti satellite test ban**:
  - If the vote is **'Yes'** (value **2**), `X["anti satellite test ban"] <= 1` is **False** (`nodes[1] = False`).
  - If the vote is **'No'** (value **1**), `X["anti satellite test ban"] <= 1` is **True** (`nodes[1] = True`).
- If `nodes[1]` is **False** (vote was 'Yes'), the prediction is **Democrat** (0).
- If `nodes[1]` is **True** (vote was 'No'), the prediction is **Republican** (1).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where 'physician fee freeze' vote is 'Yes' and 'anti satellite test ban' is 'No'
X_example = {
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,  # No
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Note:** Replace the values in `X_example` with the actual votes to get predictions for different scenarios.
