Certainly! Based on the decision tree provided and the specific feature spellings and encodings, here is the Python function that implements the decision tree. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns the prediction (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat) along with a list of truth values for each inner node condition.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze == no (encoded as 1)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 1)

    if nodes[0]:  # If Vote on physician fee freeze == no
        # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == no (encoded as 1)
        nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1)

        if nodes[1]:  # If Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == no
            # Node 2: Vote on education spending == no (encoded as 1)
            nodes[2] = int(X["education spending"] == 1)

            if nodes[2]:  # If Vote on education spending == no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Vote on education spending == yes
                # Node 3: Vote on crime == no (encoded as 1)
                nodes[3] = int(X["crime"] == 1)

                if nodes[3]:  # If Vote on crime == no
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:  # Vote on crime == yes
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Vote on physician fee freeze == yes
        # Node 4: Vote on aid to nicaraguan contras == no (encoded as 1)
        nodes[4] = int(X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1)

        if nodes[4]:  # If Vote on aid to nicaraguan contras == no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Vote on aid to nicaraguan contras == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Each vote feature is encoded as `2` for "yes" and `1` for "no".
  - The target variable `party affiliation` is encoded as `1` for Republican and `0` for Democrat.

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if "physician fee freeze" vote is `no` (`1`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if "adoption of the budget resolution" vote is `no`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if "education spending" vote is `no`.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if "crime" vote is `no`.
  - `nodes[4]`: Checks if "aid to nicaraguan contras" vote is `no`.

- **Logic Flow:**
  - The function follows the decision tree structure provided.
  - It uses the specified feature keys and encodings.
  - At each node, it checks the condition and proceeds accordingly.
  - The function returns the final prediction and the list of nodes where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,  # yes
    'water project cost sharing': 1,  # no
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,  # no
    'physician fee freeze': 1,  # no
    'el salvador aid': 2,  # yes
    'religious groups in schools': 1,  # no
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,  # yes
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,  # yes
    'mx missile': 1,  # no
    'immigration': 2,  # yes
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,  # no
    'education spending': 2,  # yes
    'superfund right to sue': 2,  # yes
    'crime': 1,  # no
    'duty free exports': 2,  # yes
    'export administration act south africa': 1  # no
}

# Get prediction and node conditions
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat):", prediction)
print("Node conditions (1=condition satisfied, 0=not satisfied):", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): 0
Node conditions (1=condition satisfied, 0=not satisfied): [1, 1, 0, 1, None]
```

**Note:**

- In this example, the prediction is `0`, indicating a Democrat.
- The `nodes` list shows which conditions were satisfied (`1`) and which were not (`0`).
- `nodes[4]` is `None` because it was not evaluated in this path of the tree.
