```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)  # 2 = yes, 1 = no
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on the vote on the "physician fee freeze" issue.

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - **"physician fee freeze":** 
    - **2** represents a **'yes'** vote.
    - **1** represents a **'no'** vote.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - **1** represents **Republican**.
  - **0** represents **Democrat**.

**Function Breakdown:**

1. **Initialize Nodes List:**

   ```python
   nodes = [None] * 1
   ```
   
   - Creates a list `nodes` with one element initialized to `None`. This list will store the truth value (1 or 0) of the inner node condition.

2. **Evaluate the Condition at the Root Node:**

   ```python
   nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)
   ```
   
   - Checks if the value of `"physician fee freeze"` in the input `X` is equal to `2` (which means a 'yes' vote).
   - Converts the boolean result (`True` or `False`) to an integer (`1` or `0`) and stores it in `nodes[0]`.
     - If the condition is **True** (vote is 'yes'), `nodes[0]` will be `1`.
     - If the condition is **False** (vote is 'no'), `nodes[0]` will be `0`.

3. **Make the Prediction Based on the Condition:**

   ```python
   if nodes[0]:
       prediction = 1  # Republican
   else:
       prediction = 0  # Democrat
   ```
   
   - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition satisfied), the prediction is `1` (Republican).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (condition not satisfied), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).

4. **Return the Prediction and the Nodes List:**

   ```python
   return prediction, nodes
   ```
   
   - Returns the predicted class and the list of node truth values.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a voting record for a congressperson:

```python
voting_record = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Voted 'yes'
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_record)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1]
```

- The function predicts that the congressperson is a **Republican** because they voted **'yes'** on the physician fee freeze.
- The `nodes` list shows `[1]`, indicating that the condition at the root node was satisfied.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct spelling and casing as specified:

  ```python
  ['handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 'adoption of the budget resolution',
   'physician fee freeze', 'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools',
   'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras', 'mx missile', 'immigration',
   'synfuels corporation cutback', 'education spending', 'superfund right to sue',
   'crime', 'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa']
  ```

- The feature values should be encoded as **2** for **'yes'** and **1** for **'no'** to match the encoding used in the function.

**Conclusion:**

This simple decision tree uses the most informative feature to classify party affiliation with a maximum depth of 1. The function provides both the prediction and the evaluation of the inner node(s), allowing for transparency in how the prediction was made.
