Certainly! Based on the decision tree provided earlier, here's a Python function that predicts party affiliation (`1` for Republican and `0` for Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The entries in the list are `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze == yes (2)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["physician fee freeze"] == 2 else 0

    # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == yes (2)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2 else 0 if nodes[0] == 1 else None

    # Node 2: Vote on duty free exports == yes (2)
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["duty free exports"] == 2 else 0 if nodes[0] == 1 and nodes[1] == 0 else None

    # Node 3: Vote on education spending == yes (2)
    nodes[3] = 1 if X["education spending"] == 2 else 0 if nodes[0] == 0 else None

    # Node 4: Vote on aid to nicaraguan contras == yes (2)
    nodes[4] = 1 if X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2 else 0 if nodes[0] == 0 and nodes[3] == 0 else None

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        elif nodes[1] == 0:
            if nodes[2] == 1:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            elif nodes[2] == 0:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    elif nodes[0] == 0:
        if nodes[3] == 1:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        elif nodes[3] == 0:
            if nodes[4] == 1:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            elif nodes[4] == 0:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**
  - We initialize a list `nodes` of length 5 to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - Each node corresponds to a condition in the decision tree.

- **Evaluating Nodes:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the "physician fee freeze" vote is "yes" (`2`).
    - `nodes[0] = 1` if the vote is "yes"; otherwise, `nodes[0] = 0`.
  - **Node 1:** Evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 1`.
    - Checks if the "adoption of the budget resolution" vote is "yes".
  - **Node 2:** Evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 1` and `nodes[1] == 0`.
    - Checks if the "duty free exports" vote is "yes".
  - **Node 3:** Evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 0`.
    - Checks if the "education spending" vote is "yes".
  - **Node 4:** Evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 0` and `nodes[3] == 0`.
    - Checks if the "aid to nicaraguan contras" vote is "yes".

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If `nodes[0] == 1`:**
    - **If `nodes[1] == 1`:** Predict **Republican** (`1`).
    - **Else (`nodes[1] == 0`):**
      - **If `nodes[2] == 1`:** Predict **Republican** (`1`).
      - **Else (`nodes[2] == 0`):** Predict **Democrat** (`0`).
  - **Else (`nodes[0] == 0`):**
    - **If `nodes[3] == 1`:** Predict **Democrat** (`0`).
    - **Else (`nodes[3] == 0`):**
      - **If `nodes[4] == 1`:** Predict **Republican** (`1`).
      - **Else (`nodes[4] == 0`):** Predict **Democrat** (`0`).

- **Returning the Result:**
  - The function returns the `prediction` (party affiliation) and the list of `nodes` indicating the truth values of each condition evaluated.

**Note on Feature Encoding:**

- All votes are encoded as:
  - `2` for "yes"
  - `1` for "no"
- The target variable (`party affiliation`) is encoded as:
  - `1` for **Republican**
  - `0` for **Democrat**

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): 1
Nodes truth values: [1, 1, None, None, None]
```

- In this example, the individual voted "yes" (`2`) on "physician fee freeze" and "adoption of the budget resolution".
- According to the decision tree, this leads to a prediction of **Republican** (`1`).
- The `nodes` list shows which conditions were evaluated and their truth values.

**Explanation of Nodes List:**

- `nodes[0] = 1`: The condition `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2` is satisfied.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The condition `X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2` is satisfied.
- `nodes[2] = None`: This node wasn't evaluated because `nodes[1]` was already `1`.
- `nodes[3] = None`: Not evaluated since `nodes[0]` was `1`.
- `nodes[4] = None`: Not evaluated.

**Important Notes:**

- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct spelling and casing as specified.
- **Missing Values:** If a vote is missing in `X`, the function may raise a `KeyError`. It's important to handle missing data appropriately in practice.
- **Extensibility:** The function is based on the provided decision tree. For more complex trees or different datasets, the function would need to be adjusted accordingly.
