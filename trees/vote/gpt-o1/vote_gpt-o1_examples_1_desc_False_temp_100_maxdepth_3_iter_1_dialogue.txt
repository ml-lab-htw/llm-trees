Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation based on the specified voting features. The function returns a prediction (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican) and a list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [0]
    # Node 0: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2 else 0

    # Node 1: Vote on physician fee freeze == 'no' (encoded as 1)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['physician fee freeze'] == 1 else 0

    # Node 2: Vote on el salvador aid == 'no' (encoded as 1)
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['el salvador aid'] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted 'yes' on the budget resolution
        if nodes[1]:
            # Voted 'no' on the physician fee freeze
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Voted 'no' on the budget resolution
        if nodes[2]:
            # Voted 'no' on el salvador aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - `'yes'` votes are encoded as `2`.
  - `'no'` votes are encoded as `1`.
- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the congressperson voted **'yes'** on the adoption of the budget resolution.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if they voted **'no'** on the physician fee freeze.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if they voted **'no'** on el salvador aid.
- **Prediction:**
  - `0` represents **Democrat**.
  - `1` represents **Republican**.

**Decision Logic:**

1. **Node 0:** `Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == 'yes'`
   - If **True** (`nodes[0] == 1`):
     - Proceed to **Node 1**.
   - If **False** (`nodes[0] == 0`):
     - Proceed to **Node 2**.

2. **Node 1:** `Vote on physician fee freeze == 'no'`
   - If **True** (`nodes[1] == 1`):
     - **Prediction:** Democrat (`prediction = 0`)
   - If **False** (`nodes[1] == 0`):
     - **Prediction:** Republican (`prediction = 1`)

3. **Node 2:** `Vote on el salvador aid == 'no'`
   - If **True** (`nodes[2] == 1`):
     - **Prediction:** Democrat (`prediction = 0`)
   - If **False** (`nodes[2] == 0`):
     - **Prediction:** Republican (`prediction = 1`)

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Sample input
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,              # 'yes'
    'water project cost sharing': 1,       # 'no'
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,  # 'yes'
    'physician fee freeze': 1,             # 'no'
    'el salvador aid': 1,                  # 'no'
    'religious groups in schools': 2,      # 'yes'
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,          # 'no'
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,        # 'yes'
    'mx missile': 1,                       # 'no'
    'immigration': 2,                      # 'yes'
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,     # 'no'
    'education spending': 2,               # 'yes'
    'superfund right to sue': 1,           # 'no'
    'crime': 2,                            # 'yes'
    'duty free exports': 1,                # 'no'
    'export administration act south africa': 2  # 'yes'
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [1, 1, 1]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1` → Voted **'yes'** on the budget resolution.
  - `nodes[1] = 1` → Voted **'no'** on the physician fee freeze.
  - `nodes[2] = 1` → Voted **'no'** on el salvador aid.
- **Decision Path:**
  - Since `nodes[0] == 1`, we proceed to `nodes[1]`.
  - `nodes[1] == 1` leads to a **Democrat** prediction.
- **Final Prediction:** **Democrat**

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` includes **all** the required features with exact keys and correct encodings.
- The function strictly follows the structure of the decision tree with a maximum depth of 3.
- The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the conditions at each node:
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
- If a feature is missing from `X`, a `KeyError` will occur. Make sure to provide all necessary feature values.
