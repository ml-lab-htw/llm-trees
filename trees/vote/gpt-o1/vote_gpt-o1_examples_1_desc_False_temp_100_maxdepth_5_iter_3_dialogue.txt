Certainly! Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree, using the exact feature names and encodings provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` representing a single data point with the specified features and returns the predicted party affiliation along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes of the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 5  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: 'physician fee freeze' == 2 ('yes')
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: 'el salvador aid' == 2 ('yes')
        nodes[1] = int(X['el salvador aid'] == 2)

        if nodes[1]:
            # Class: Republican (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Node 2: 'handicapped infants' == 1 ('no')
            nodes[2] = int(X['handicapped infants'] == 1)

            if nodes[2]:
                # Class: Republican (1)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Class: Democrat (0)
                prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 3: 'adoption of the budget resolution' == 2 ('yes')
        nodes[3] = int(X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2)

        if nodes[3]:
            # Class: Democrat (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 4: 'water project cost sharing' == 1 ('no')
            nodes[4] = int(X['water project cost sharing'] == 1)

            if nodes[4]:
                # Class: Democrat (0)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # Class: Republican (1)
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a list `nodes` with five zeros to store the truth values (1 or 0) of the inner nodes of the decision tree.

2. **Decision Tree Conditions:**
   - **Node 0:** Checks if the vote on the **physician fee freeze** is 'yes' (`2`).
     ```python
     nodes[0] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 2)
     ```
   - If **Node 0** is `True` (`1`):
     - **Node 1:** Checks if the vote on **el salvador aid** is 'yes' (`2`).
       ```python
       nodes[1] = int(X['el salvador aid'] == 2)
       ```
     - If **Node 1** is `True` (`1`):
       - **Prediction:** Republican (`1`).
     - Else:
       - **Node 2:** Checks if the vote on **handicapped infants** is 'no' (`1`).
         ```python
         nodes[2] = int(X['handicapped infants'] == 1)
         ```
       - If **Node 2** is `True` (`1`):
         - **Prediction:** Republican (`1`).
       - Else:
         - **Prediction:** Democrat (`0`).
   - Else:
     - **Node 3:** Checks if the vote on **adoption of the budget resolution** is 'yes' (`2`).
       ```python
       nodes[3] = int(X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2)
       ```
     - If **Node 3** is `True` (`1`):
       - **Prediction:** Democrat (`0`).
     - Else:
       - **Node 4:** Checks if the vote on **water project cost sharing** is 'no' (`1`).
         ```python
         nodes[4] = int(X['water project cost sharing'] == 1)
         ```
       - If **Node 4** is `True` (`1`):
         - **Prediction:** Democrat (`0`).
       - Else:
         - **Prediction:** Republican (`1`).

3. **Return Statement:**
   - The function returns the `prediction` (party affiliation) and the `nodes` list representing the truth values of the conditions in the decision tree.

**Example Usage:**

Let's test the function with an example input.

```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,               # 'yes'
    'water project cost sharing': 1,        # 'no'
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1, # 'no'
    'physician fee freeze': 2,              # 'yes'
    'el salvador aid': 2,                   # 'yes'
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

# Get the prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} ({'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'})")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**
```
Prediction: 1 (Republican)
Nodes: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:
- The representative voted 'yes' on **physician fee freeze** (`nodes[0] = 1`).
- Voted 'yes' on **el salvador aid** (`nodes[1] = 1`).
- The function predicts **Republican** (`1`).

**Feature Details and Encodings:**

- **Vote Encoding:**
  - **2**: 'yes'
  - **1**: 'no'

- **Feature Keys and Descriptions:**
  - `'handicapped infants'`: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants.
  - `'water project cost sharing'`: Vote on water project cost sharing.
  - `'adoption of the budget resolution'`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution.
  - `'physician fee freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze.
  - `'el salvador aid'`: Vote on aid to El Salvador.
  - (Other features can be included as necessary.)

**Target Variable:**
- **'party affiliation'**:
  - **1**: Republican
  - **0**: Democrat

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` includes all the feature keys used in the decision tree.
- The function strictly follows the structure of the decision tree provided, with a maximum depth of 5.
- The `nodes` list provides a transparent view of the decisions made at each node:
  - `1` indicates the condition at that node was satisfied.
  - `0` indicates the condition was not satisfied.
- The function can be easily integrated into larger applications where predictions are needed based on these features.

**Conclusion:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier as requested, formatting it to return both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes. It adheres to the specified feature names, encodings, and target variable encoding, and follows the example provided.
