Certainly! Below is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of this list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

### **Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if 'el salvador aid' vote is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['el salvador aid'] == 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 is satisfied, predict Republican (1)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        nodes[1] = 0  # Node 1 is not evaluated, set to 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'physician fee freeze' vote is 'no' (encoded as 1)
        nodes[1] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 1)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 is satisfied, predict Democrat (0)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Republican (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

- **Target Variable:**
  - **party affiliation**: `1` = Republican, `0` = Democrat

- **Nodes Explanation:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the congressperson voted **'yes'** on **'el salvador aid'**.
    - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If **no** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to **Node 1**.
  - **Node 1:** Checks if the congressperson voted **'no'** on **'physician fee freeze'**.
    - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`), predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Truth Values List (`nodes`):**
  - Entries are `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.
  - If a node is not evaluated (because a previous condition was satisfied), its value is set to `0`.

### **Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the results
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 0]
```

### **Explanation of the Example:**

- **Step 1:** Evaluate **Node 0**:
  - `X['el salvador aid'] == 2` (Yes vote)
  - `nodes[0] = 1` (Condition satisfied)
  - Since Node 0 is `1`, predict **Republican**.
  - **Node 1** is not evaluated but set to `0`.

- **Step 2:** The prediction is **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Step 3:** The **nodes** list is `[1, 0]`, indicating:
  - **Node 0** condition is satisfied (`1`).
  - **Node 1** condition is not satisfied or not evaluated (`0`).

### **Function Behavior with Different Inputs:**

- **Case 1:** Voted 'yes' on 'el salvador aid':
  - `nodes[0] = 1`
  - Predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`)

- **Case 2:** Voted 'no' on 'el salvador aid' and 'no' on 'physician fee freeze':
  - `nodes[0] = 0`
  - `nodes[1] = 1`
  - Predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`)

- **Case 3:** Voted 'no' on 'el salvador aid' and 'yes' on 'physician fee freeze':
  - `nodes[0] = 0`
  - `nodes[1] = 0`
  - Predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`)

### **Important Notes:**

- Ensure all feature keys in the input dictionary `X` match exactly with the specified keys, including case sensitivity and spacing.
- All vote values should be encoded as `2` for 'yes' and `1` for 'no'.
- The function will return:
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1` = Republican, `0` = Democrat).
  - `nodes`: A list of `1`s and `0`s representing the truth values of the inner nodes' conditions.

### **Conclusion:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features to classify the party affiliation as either **Democrat** or **Republican**, based on the voting patterns on key issues. The function follows the exact feature keys and encodings provided and is formatted as per your request.
