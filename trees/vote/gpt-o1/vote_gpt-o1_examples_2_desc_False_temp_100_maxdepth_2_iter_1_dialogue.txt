The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` (where keys are feature names with exact spelling) and returns a single prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2  # 2 = yes, 1 = no

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Vote on aid to El Salvador
        nodes[1] = X['el salvador aid'] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 1: Vote on physician fee freeze
        nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition at the root node: whether the vote on the **'adoption of the budget resolution'** was **yes**.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition at the first level, which depends on the outcome of `nodes[0]`:
    - If `nodes[0]` is **True** (voted **yes** on the budget resolution), `nodes[1]` checks the vote on **'el salvador aid'**.
    - If `nodes[0]` is **False** (voted **no** on the budget resolution), `nodes[1]` checks the vote on **'physician fee freeze'**.

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - All votes are encoded with **2** for **yes** and **1** for **no**, as specified.

- **Prediction:**
  - The function returns `prediction`, where **1** represents **Republican** and **0** represents **Democrat**, in line with the target variable encoding.
  - The `nodes` list contains integers **1** for conditions that are satisfied (**True**) and **0** for conditions not satisfied (**False**).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a dictionary `X` representing a voter's positions:

```python
voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voter)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1` means the voter voted **yes** on **'adoption of the budget resolution'**.
  - `nodes[1] = 1` means the voter voted **yes** on **'el salvador aid'**.
  - Based on these votes, the function predicts **Republican**.

This function follows the format of your examples and uses the most informative features to classify the party affiliation based on the voting record.
