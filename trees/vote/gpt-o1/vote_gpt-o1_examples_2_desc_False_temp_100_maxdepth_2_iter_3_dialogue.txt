Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree for classifying party affiliation based on the given features. The function returns the prediction (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 2  # Initialize a list of length 2 for the inner nodes
    # First Split: Vote on physician fee freeze == 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the condition is satisfied, predict Republican (1)
        prediction = 1
        nodes[1] = 0  # Second node is not evaluated
    else:
        # Second Split: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == 'yes'
        nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the condition is satisfied, predict Democrat (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Else, predict Republican (1)
            prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:**
  - We initialize a list `nodes` with 2 elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the evaluation of the first condition.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the evaluation of the second condition.

- **First Condition:**
  - We check if the representative **voted 'yes'** (`2`) on **"physician fee freeze"**.
    ```python
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)
    ```
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition satisfied), we predict **Republican (`1`)**.
  - Since the second condition is not evaluated in this branch, we set `nodes[1] = 0`.

- **Second Condition:**
  - If the first condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] == 0`), we evaluate the second condition.
  - We check if the representative **voted 'yes'** (`2`) on **"adoption of the budget resolution"**.
    ```python
    nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)
    ```
  - If `nodes[1]` is `1` (condition satisfied), we predict **Democrat (`0`)**.
  - Else, we predict **Republican (`1`)**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input: A representative's votes
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

- **Interpretation of Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The representative did **not** vote 'yes' on "physician fee freeze".
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: The representative **voted 'yes'** on "adoption of the budget resolution".

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the exact keys as specified and that the vote values are encoded as `2` for 'yes' and `1` for 'no'.
