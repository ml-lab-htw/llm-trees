```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # We have 3 decision nodes in the tree

    # Node 0: Check 'physician fee freeze' vote
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)  # 2 represents 'Yes'

    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted 'Yes' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Check 'adoption of the budget resolution' vote
        nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)  # 2 represents 'Yes'

        if nodes[1]:
            # If voted 'Yes' on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # Node 2: Check 'el salvador aid' vote
            nodes[2] = int(X["el salvador aid"] == 2)  # 2 represents 'Yes'

            if nodes[2]:
                # If voted 'Yes' on el salvador aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                # Voted 'No' on el salvador aid
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**
  - We initialize a list `nodes` with three elements `[0, 0, 0]` corresponding to the three decision nodes in our tree.
  - Each node will contain `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied (True) and `0` if not (False).

- **Decision Nodes:**
  1. **Node 0:** 
     - Checks if the **'physician fee freeze'** vote is `'Yes'` (`2`).
     - `nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)`
  2. **Node 1:** (Evaluated only if Node 0 condition is not satisfied)
     - Checks if the **'adoption of the budget resolution'** vote is `'Yes'` (`2`).
     - `nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)`
  3. **Node 2:** (Evaluated only if Node 0 and Node 1 conditions are not satisfied)
     - Checks if the **'el salvador aid'** vote is `'Yes'` (`2`).
     - `nodes[2] = int(X["el salvador aid"] == 2)`

- **Prediction:**
  - If **Node 0** condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), then the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
  - If **Node 0** is not satisfied, we check **Node 1**.
    - If **Node 1** condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] == 1`), the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).
    - If **Node 1** is not satisfied, we check **Node 2**.
      - If **Node 2** condition is satisfied (`nodes[2] == 1`), the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
      - If **Node 2** is not satisfied, the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The final predicted class (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
  - `nodes`: A list of `1`s and `0`s representing whether each condition in the nodes is satisfied.

**Example Usage:**

Suppose we have a congressperson with the following voting record:

```python
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}
```

Predicting party affiliation:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Decision Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Decision Nodes: [1, 0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - **Node 0:** `1` (Condition satisfied: Voted 'Yes' on physician fee freeze)
  - **Node 1:** `0` (Not evaluated because Node 0 condition was satisfied)
  - **Node 2:** `0` (Not evaluated because Node 0 condition was satisfied)

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - **Votes:** `2` = Yes, `1` = No

- **Exact Feature Keys (pay attention to spelling and case):**

  ```
  ['handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 'adoption of the budget resolution', 'physician fee freeze', 'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools', 'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras', 'mx missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels corporation cutback', 'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 'crime', 'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa']
  ```

- **Target Variable:**
  - **party affiliation**: `1` = Republican, `0` = Democrat

**Summary:**

- The function `predict` uses the most informative features (votes) to classify the party affiliation.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were evaluated and whether they were satisfied.
- By tracing the `nodes`, you can understand the path taken in the decision tree to arrive at the prediction.
