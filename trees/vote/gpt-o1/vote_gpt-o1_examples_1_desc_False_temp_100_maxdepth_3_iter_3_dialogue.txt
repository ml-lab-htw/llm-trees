Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the specified features and encodings. The function returns a single prediction (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat) and a list representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['physician fee freeze'] == 2 else 0

    # Node 1 and Node 2 are evaluated only if Node 0 condition is not satisfied
    if nodes[0]:
        # If 'physician fee freeze' == 2 ('yes')
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        nodes[1] = None
        nodes[2] = None
    else:
        # If 'physician fee freeze' == 1 ('no')
        # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2 else 0

        if nodes[1]:
            # If 'adoption of the budget resolution' == 2 ('yes')
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            nodes[2] = None
        else:
            # If 'adoption of the budget resolution' == 1 ('no')
            # Node 2: Vote on duty free exports (2 = yes, 1 = no)
            nodes[2] = 1 if X['duty free exports'] == 2 else 0

            if nodes[2]:
                # If 'duty free exports' == 2 ('yes')
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                # If 'duty free exports' == 1 ('no')
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the condition at the root node (Vote on physician fee freeze).
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the condition at the second node (Vote on adoption of the budget resolution). It is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `0`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Represents the truth value of the condition at the third node (Vote on duty free exports). It is only evaluated if both `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are `0`.

- **Conditions:**
  - **Node 0 Condition:**
    - `nodes[0] = 1` if `'physician fee freeze' == 2` (voted "yes").
    - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), the function predicts `1` (Republican), and no further nodes are evaluated.
  - **Node 1 Condition:**
    - Evaluated only if `nodes[0] = 0`.
    - `nodes[1] = 1` if `'adoption of the budget resolution' == 2` (voted "yes").
    - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] = 1`), the function predicts `1` (Republican).
  - **Node 2 Condition:**
    - Evaluated only if `nodes[0] = 0` and `nodes[1] = 0`.
    - `nodes[2] = 1` if `'duty free exports' == 2` (voted "yes").
    - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[2] = 1`), the function predicts `0` (Democrat). Otherwise, it predicts `1` (Republican).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following feature values for a congressperson:

```python
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}
```

We can make a prediction as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: The congressperson voted "no" on the physician fee freeze.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: The congressperson voted "no" on the adoption of the budget resolution.
  - `nodes[2] = 1`: The congressperson voted "yes" on duty free exports.
- **Prediction:** Based on the decision tree, this congressperson is predicted to be a **Democrat**.

**Important Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree provided, using the most significant features for classification.
- Feature names and encodings are used exactly as specified.
- The nodes list provides insight into the path taken in the decision tree to arrive at the prediction.

**Conclusion:**

This function allows you to classify a congressperson's party affiliation based on their votes on key issues. The nodes list provides a transparent view of the decision-making process within the tree, showing which conditions were met during classification.
