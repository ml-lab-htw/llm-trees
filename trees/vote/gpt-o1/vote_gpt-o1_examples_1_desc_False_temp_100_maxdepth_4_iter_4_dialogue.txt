Certainly! Below is the decision tree formatted as a Python function named `predict`. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values (votes on issues) and returns a prediction of the party affiliation (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat) along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

Please ensure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` match exactly with the feature names provided (case-sensitive and space-sensitive).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on 'physician fee freeze' == Yes (2)?
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied, predict Republican
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Vote on 'el salvador aid' == Yes (2)?
        nodes[1] = int(X['el salvador aid'] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied, predict Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Node 2: Vote on 'adoption of the budget resolution' == Yes (2)?
            nodes[2] = int(X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Node 2 condition is satisfied, predict Republican
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                # Node 3: Vote on 'education spending' == Yes (2)?
                nodes[3] = int(X['education spending'] == 2)
                if nodes[3]:
                    # If Node 3 condition is satisfied, predict Democrat
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    # If Node 3 condition is not satisfied, predict Democrat
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # For nodes that were not evaluated (due to earlier decisions), set their values to None
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        nodes[1], nodes[2], nodes[3] = None, None, None
    elif nodes[1] == 1:
        nodes[2], nodes[3] = None, None
    elif nodes[2] == 1:
        nodes[3] = None

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list captures the truth values of the conditions at each node in the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition at the root node:
    - `1` if the vote on 'physician fee freeze' is **Yes** (`2`).
    - `0` if the vote is **No** (`1`).
  - The subsequent nodes (`nodes[1]`, `nodes[2]`, `nodes[3]`) follow similarly for the other conditions.
- **Prediction:**
  - If any of the conditions leading to a Republican classification are satisfied (i.e., any of `nodes[0]`, `nodes[1]`, or `nodes[2]` is `1`), the prediction is `1` (Republican).
  - If none of these conditions are satisfied and we reach `nodes[3]`, the prediction depends on the vote on 'education spending':
    - `1` (Republican) if the condition is not satisfied.
    - `0` (Democrat) if the condition is satisfied.
- **Unused Nodes:** Nodes that are not evaluated due to earlier decisions in the tree are set to `None` in the `nodes` list.
- **Feature Keys:** Ensure that the keys in `X` match exactly with the feature names, including spaces and capitalization:
  - `'physician fee freeze'`
  - `'el salvador aid'`
  - `'adoption of the budget resolution'`
  - `'education spending'`

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where the person voted 'No' on all issues
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0 (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)
Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encoding:** Remember that for all votes:
  - **Yes** votes are encoded as `2`.
  - **No** votes are encoded as `1`.
- **Target Encoding:**
  - `1` represents **Republican**.
  - `0` represents **Democrat**.
- **Function Behavior:** The function strictly follows the decision tree logic provided, with a maximum depth of 4.

**Testing the Function:**

You can test the function with various inputs to simulate different voting patterns and verify that the predictions align with the decision tree.

**Sample Test Cases:**

1. **Voted 'Yes' on 'physician fee freeze':**

   ```python
   X_test = {
       'physician fee freeze': 2,
       # Other features can be any value since they won't affect the prediction
   }

   prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Should be 1 (Republican)
   print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Nodes[0] should be 1
   ```

2. **Voted 'No' on 'physician fee freeze', 'Yes' on 'el salvador aid':**

   ```python
   X_test = {
       'physician fee freeze': 1,
       'el salvador aid': 2,
   }

   prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Should be 1 (Republican)
   print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Nodes[0] is 0, Nodes[1] is 1
   ```

3. **Voted 'No' on first three issues, 'Yes' on 'education spending':**

   ```python
   X_test = {
       'physician fee freeze': 1,
       'el salvador aid': 1,
       'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
       'education spending': 2,
   }

   prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Should be 0 (Democrat)
   print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Nodes[0], Nodes[1], Nodes[2] are 0, Nodes[3] is 1
   ```

**Conclusion:**

This function provides a programmatic way to predict party affiliation based on voting records using the decision tree you specified. By returning both the prediction and the list of node truth values, you can trace the path taken through the tree for any given input.

Feel free to adjust the function or add additional test cases to suit your needs.
