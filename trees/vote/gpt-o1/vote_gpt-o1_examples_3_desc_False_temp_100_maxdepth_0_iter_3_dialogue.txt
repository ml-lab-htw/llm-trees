Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each node in the list is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize list to hold truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'physician fee freeze' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)

    # Node 1: Check if 'education spending' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[1] = int(X["education spending"] == 2)

    # Node 2: Check if 'el salvador aid' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[2] = int(X["el salvador aid"] == 2)

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If voted 'yes' on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If voted 'yes' on el salvador aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                # Voted 'no' on all conditions
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**

  - `'physician fee freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes / 1 = no)
  - `'education spending'`: Vote on education spending (2 = yes / 1 = no)
  - `'el salvador aid'`: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes / 1 = no)

- **Target Variable:**

  - `party affiliation`: (1 = Republican / 0 = Democrat)

- **Decision Logic:**

  1. **Node 0:** Check if the congressperson voted 'yes' on the physician fee freeze.
     - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
     - If **no** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to Node 1.
  2. **Node 1:** Check if they voted 'yes' on education spending.
     - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`), proceed to Node 2.
  3. **Node 2:** Check if they voted 'yes' on aid to El Salvador.
     - If **yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`), predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
     - If **no** (`nodes[2] = 0`), predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

**Notes:**

- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the exact feature keys as specified.
- The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1` = Republican, `0` = Democrat).
  - `nodes`: The list of truth values for the inner nodes.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): 1
Nodes Truth Values: [1, 1, 0]
```

**Explanation of Sample Output:**

- `nodes[0] = 1` because `"physician fee freeze" == 2` (voted 'yes').
- Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, the prediction is `1` (Republican), and the conditions in Nodes 1 and 2 are not used for the prediction.
- The truth values of Nodes 1 and 2 are still calculated and included in the `nodes` list.

**Note:** This decision tree uses the most significant features to classify the party affiliation based on voting records. The thresholds and conditions are based on the importance of the features in splitting the data effectively.
