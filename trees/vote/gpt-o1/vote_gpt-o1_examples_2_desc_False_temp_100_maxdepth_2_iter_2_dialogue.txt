Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree as per your specifications. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, and it returns a single prediction (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat) along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes (with `1` indicating the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2

    # Node 1: Check if the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[1] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied (voted 'Yes' on physician fee freeze)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied (voted 'Yes' on adoption of the budget resolution)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # If neither condition is satisfied
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Convert boolean conditions to integers (1 or 0)
    nodes = [int(n) for n in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features and Encodings:**
  - `'physician fee freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'adoption of the budget resolution'`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - Target variable: `party affiliation` (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)

- **Decision Tree Logic:**

  1. **Node 0:** Check if the representative voted 'Yes' on the physician fee freeze.
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[0]` is `1`):
       - **Prediction:** Republican (`1`)
     - If **No** (`nodes[0]` is `0`):
       2. **Node 1:** Check if they voted 'Yes' on the adoption of the budget resolution.
          - If **Yes** (`nodes[1]` is `1`):
            - **Prediction:** Republican (`1`)
          - If **No** (`nodes[1]` is `0`):
            - **Prediction:** Democrat (`0`)

- **Function Details:**

  - The function initializes a list `nodes` with two `None` values to represent the inner nodes of the tree.
  - It then evaluates the conditions for each node and stores the boolean results.
  - The boolean results are converted to integers (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`) to comply with the required format.
  - Finally, the function returns the prediction and the list of node truth values.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where a representative voted 'Yes' on physician fee freeze and 'No' on budget resolution
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 0]
```

In this example:

- The representative voted 'Yes' on **physician fee freeze**, so `nodes[0]` is `1`.
- Since the first condition is satisfied, the prediction is `Republican`, and there is no need to evaluate the second node for the prediction.
- However, `nodes[1]` still records the truth value of the second condition for completeness.
