Certainly! Below is the Python function representing the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns the predicted party affiliation along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Initialize a list for one node

    # Node 0: Check if the vote on 'physician fee freeze' is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Used:** `"physician fee freeze"`
- **Condition:** `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2` (where `2` represents a 'yes' vote)
- **Nodes List:** `nodes[0]` is set to `1` if the condition is `True` (condition satisfied), else `0`.

### How the Function Works:

1. **Input:**
   - `X`: A dictionary containing the features. For example:
     ```python
     X = {
         'handicapped infants': 1,
         'water project cost sharing': 2,
         'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
         'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Example value
         # ... other features
     }
     ```

2. **Node Evaluation:**
   - **Node 0:** Checks if the congressperson voted 'yes' on the 'physician fee freeze' issue.
     - `nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)`
     - If the vote is 'yes' (2), `nodes[0]` becomes `1`.
     - If the vote is 'no' (1), `nodes[0]` becomes `0`.

3. **Prediction:**
   - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition satisfied):
     - `prediction = 1` (Republican)
   - Else:
     - `prediction = 0` (Democrat)

4. **Return:**
   - The function returns the `prediction` and the list `nodes`.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input where the congressperson voted 'yes' on 'physician fee freeze'
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1]
```

### Notes:

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - Votes are encoded as:
    - `2` for 'yes'
    - `1` for 'no'
- **Target Encoding:**
  - `1` for Republican
  - `0` for Democrat

- **Assumptions:**
  - All feature keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the provided feature names.
  - The input dictionary `X` contains all the required features.

### Summary:

The function uses the most informative feature—**the vote on the 'physician fee freeze'**—to predict the party affiliation. This feature effectively splits the dataset because:

- **Republicans** predominantly voted **'yes'** (`2`).
- **Democrats** predominantly voted **'no'** (`1`).

By checking this single feature, the decision tree can classify the party affiliation with a significant level of accuracy.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs to see how it predicts the party affiliation based on the voting record.
