Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree to predict party affiliation based on the specified votes. The function returns the prediction (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in the `nodes` list is `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # We have 3 inner nodes in the decision tree

    # Node 0: Did the congressperson vote 'No' on 'physician fee freeze'?
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["physician fee freeze"] == 1 else 0  # 1 = No, 2 = Yes

    if nodes[0]:
        # If 'Yes' to Node 0 condition (voted 'No' on 'physician fee freeze')
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 1: Did the congressperson vote 'No' on 'adoption of the budget resolution'?
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1 else 0

        if nodes[1]:
            # If 'Yes' to Node 1 condition (voted 'No' on 'adoption of the budget resolution')
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # Node 2: Did the congressperson vote 'No' on 'aid to nicaraguan contras'?
            nodes[2] = 1 if X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1 else 0

            if nodes[2]:
                # If 'Yes' to Node 2 condition (voted 'No' on 'aid to nicaraguan contras')
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                # If 'No' to all conditions, predict Republican
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Votes are encoded as:
    - `1` = No
    - `2` = Yes
- **Target Variable:**
  - `party affiliation`: `0` = Democrat, `1` = Republican

**Nodes and Conditions:**

1. **Node 0:** 
   - Condition: `X["physician fee freeze"] == 1` (Voted 'No' on physician fee freeze)
   - If `True` (`nodes[0] = 1`), predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`)
   - If `False` (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to Node 1
2. **Node 1:** 
   - Condition: `X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1` (Voted 'No' on adoption of the budget resolution)
   - If `True` (`nodes[1] = 1`), predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`)
   - If `False` (`nodes[1] = 0`), proceed to Node 2
3. **Node 2:** 
   - Condition: `X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1` (Voted 'No' on aid to Nicaraguan contras)
   - If `True` (`nodes[2] = 1`), predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`)
   - If `False` (`nodes[2] = 0`), predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,  # Voted 'No'
    'physician fee freeze': 2,               # Voted 'Yes'
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

# Get the prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Map prediction to party affiliation
party = 'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'

# Output the results
print(f"Prediction: {party}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0, 1, None]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **`nodes[0] = 0`**: The congressperson did **not** vote 'No' on 'physician fee freeze' (they voted 'Yes').
- **`nodes[1] = 1`**: They voted 'No' on 'adoption of the budget resolution'.
- **`nodes[2] = None`**: Node 2 was not evaluated because the prediction was made at Node 1.
- **`prediction = 0`**: The model predicts that the congressperson is a **Democrat**.

**Function Flow:**

1. **Check Node 0 Condition:**
   - `nodes[0] = 1` if voted 'No' on 'physician fee freeze'.
   - In the example, `X["physician fee freeze"] = 2` (voted 'Yes'), so `nodes[0] = 0`.
2. **Since `nodes[0] = 0`, check Node 1 Condition:**
   - `nodes[1] = 1` if voted 'No' on 'adoption of the budget resolution'.
   - `X["adoption of the budget resolution"] = 1` (voted 'No'), so `nodes[1] = 1`.
3. **Since `nodes[1] = 1`, predict Democrat:**
   - `prediction = 0` (Democrat)
4. **Node 2 is not evaluated:**
   - `nodes[2]` remains `None` because a prediction was already made.

**Important Notes:**

- **Feature Names:** The keys in the input dictionary `X` must match exactly with the feature names provided. Pay close attention to spelling, spaces, and case sensitivity.
- **Encoding:** Ensure that the vote values are correctly encoded as `1` for 'No' and `2` for 'Yes'.
- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
  - `None` if the node was not evaluated.

**Extending the Function:**

If you have more data or wish to expand the decision tree with additional nodes and conditions, you can extend the `nodes` list and add more `if-else` statements following the same structure.

This function follows your instructions, providing a clear implementation of the decision tree based on the given features and target variable encodings. It should accurately classify the party affiliation based on the votes on key issues.
