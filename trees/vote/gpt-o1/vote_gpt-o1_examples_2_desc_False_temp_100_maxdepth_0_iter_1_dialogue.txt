**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize the list to hold truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'physician fee freeze' vote is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 2)

    # Node 1: Check if 'adoption of the budget resolution' vote is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[1] = int(X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2)

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Party affiliation: Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If Node 1 condition is satisfied
            prediction = 1  # Party affiliation: Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Party affiliation: Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'physician fee freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = Yes, 1 = No)
  - `'adoption of the budget resolution'`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = Yes, 1 = No)

- **Node Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the congressperson voted **'Yes'** on **'physician fee freeze'**.
    - `nodes[0] = 1` if **Yes** (vote encoded as `2`), else `nodes[0] = 0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the congressperson voted **'Yes'** on **'adoption of the budget resolution'**.
    - `nodes[1] = 1` if **Yes** (vote encoded as `2`), else `nodes[1] = 0`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0] == 1` (voted **'Yes'** on physician fee freeze):
    - **Prediction**: `0` (Democrat)
  - **Else**, **if** `nodes[1] == 1` (voted **'Yes'** on adoption of the budget resolution):
    - **Prediction**: `1` (Republican)
  - **Else**:
    - **Prediction**: `0` (Democrat)

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation.
    - `0` = Democrat
    - `1` = Republican
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    - Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input dictionary representing a congressperson's votes
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

# Predict party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Predicted Party Affiliation: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Party Affiliation: Republican
Node Truth Values: [0, 1]
```

In this example:

- **Node 0** evaluates to `0` because `'physician fee freeze'` vote is `'No'` (encoded as `1`).
- **Node 1** evaluates to `1` because `'adoption of the budget resolution'` vote is `'Yes'` (encoded as `2`).
- The model predicts **Republican** based on the decision tree logic.
