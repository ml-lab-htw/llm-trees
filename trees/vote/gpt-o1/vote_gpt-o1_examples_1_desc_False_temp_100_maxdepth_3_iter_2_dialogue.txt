Sure! Based on the decision tree provided and the exact feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list of 3 elements
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["physician fee freeze"] == 2 else 0  # Node 0 condition
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["synfuels corporation cutback"] == 2 else 0  # Node 1 condition
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2 else 0  # Node 2 condition

    if nodes[0]:  # If Vote on physician fee freeze is Yes
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If Vote on synfuels corporation cutback is Yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If Vote on adoption of the budget resolution is Yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the first split in the tree:
  - Checks if the "physician fee freeze" vote is `Yes` (encoded as `2`).
- **nodes[1]** corresponds to the second split if the first condition is not met:
  - Checks if the "synfuels corporation cutback" vote is `Yes` (encoded as `2`).
- **nodes[2]** corresponds to the third split if the second condition is not met:
  - Checks if the "adoption of the budget resolution" vote is `Yes` (encoded as `2`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where a congressperson voted 'Yes' (2) for 'physician fee freeze'
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- The congressperson voted `Yes` on "physician fee freeze", so `nodes[0] = 1`.
- Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, the prediction is `Republican`.

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the feature keys exactly as specified, with values encoded as `2` for `Yes` and `1` for `No`.
