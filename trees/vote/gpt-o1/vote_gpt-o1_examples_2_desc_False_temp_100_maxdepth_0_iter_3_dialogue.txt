Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the provided voting features. The function returns the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes, where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze == 'yes' (2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)

    # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == 'yes' (2)
    nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted 'yes' on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted 'no' on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Voted 'no' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):** A list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each element is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the vote on **physician fee freeze** is 'yes' (encoded as `2`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the vote on **adoption of the budget resolution** is 'yes' (encoded as `2`).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze):
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is `1` (voted 'yes' on adoption of the budget resolution):
      - **Prediction:** `1` (Republican)
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Democrat)
  - **Else:** (voted 'no' on physician fee freeze)
    - **Prediction:** `1` (Republican)

**How to Use the Function:**

Provide a dictionary `X` containing the voting record of a congressperson. The keys should match exactly as specified, including spaces and lowercase letters. The votes should be encoded as `2` for 'yes' and `1` for 'no'.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input for a congressperson
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Get the prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
party = 'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'
print(f"Prediction: {party}")
print(f"Inner Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Inner Nodes: [1, 1]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - All votes are encoded as:
    - `2` = 'yes'
    - `1` = 'no'
- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `1` = Republican
  - `0` = Democrat
- **Feature Names:**
  - Must match exactly as specified. For example:
    - `'physician fee freeze'`
    - `'adoption of the budget resolution'`

**Important:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with correctly encoded values.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree provided, utilizing the most significant features for classification.
- The truth values in `nodes` correspond to the conditions checked:
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first condition (node) in the tree.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second condition (node) in the tree.

By using this function, you can classify the party affiliation of a congressperson based on their votes with a simple and interpretable model.
