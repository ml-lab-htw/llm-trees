            prediction = 1 # Republican (possible, less certain in this hypothetical scenario)
    else:  # Voted NO on physician fee freeze

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Hypothetical Features:** As emphasized earlier, without real data, the selection of "physician fee freeze" and "aid to nicaraguan contras" as the most important features is purely hypothetical and for illustrative purposes.  The actual important features would depend on the dataset.

2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds here are based on the voting outcome (yes/no), represented as 1 and 0, respectively, as you specified.

3. **Encoding:**  The code uses the specified encoding (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).

4. **Real-World Application:** To apply this to real-world data, you would need a labeled dataset of voting records and party affiliations. You would train a decision tree algorithm (e.g., using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn) on this data. The algorithm would learn the actual important features and thresholds automatically. You could then extract the learned tree structure and implement a prediction function similar to the one above, but using the learned features and thresholds.

5. **Depth 2 Enforcement:** The provided function adheres to the depth-2 constraint.  There are two levels of decision-making based on the two selected features.

6. **`nodes` List:**  The `nodes` list correctly tracks the truth values of the conditions at each inner node (1 if the condition is true, 0 if false). This is useful for understanding the path taken by the decision tree during prediction.


Provide a dataset, and I can demonstrate how to build a real decision tree and a corresponding prediction function.
