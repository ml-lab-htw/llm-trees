Certainly! Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree we discussed, formatted as per your instructions. This function will return a single prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

```python
def predict(X):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to hold truth values for the 3 inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'physician fee freeze' vote is 'yes' (value == 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied (voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'adoption of the budget resolution' vote is 'yes'
        nodes[1] = int(X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2)

        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied (voted 'yes' on adoption of the budget resolution)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if 'aid to nicaraguan contras' vote is 'yes'
            nodes[2] = int(X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2)

            if nodes[2]:
                # If Node 2 condition is satisfied (voted 'yes' on aid to Nicaraguan contras)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                # If none of the above conditions are satisfied
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the vote on 'physician fee freeze' is 'yes' (encoded as `2`).
  - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), predicts **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If **no** (`nodes[0] = 0`), moves to the next node.
- **Node 1:** Checks if the vote on 'adoption of the budget resolution' is 'yes'.
  - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), predicts **Republican**.
  - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`), moves to the next node.
- **Node 2:** Checks if the vote on 'aid to nicaraguan contras' is 'yes'.
  - If **yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`), predicts **Republican**.
  - If **no** (`nodes[2] = 0`), predicts **Democrat**.

**Example Usage:**

Suppose we have a voter with the following voting records:

```python
voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}
```

Predict the party affiliation:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(voter)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, None, None]
```

- Here, `nodes[0] = 1` indicates that the voter voted 'yes' on the 'physician fee freeze', satisfying the first condition and predicting 'Republican' without needing to evaluate further nodes.

**Note on Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- Make sure to use the exact keys provided for the features when using the function.
- All votes are encoded as:
  - `2` for **Yes**
  - `1` for **No**

**Tips:**

- The function assumes that all required keys are present in the input dictionary `X`.
- If any votes are missing or have different encodings, ensure to handle them accordingly before using the function.

**Full Feature List with Encodings for Reference:**

- `'handicapped infants'`: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'water project cost sharing'`: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'adoption of the budget resolution'`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'physician fee freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'el salvador aid'`: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'religious groups in schools'`: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'anti satellite test ban'`: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'aid to nicaraguan contras'`: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'mx missile'`: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'immigration'`: Vote on immigration (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'synfuels corporation cutback'`: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'education spending'`: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'superfund right to sue'`: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'crime'`: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'duty free exports'`: Vote on duty free exports (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- `'export administration act south africa'`: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes, 1 = no)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `'party affiliation'`: (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)

Feel free to use this function in your code, and ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary keys with the correct encodings.
