Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict` that represents the decision tree classifier for predicting a congressperson's party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on their voting record. The function returns a single prediction (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in `nodes` is `1` if the corresponding condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes
    nodes = [None] * 4

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze == yes (2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)
    
    # Node 1: Vote on MX missile == yes (2)
    nodes[1] = int(X["mx missile"] == 2)
    
    # Node 2: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == yes (2)
    nodes[2] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)
    
    # Node 3: Vote on duty free exports == yes (2)
    nodes[3] = int(X["duty free exports"] == 2)

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted "yes" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted "yes" on MX missile
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted "no" on MX missile
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Voted "no" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # If voted "yes" on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Voted "no" on adoption of the budget resolution
            if nodes[3]:  # If voted "yes" on duty free exports
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Voted "no" on duty free exports
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the congressperson voted "yes" (`2`) on **physician fee freeze**.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if they voted "yes" (`2`) on **MX missile**.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if they voted "yes" (`2`) on **adoption of the budget resolution**.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if they voted "yes" (`2`) on **duty free exports**.

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  - **Node 0 (physician fee freeze):**
    - If `nodes[0] == 1` (voted "yes"), the congressperson is likely a **Republican**. This is because most Republicans supported the physician fee freeze.
    - **Node 1 (MX missile):**
      - Although in the original decision tree both branches under this node lead to **Republican**, we include it in the `nodes` list for completeness.
  - **Else** (voted "no" on physician fee freeze):
    - **Node 2 (adoption of the budget resolution):**
      - If `nodes[2] == 1` (voted "yes"), the congressperson is likely a **Democrat**.
    - **Else** (voted "no" on adoption of the budget resolution):
      - **Node 3 (duty free exports):**
        - If `nodes[3] == 1` (voted "yes"), the congressperson is likely a **Democrat**.
        - **Else** (voted "no" on duty free exports), the congressperson is classified as **Republican**.

**Example Usage:**

Let's test the function with an example input:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,  # Voted "yes"
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,  # Voted "yes"
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the result
party = "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat"
print(f"Predicted Party: {party}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Party: Republican
Nodes: [1, 1, 0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 1`: The congressperson voted "yes" on **physician fee freeze**.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: They voted "yes" on **MX missile**.
- Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, the prediction is **Republican** regardless of the values of the subsequent nodes.

**Notes:**

- The entries in the `nodes` list correspond to the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` means the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` means the condition is not satisfied.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree and uses the specified feature encodings.
- All feature keys are used as provided, with exact spelling and casing.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**
