```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # Aid to Contras: 2 = Yes
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2       # Physician Fee Freeze: 2 = Yes

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that 'yes' votes are encoded as 2, and 'no' votes are encoded as 1.  The code now correctly reflects this encoding.

2. **Clarity:** The code is now more readable and clearly shows the decision logic based on the two selected features.

3. **Boolean Conversion:** The conditions in the `if` statements are now directly evaluating boolean values (True/False), which makes the logic more straightforward.

4. **No Thresholds Needed:** For categorical features like these votes, we don't need arbitrary thresholds.  We directly check if the vote was 'yes' (encoded as 2).

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [False, False]


example_voter2 = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    # ... (other features)
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,  # Voted 'yes' on Contras aid
    # ... (other features)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [True, ...] (Second node irrelevant)

```


This improved function accurately implements the hypothetical decision tree logic based on the provided feature encoding and returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values. Remember that this tree is still just a hypothetical example and would need to be trained on real data for accurate predictions.
