Certainly! Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier based on the given features and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    # Node 0: Check if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician fee freeze'] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features and Encodings:**
  - `'physician fee freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **Decision Rule:**
  - **Node 0** checks if the value of `'physician fee freeze'` in the input `X` is `2` (which means 'Yes').
    - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), proceed to predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If **No** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes` is a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    - `nodes[0]` is **1** if the condition (`'physician fee freeze'` == 2) is satisfied.
    - `nodes[0]` is **0** if the condition is not satisfied.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the vote on physician fee freeze is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1]
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the correct encodings.
- The function strictly relies on the `'physician fee freeze'` feature to make the prediction.
- The `nodes` list can be used to trace which conditions were met during prediction.

This function adheres to the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, using the most significant feature to classify the party affiliation.
