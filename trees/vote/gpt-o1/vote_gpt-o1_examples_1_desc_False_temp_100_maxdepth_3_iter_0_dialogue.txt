The entries in the `nodes` list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if 'physician fee freeze' vote is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician fee freeze"] == 2)
    
    # Node 1: Check if 'adoption of the budget resolution' vote is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[1] = int(X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2)
    
    # Node 2: Check if 'crime' vote is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[2] = int(X["crime"] == 2)
    
    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 0 condition is not satisfied
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 1 condition is satisfied
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # Node 1 condition is not satisfied
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 2 condition is satisfied
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                # Node 2 condition is not satisfied
                prediction = 1  # Republican
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys and Encoding:**
  - `"physician fee freeze"`: Vote on physician fee freeze (encoded as `2` for 'Yes' and `1` for 'No')
  - `"adoption of the budget resolution"`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (encoded as `2` for 'Yes' and `1` for 'No')
  - `"crime"`: Vote on crime (encoded as `2` for 'Yes' and `1` for 'No')

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates to `1` if the condition `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2` is satisfied, else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates to `1` if the condition `X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2` is satisfied, else `0`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Evaluates to `1` if the condition `X["crime"] == 2` is satisfied, else `0`.

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  - **Node 0**: If the vote on physician fee freeze is 'Yes' (`nodes[0] == 1`), predict `1` (Republican).
  - **Node 1**: If `nodes[0] == 0` and the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'Yes' (`nodes[1] == 1`), predict `0` (Democrat).
  - **Node 2**: If `nodes[0] == 0`, `nodes[1] == 0`, and the vote on crime is 'Yes' (`nodes[2] == 1`), predict `0` (Democrat).
  - **Else**: If none of the above conditions are satisfied, predict `1` (Republican).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input where a congressperson voted 'No' on "physician fee freeze", 'No' on "adoption of the budget resolution", and 'Yes' on "crime":

```python
# Sample input
X = {
    "physician fee freeze": 1,          # No
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,  # No
    "crime": 2                          # Yes
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat):", prediction)
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): 0
Nodes truth values: [0, 0, 1]
```

In this example:
- `nodes[0] = 0` because "physician fee freeze" is 'No'.
- `nodes[1] = 0` because "adoption of the budget resolution" is 'No'.
- `nodes[2] = 1` because "crime" is 'Yes'.
- The prediction is `0` (Democrat) based on the decision tree logic.
