Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that predicts the party affiliation and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (encoded as 1)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['physician fee freeze'] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied (voted 'no'), classify as Democrat
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2 else 0

        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied (voted 'yes'), classify as Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # If Node 1 condition is not satisfied, classify as Democrat
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Represents the condition `X['physician fee freeze'] == 1` (voted 'no').
  - If this condition is **True** (`1`), it means the congressperson voted 'no' on the physician fee freeze.
  - If **True**, classify as **Democrat**.
- **nodes[1]:** Represents the condition `X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2` (voted 'yes').
  - This node is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is **False** (`0`), meaning the congressperson voted 'yes' on the physician fee freeze.
  - If this condition is **True** (`1`), classify as **Republican**.
  - If **False** (`0`), classify as **Democrat**.

**Feature Encodings:**

- **Votes:**
  - `1` = 'no'
  - `2` = 'yes'
- **Party Affiliation:**
  - `0` = Democrat
  - `1` = Republican

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'physician fee freeze': 1,  # Voted 'no'
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2  # Voted 'yes' (this value won't affect the outcome in this case)
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Node Truth Values: [1, None]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] = 1` because `X['physician fee freeze'] == 1`.
- Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, the prediction is **Democrat**, and `nodes[1]` remains `None` because it was not evaluated.

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with correct encodings as specified.
