Certainly! Based on the features and target variable you've provided, I'll construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features to classify party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat). Then, I'll format this decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, following the examples you've given.

---

**Features:**

1. **handicapped infants**: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes / 1 = no)
2. **water project cost sharing**: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes / 1 = no)
3. **adoption of the budget resolution**: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes / 1 = no)
4. **physician fee freeze**: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes / 1 = no)
5. **el salvador aid**: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes / 1 = no)
6. **religious groups in schools**: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes / 1 = no)
7. **anti satellite test ban**: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes / 1 = no)
8. **aid to nicaraguan contras**: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes / 1 = no)
9. **mx missile**: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes / 1 = no)
10. **immigration**: Vote on immigration (2 = yes / 1 = no)
11. **synfuels corporation cutback**: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes / 1 = no)
12. **education spending**: Vote on education spending (2 = yes / 1 = no)
13. **superfund right to sue**: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes / 1 = no)
14. **crime**: Vote on crime (2 = yes / 1 = no)
15. **duty free exports**: Vote on duty-free exports (2 = yes / 1 = no)
16. **export administration act south africa**: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes / 1 = no)

**Target Variable:**

- **party affiliation**: (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)

**Decision Tree Construction:**

Based on analysis of the Congressional Voting Records dataset, certain votes are strong predictors of party affiliation. Two of the most significant features are:

1. **physician fee freeze**
2. **el salvador aid**

Republicans and Democrats tended to vote differently on these issues:

- **Physician Fee Freeze:**
  - Republicans: **Yes** (2)
  - Democrats: **No** (1)

- **El Salvador Aid:**
  - Republicans: **Yes** (2)
  - Democrats: **No** (1)

**Decision Tree Structure:**

```
|--- physician fee freeze == 2 (Yes)
|    |--- class: Republican (1)
|--- physician fee freeze == 1 (No)
|    |--- el salvador aid == 1 (No)
|    |    |--- class: Democrat (0)
|    |--- el salvador aid == 2 (Yes)
|    |    |--- class: Republican (1)
```

**Python Function:**

Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: physician fee freeze == 2 (Yes)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["physician fee freeze"] == 2 else 0
    
    # Node 1: el salvador aid == 1 (No)
    # This node is only evaluated if nodes[0] == 0
    if nodes[0] == 0:
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["el salvador aid"] == 1 else 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Not evaluated
    
    # Decision Rules
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the vote on **"physician fee freeze"** is **Yes** (2).
  - If **Yes** (nodes[0] == 1), predict **Republican** (1).
  - If **No** (nodes[0] == 0), proceed to **Node 1**.

- **Node 1:** Checks if the vote on **"el salvador aid"** is **No** (1).
  - If **No** (nodes[1] == 1), predict **Democrat** (0).
  - If **Yes** (nodes[1] == 0), predict **Republican** (1).

- **The `nodes` List:**
  - `nodes[0]` represents the truth value of the condition at Node 0.
  - `nodes[1]` represents the truth value of the condition at Node 1.
  - Unused nodes are set to `None`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,         # Voted No
    "el salvador aid": 1,              # Voted No
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat):", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat): 0
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

In this example:

- **Node 0:** `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2` ➔ `1 == 2` ➔ `False` ➔ `nodes[0] = 0`
- **Node 1:** `X["el salvador aid"] == 1` ➔ `1 == 1` ➔ `True` ➔ `nodes[1] = 1`
- **Prediction:** Since `nodes[0] == 0` and `nodes[1] == 1`, we predict **Democrat** (0).

**Notes:**

- **Thresholds and Values:** Since the features are categorical with known encodings (2 = Yes, 1 = No), the thresholds are set accordingly.
- **Spelling and Feature Names:** Feature names are used exactly as provided, paying close attention to spelling and casing.
- **Node Truth Values:**
  - The list `nodes` contains `1` if the node's condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
  - For nodes not evaluated (due to the tree's structure), we assign `None`.

---

**Conclusion:**

This function follows the format specified in your examples and uses the features provided to classify the party affiliation based on a decision tree of maximum depth 2. The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
