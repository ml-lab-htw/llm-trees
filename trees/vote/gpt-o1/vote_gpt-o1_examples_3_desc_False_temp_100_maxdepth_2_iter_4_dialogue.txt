Certainly! Based on the given decision tree and feature encodings, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    # Node 0: Check if 'physician fee freeze' vote is Yes (2)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["physician fee freeze"] == 2 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted Yes on 'physician fee freeze', predict Republican (1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'el salvador aid' vote is Yes (2)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["el salvador aid"] == 2 else 0
        if nodes[1]:
            # If voted Yes on 'el salvador aid', predict Republican (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Democrat (0)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Votes are encoded as:
    - **2**: Yes
    - **1**: No
- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - **1**: Republican
  - **0**: Democrat

**Function Details:**

- **Input:**
  - `X`: A dictionary containing the features with their corresponding values. The keys must exactly match the provided feature names.

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the result of the first decision node (root).
    - It checks if the congressperson voted **Yes** (`2`) on **'physician fee freeze'**.
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the result of the second decision node.
    - It checks if the congressperson voted **Yes** (`2`) on **'el salvador aid'**.
  - Each entry is **1** if the condition is satisfied and **0** otherwise.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Node (Root):**
     - If `nodes[0]` is **1** (voted Yes on 'physician fee freeze'):
       - **Predict**: Republican (`1`).
     - Else:
       - Proceed to check the second feature.
  2. **Second Node:**
     - If `nodes[1]` is **1** (voted Yes on 'el salvador aid'):
       - **Predict**: Republican (`1`).
     - Else:
       - **Predict**: Democrat (`0`).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input features for a congressperson
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,          # Voted Yes
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, None]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `Nodes: [1, None]` indicates that the first node's condition was satisfied (voted Yes on 'physician fee freeze'), so the second node wasn't evaluated (`None`).
  - The model predicts that the congressperson is a **Republican**.

**Note:** Ensure that all feature names and their values in the input dictionary `X` match exactly with the specified feature names and encodings.
