Here is the Python function implementation for the decision tree classifier based on the given features and target variable encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree-based classification for party affiliation (Republican or Democrat).
    
    Inputs:
    - X (dict): A dictionary of features with the exact keys provided in the input.

    Outputs:
    - prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
    - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) representing if each condition (inner node) is satisfied.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # True if voted No (Democrat-leaning)
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1       # True if voted No (Democrat-leaning)
    nodes[2] = X["crime"] == 2                 # True if voted Yes (Republican-leaning)
    nodes[3] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 1   # True if voted No (Republican-leaning)
    nodes[4] = X["mx missile"] == 2            # True if voted Yes (Republican-leaning)

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # "physician fee freeze" == No
        if nodes[1]:  # "el salvador aid" == No
            if nodes[2]:  # "crime" == Yes
                if nodes[3]:  # "anti satellite test ban" == No
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "el salvador aid" == Yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # "physician fee freeze" == Yes
        if nodes[4]:  # "mx missile" == Yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input:** The function takes in `X`, a dictionary where the keys are the exact feature names provided, and their values represent the votes for each feature.
2. **`nodes` List:** A list of 5 elements, where each element stores the result (1 or 0) of a condition at each decision node.
    - `1` means the condition is satisfied.
    - `0` means the condition is not satisfied.
3. **Decision Tree Structure:**
    - The `if-else` structure encodes the decision logic described in the previous answer.
    - The decisions use meaningful thresholds (e.g., `== 1` for "No" votes and `== 2` for "Yes" votes) based on the encoding of the features.
4. **Output:**
    - `prediction`: Integer value indicating the predicted class (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
    - `nodes`: The truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example feature input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat):", prediction)
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the given input `X`, the output could be:
```
Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat): 0
Truth values of inner nodes: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
