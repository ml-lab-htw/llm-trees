Here is the Python function for the decision tree you described, formatted to make a prediction and return the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the decision tree.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied) for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize the truth values for the decision tree nodes.
    
    # Node 0: Check the "physician fee freeze" feature.
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Condition: "physician fee freeze" == no (1 = no).
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If "physician fee freeze" == no
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If "physician fee freeze" == yes
        # Node 1: Check the "el salvador aid" feature.
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # Condition: "el salvador aid" == yes (2 = yes).
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If "el salvador aid" == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If "el salvador aid" == no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Suppose we have the following feature values for a representative:
```python
features = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,  # no
    "el salvador aid": 2,  # yes
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
If the feature values are as above:
- "physician fee freeze" == 1 (no), so `nodes[0] = True` (1).
- The prediction is `Democrat` (0), and the second node is not evaluated (`nodes[1] = None`).

Output:
```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [1, None]
```

If the feature values are changed such that `"physician fee freeze": 2` (yes) and `"el salvador aid": 2` (yes), the output would be:
```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

This function is consistent with the decision tree structure and uses meaningful thresholds based on the problem description.
