Below is the Python function to implement the decision tree classifier based on the given features and the party affiliation target variable. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the features and returns the prediction (party affiliation) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list with placeholders for inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2   # Yes == 2, No == 1
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2                    # Yes == 2, No == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0   # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1   # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0   # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print("Inner Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

In this example:

1. The `nodes` list is initialized with two `None` values, representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
2. The first inner node checks whether the vote on the adoption of the budget resolution is "yes" (encoded as 2). If true, it sets `nodes[0]` to `True` (1); otherwise, it sets it to `False` (0).
3. The second inner node checks whether the vote on aid to El Salvador is "yes" (encoded as 2). If true, it sets `nodes[1]` to `True` (1); otherwise, it sets it to `False` (0).
4. The decision tree logic uses these node values to make the final prediction:
   - If the adoption of the budget resolution is "yes" (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the prediction is Democrat (`0`).
   - If the adoption of the budget resolution is "no" (`nodes[0]` is `False`):
     - If the vote on aid to El Salvador is "yes" (`nodes[1]` is `True`), the prediction is Republican (`1`).
     - If the vote on aid to El Salvador is "no" (`nodes[1]` is `False`), the prediction is Democrat (`0`).

The example usage demonstrates how to call the `predict` function with a set of features and prints the prediction along with the inner node truth values.

This method ensures that you can trace the decision-making process through the list of inner node truth values.
