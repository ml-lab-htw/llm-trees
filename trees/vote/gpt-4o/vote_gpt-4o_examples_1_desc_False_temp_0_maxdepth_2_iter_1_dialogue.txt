Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the "physician fee freeze" vote
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If "physician fee freeze" vote is "no"
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If "physician fee freeze" vote is "yes"
        # Node 1: Check the "el salvador aid" vote
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If "el salvador aid" vote is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If "el salvador aid" vote is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`, `"el salvador aid"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` checks whether the "physician fee freeze" vote is "no" (1). If true, the condition is satisfied, and the node value is `1`. Otherwise, it is `0`.
   - `nodes[1]` checks whether the "el salvador aid" vote is "no" (1). If true, the condition is satisfied, and the node value is `1`. Otherwise, it is `0`.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If the "physician fee freeze" vote is "no" (1), the prediction is Democrat (0).
   - If the "physician fee freeze" vote is "yes" (2), the next decision is based on the "el salvador aid" vote:
     - If the "el salvador aid" vote is "no" (1), the prediction is Democrat (0).
     - If the "el salvador aid" vote is "yes" (2), the prediction is Republican (1).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the predicted party affiliation (`prediction`) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values for the inner nodes
```

### Example Output:
For the above input:
```plaintext
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [False, True]
```

This means the prediction is Democrat (0), and the first condition (`"physician fee freeze" <= 1`) is not satisfied, while the second condition (`"el salvador aid" <= 1`) is satisfied.
