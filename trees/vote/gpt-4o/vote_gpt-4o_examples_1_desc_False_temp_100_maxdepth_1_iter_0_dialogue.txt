Below is the Python function implementing a depth-1 decision tree for predicting the party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on the given dataset and the chosen feature, `"physician fee freeze"`:

### Depth-1 Tree Python Function
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation based on features provided in X.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values. Keys must match the specified feature names.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat.
        nodes (list of int): Truth values of the inner nodes. 1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth value of the inner node
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision rule for the first node (max depth = 1 tree)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 means "yes", 1 means "no"
    
    # Make the prediction based on the truth value of the node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### How It Works:
1. **Input Dictionary (X)**:
   - The `X` argument must be a dictionary where each key corresponds to a feature name and each value corresponds to the associated value for that feature. Ensure feature names and encodings match exactly as described.
   - Example input:
     ```python
     X = {
         "physician fee freeze": 2,  # "yes"
         "handicapped infants": 1,  # "no"
         "water project cost sharing": 2,  # "yes"
         # ... other features
     }
     ```

2. **Truth Values List (nodes)**:
   - The function checks the value of the feature `"physician fee freeze"`.
   - If the condition `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2` (yes) is satisfied, the corresponding position in the `nodes` list is set to `1`. Otherwise, it is set to `0`.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the truth value of the first (and only) node in this depth-1 tree is `1` (i.e., `X["physician fee freeze"] == 2`), the prediction will be `1` (Republican).
   - Otherwise, the prediction will be `0` (Democrat).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X_sample = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,  # "yes"
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2,
}

# Predict using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

# Display the result
print("Prediction (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican):", prediction)
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Prediction (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican): 1
Truth values of inner nodes: [1]
```

In this example, since `"physician fee freeze"` is `2` (yes), the prediction is `1` (Republican), and the corresponding node truth value is `1`.
