Below is the Python function for your decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, considering the feature **"el salvador aid"**, using the structure and conventions you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree to predict party affiliation (1 = republican / 0 = democrat) based on features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary with feature keys as specified, and their corresponding values.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 1 if republican, 0 if democrat.
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the conditions of the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of nodes (depth 1, so only one node exists).
    nodes = [None]
    
    # Evaluate the first condition for the root node.
    # el salvador aid: 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[0] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # Yes vote on el salvador aid
    
    # Make the prediction based on the condition.
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Features**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` where feature names match the keys exactly as provided (e.g., "`el salvador aid`") and their values correspond to the specified encoding.
   
2. **Root Node Condition**:
   - The function checks whether the representative voted "yes" (`2`) on "el salvador aid".
   - If the condition is `True` (i.e., the vote is "yes"), the prediction is `Republican` (`1`).
   - Otherwise, the prediction is `Democrat` (`0`).

3. **Nodes List**:
   - The `nodes` list contains the evaluation of the condition in the root node. Since the tree has a depth of 1, there is only one node in the list.
   - The value is `1` if the condition `X["el salvador aid"] == 2` is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - The first element is the predicted class (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
     - The second element is a list (`nodes`) with the truth value of the condition in the inner node.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X1 = {"handicapped infants": 1, "water project cost sharing": 2, "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
      "physician fee freeze": 1, "el salvador aid": 2, "religious groups in schools": 1,
      "anti satellite test ban": 1, "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1, "mx missile": 2,
      "immigration": 1, "synfuels corporation cutback": 1, "education spending": 2,
      "superfund right to sue": 1, "crime": 2, "duty free exports": 2,
      "export administration act south africa": 1}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X1)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

### Another Example:
```python
# Example input
X2 = {"handicapped infants": 2, "water project cost sharing": 1, "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
      "physician fee freeze": 2, "el salvador aid": 1, "religious groups in schools": 1,
      "anti satellite test ban": 2, "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2, "mx missile": 1,
      "immigration": 2, "synfuels corporation cutback": 2, "education spending": 1,
      "superfund right to sue": 2, "crime": 2, "duty free exports": 1,
      "export administration act south africa": 2}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X2)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0]
