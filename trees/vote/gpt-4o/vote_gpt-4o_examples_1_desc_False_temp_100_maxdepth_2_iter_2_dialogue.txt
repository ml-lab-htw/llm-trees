Here's the Python function based on the decision tree we've induced to classify party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) using the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First condition: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # '1' means "no" vote, '2' means "yes" vote

    # Second condition: Vote on aid to El Salvador
    if nodes[0]:  # Physician fee freeze == no (Democrat-leaning)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Physician fee freeze == yes (Republican-leaning)
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # '2' means "yes" vote, '1' means "no" vote

        if nodes[1]:  # Aid to El Salvador == yes (Republican-leaning)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Aid to El Salvador == no (Democrat-leaning)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first condition checks the vote on **physician fee freeze**. If the vote was **"no"** (encoded as `1`), it leads to a prediction of **Democrat** (0). If the vote was **"yes"** (encoded as `2`), we proceed to the next level.
  
- **Node 1**: If the vote on **physician fee freeze** was "yes," we check the vote on **aid to El Salvador**. If the vote was **"yes"** (encoded as `2`), this leads to a prediction of **Republican** (1). Otherwise, the prediction will be **Democrat** (0).

This function returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`), where each entry represents whether the condition in the corresponding node was satisfied (`True` or `False`).
