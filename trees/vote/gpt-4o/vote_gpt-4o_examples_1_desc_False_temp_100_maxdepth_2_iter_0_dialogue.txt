### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the individual voted **no** on "aid to Nicaraguan contras" (`X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1`). If the condition is true (they voted **no**), the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).
- **Node 1** is only evaluated if the condition in Node 0 is **false** (i.e., they voted **yes** on "aid to Nicaraguan contras"). Then, Node 1 checks if they voted **no** on "physician fee freeze" (`X["physician fee freeze"] == 1`). If true, the prediction is **Republican** (`1`). Otherwise, the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).

This function will return two things:
1. The **prediction** (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican).
2. A list of the **truth values** for the inner nodes that represent the decisions made along the path. Each entry is `1` if the condition was satisfied, and `0` otherwise.
