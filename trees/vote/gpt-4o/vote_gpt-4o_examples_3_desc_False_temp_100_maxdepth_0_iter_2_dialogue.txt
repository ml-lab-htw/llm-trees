To create the decision tree based on the features and encoding you've given, I will fill in the decision nodes as outlined in the previous response. The `predict` function will both return a single prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of truth values for the conditions at the inner nodes.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes based on hypothetical importance and logical splits
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # If physician fee freeze (yes)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze (no)
        if nodes[1]:  # If aid to nicaraguan contras (yes)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras (no)
            if nodes[2]:  # If adoption of the budget resolution (yes)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # adoption of the budget resolution (no)
                if nodes[3]:  # If MX missile (yes)
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:  # MX missile (no)
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example dictionary
example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1, 
    'water project cost sharing': 2, 
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1, 
    'physician fee freeze': 1, 
    'el salvador aid': 2, 
    'religious groups in schools': 1, 
    'anti satellite test ban': 2, 
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1, 
    'mx missile': 1, 
    'immigration': 2, 
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 
    'education spending': 2, 
    'superfund right to sue': 2, 
    'crime': 2, 
    'duty free exports': 2, 
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Example usage
prediction, nodes = predict(example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes Initialization**: The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the decisions at each node.
   
   ```python
   nodes = 4 * [None]
   ```

2. **Node Assignments**: Each node checks a specific condition:
   
   ```python
   nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
   nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
   nodes[2] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
   nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 2
   ```

3. **Decision Tree Logic**: The nested conditional structure follows the logical splits defined earlier to classify the party affiliation:
   
   ```python
   if nodes[0]:  # If physician fee freeze (yes)
       prediction = 0  # Democrat
   else:  # physician fee freeze (no)
       if nodes[1]:  # If aid to nicaraguan contras (yes)
           prediction = 1  # Republican
       else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras (no)
           if nodes[2]:  # If adoption of the budget resolution (yes)
               prediction = 0  # Democrat
           else:  # adoption of the budget resolution (no)
               if nodes[3]:  # If MX missile (yes)
                   prediction = 1  # Republican
               else:  # MX missile (no)
                   prediction = 0  # Democrat
   ```

4. **Return Values**: The function finally returns the prediction along with the truth values of the nodes, making it easy to trace the logic path taken:
   
   ```python
   return prediction, nodes
   ```

### Example Usage:

The example usage creates a dictionary with voting records, calls the `predict` function, and prints the prediction and node truth values.
