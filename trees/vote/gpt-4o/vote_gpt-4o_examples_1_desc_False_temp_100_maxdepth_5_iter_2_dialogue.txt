Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on your given requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the provided decision tree.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys are:
            ['handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 'adoption of the budget resolution', 
            'physician fee freeze', 'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools', 
            'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras', 'mx missile', 'immigration', 
            'synfuels corporation cutback', 'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 
            'crime', 'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa']
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted class (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values representing whether conditions in inner nodes were satisfied (1 if True, 0 if False).
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize the list to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # If 'physician fee freeze' vote is NO
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1       # If 'aid to El Salvador' vote is NO
    nodes[2] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2  # If 'anti-satellite test ban' vote is YES
    nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 1           # If 'MX missile' vote is NO
    nodes[4] = X["crime"] == 2                # If 'crime' vote is YES

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = NO
        if nodes[1]:  # el salvador aid = NO
            if nodes[2]:  # anti satellite test ban = YES
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # anti satellite test ban = NO
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # el salvador aid = YES
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = YES
        if nodes[3]:  # mx missile = NO
            if nodes[4]:  # crime = YES
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # crime = NO
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # mx missile = YES
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    # Return the final prediction and truth values of inner nodes
    return prediction, [int(value) for value in nodes]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary, `X`, where keys represent the features (e.g., "physician fee freeze") and values represent their binary/encoded values as described in the problem (e.g., `2 = yes`, `1 = no`).

2. **Nodes**: Each `nodes[i]` corresponds to a condition in the decision tree. These are boolean conditions (i.e., `True` or `False`), which are stored as a list of integers (`1` for `True` and `0` for `False`).

3. **Decision Tree Rules**:
   - The predictions are made based on the nested `if-else` structure from the earlier decision tree.
   - Thresholds (`1 = no`, `2 = yes`) are used according to the description of each feature.

4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: Either `1` (Republican) or `0` (Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of integers (`0` or `1`), representing whether each inner node condition was satisfied.

### Example Call:

```python
X_example = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
