Here's the Python function implementation based on the decision tree example classifying party affiliation as `republican (1)` or `democrat (0)`. I've included proper thresholds and logical conditions to ensure classifications are aligned with the earlier decision tree description.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) based on a decision tree.
    
    Args:
    - X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys must match the exact names 
      of the features as described in the prompt.

    Returns:
    - prediction (int): 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
    - nodes (list of int): A list of binary values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list to track the truth values of the conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Decision tree inner nodes
    # Root node: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Check if "no"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If physician fee freeze = no
        # Second node: Vote on el salvador aid
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1  # Check if "no"
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If el salvador aid = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If el salvador aid = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    else:  # If physician fee freeze = yes
        # Second node: Vote on MX missile
        nodes[2] = X["mx missile"] == 1  # Check if "no"
        
        if nodes[2]:  # If MX missile = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If MX missile = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

Given the following feature input:

```python
features = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Example Output: [True, False, None]
```

### Explanation of the Model:
1. **Node 0** evaluates the feature "physician fee freeze" (`yes` or `no`) as the root node:
   - If `no`, it proceeds to evaluate "el salvador aid."
   - If `yes`, it proceeds to evaluate "mx missile."

2. **Node 1** (if "physician fee freeze = no") evaluates "el salvador aid" (`yes` or `no`):
   - If `no`, classify as `Democrat`.
   - If `yes`, classify as `Republican`.

3. **Node 2** (if "physician fee freeze = yes") evaluates "mx missile" (`yes` or `no`):
   - If `no`, classify as `Democrat`.
   - If `yes`, classify as `Republican`.

This structure ensures the decision tree logic is clear and implemented correctly.
