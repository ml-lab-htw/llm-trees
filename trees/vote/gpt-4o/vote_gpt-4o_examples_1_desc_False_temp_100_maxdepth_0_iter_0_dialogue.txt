### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks the vote on the **physician fee freeze**. A "yes" vote (encoded as `2`) usually indicates a Republican, so we branch accordingly.
2. **Node 1**: If the voter supported the physician fee freeze, we then check their stance on the **MX missile**. A "yes" vote here reinforces the likelihood of being a Republican, otherwise, the prediction is Democrat.
3. **Node 2**: If the voter opposed the physician fee freeze, we check their vote on **education spending**. A "yes" vote here suggests a Democrat, while a "no" vote requires further investigation.
4. **Node 3**: If the voter opposed both the physician fee freeze and education spending, we check their stance on **aid to El Salvador**. A "yes" vote indicates a Republican, while a "no" vote suggests a Democrat.

This function returns both the **prediction** (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list of **nodes** that reflect whether each condition was satisfied (1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise).
