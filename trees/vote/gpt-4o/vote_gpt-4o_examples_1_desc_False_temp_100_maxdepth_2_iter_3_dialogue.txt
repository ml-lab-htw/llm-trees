Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier using the provided feature names and structure:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze == no (1)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1
    
    # Node 1: Vote on el salvador aid == no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If physician fee freeze == no (1), classify as Democrat
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If physician fee freeze == yes (2)
        if nodes[1]:  # If el salvador aid == no (1), classify as Democrat
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If el salvador aid == yes (2), classify as Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if the value for "physician fee freeze" is **1** (no). If it's true, the classifier predicts **Democrat** (0).
2. If **Node 0** is false (i.e., "physician fee freeze" is **2** (yes)), it moves to **Node 1**, which checks if "el salvador aid" is **1** (no).
   - If **Node 1** is true (el salvador aid == no), it predicts **Democrat** (0).
   - If **Node 1** is false (el salvador aid == yes), it predicts **Republican** (1).

This function returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (whether the conditions were satisfied or not).
