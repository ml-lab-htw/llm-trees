```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes / 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes / 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Node 2: Vote on education spending (2 = yes / 1 = no)
            nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 3: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes / 1 = no)
        nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0:** The first split checks the vote on "aid to Nicaraguan contras". If the vote is "yes" (encoded as 2), it moves to the next split, otherwise, it checks the other branch.
2. **Node 1:** If the vote on "physician fee freeze" is "yes" (encoded as 2), the prediction will be Republican (1).
3. **Node 2:** If the vote on "education spending" is "yes" (encoded as 2), the prediction will be Democrat (0), otherwise, it will be Republican (1).
4. **Node 3:** If the vote on the "adoption of the budget resolution" is "yes" (encoded as 2), the prediction will be Republican (1), otherwise, Democrat (0).

This function applies the decision tree logic to a given set of votes (input as a dictionary `X`), and returns both the prediction and the list `nodes`, which contains boolean values indicating whether or not each condition (node) was satisfied.
