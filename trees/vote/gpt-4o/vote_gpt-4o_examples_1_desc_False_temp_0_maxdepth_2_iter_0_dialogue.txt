Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check "physician fee freeze"
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # "physician fee freeze" is no
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "physician fee freeze" is yes
        # Node 1: Check "el salvador aid"
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # "el salvador aid" is no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "el salvador aid" is yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`, `"el salvador aid"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values (e.g., 1 for "no", 2 for "yes").
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition at the first split (`"physician fee freeze" <= 1`).
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition at the second split (`"el salvador aid" <= 1`).
3. **Logic**:
   - If `"physician fee freeze"` is "no" (1), the prediction is Democrat (0).
   - If `"physician fee freeze"` is "yes" (2), the function checks `"el salvador aid"`.
     - If `"el salvador aid"` is "no" (1), the prediction is Democrat (0).
     - If `"el salvador aid"` is "yes" (2), the prediction is Republican (1).
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds (e.g., `<= 1`) are based on the feature encoding provided in the prompt.
- The function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the correct spelling and encoding.
