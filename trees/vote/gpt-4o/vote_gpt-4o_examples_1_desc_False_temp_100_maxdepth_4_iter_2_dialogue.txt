Here is the implementation of your requested decision tree in Python, tailored to classify the party affiliation based on the provided features, feature keys, and target encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation based on voting records and thresholds in the decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary containing feature values for a given instance.

    Returns:
        tuple: (int, list) where the first element is the predicted class (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican),
               and the second element is a list of truth values for the internal nodes.
    """
    # Truth values for internal nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Internal nodes of the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5       # (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[2] = X["duty free exports"] <= 1.5     # (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] <= 1.5  # (2 = yes, 1 = no)

    # Predict the class based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze: no
        if nodes[1]:  # el salvador aid: no
            if nodes[2]:  # duty free exports: no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # duty free exports: yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # el salvador aid: yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze: yes
        if nodes[3]:  # adoption of the budget resolution: no
            if X["education spending"] <= 1.5:  # (2 = yes, 1 = no)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending: yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # adoption of the budget resolution: yes
            if X["anti satellite test ban"] <= 1.5:  # (2 = yes, 1 = no)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # anti satellite test ban: yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the code:
1. **Input Features**:
   - The `X` argument is a dictionary, where keys are feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`) and values correspond to the encoded feature values as described in the problem statement.

2. **Threshold Splits**:
   - Each node condition is determined based on feature values. For example, `X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5` checks if the vote is "no" (`1`).

3. **Internal Nodes**:
   - The list `nodes` stores truth values for the 4 inner nodes of the decision tree. A value of `1` indicates that the condition for the node is satisfied, and `0` means it is not.

4. **Prediction Logic**:
   - The tree logic is structured with nested if-else statements to evaluate the conditions at each depth level. 
   - Depending on the values of `nodes` and leaf conditions, the function predicts the target class (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
     - `nodes`: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
Here is an example usage of the function with a specific input:

```python
# Example feature set
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Predict the party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Republican) or 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 0, 1, 0] (example inner node truth values)
```

This outputs the predicted political affiliation along with the truth values of the decision tree nodes.
