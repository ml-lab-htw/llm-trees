Based on the described features and specific conditions, here is a function that makes predictions using a decision tree of depth 2, including returning the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the nodes
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # Checks if "physician fee freeze" is 'yes'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Move to the second node if the first condition is not satisfied
        nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 2  # Checks if "mx missile" is 'yes'
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage with feature values
# Features: ['handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 'adoption of the budget resolution', 'physician fee freeze', 'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools', 'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras', 'mx missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels corporation cutback', 'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 'crime', 'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa']
example_features = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,  # no
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,  # yes
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

In the `predict` function:
- The first condition checks if the vote on the "physician fee freeze" was "yes" (encoded as `2`). If true, the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
- If the first condition is false, it moves to the second condition that checks if the vote on the "mx missile" was "yes" (encoded as `2`). If this condition is true, the prediction is `1` (Republican). Otherwise, it predicts `0` (Democrat).

The function returns a tuple with the prediction and a list of boolean values representing whether each condition (node) was satisfied.
