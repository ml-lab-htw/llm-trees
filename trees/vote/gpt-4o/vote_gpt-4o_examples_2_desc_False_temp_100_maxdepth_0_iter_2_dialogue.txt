Certainly! Below is a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on the specified votes. The function returns the classification (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes are satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["synfuels corporation cutback"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["education spending"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, truth_values = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", truth_values)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Definitions:**
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is "yes" (i.e., 2). If yes, classify as **Republican**.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the vote on MX missile is "yes" (i.e., 2). If yes, proceed further.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the vote on synfuels corporation cutback is "yes" (i.e., 2). If yes, classify as **Republican**. Otherwise, **Democrat**.
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the vote on education spending is "yes" (i.e., 2). If yes, classify as **Democrat**.
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is "yes" (i.e., 2). If yes, classify as **Republican**. Otherwise, **Democrat**.

2. **Returning Results:**
   - `prediction`: The final classification result (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values indicating whether the conditions at each node were met.

### Usage:
- The `predict` function takes a dictionary `X` representing an individual's voting record.
- The function returns the predicted party affiliation and a list of Boolean values representing whether the conditions of the different nodes in the decision tree are satisfied.
