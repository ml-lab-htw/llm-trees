Here is the Python function representing the decision tree that satisfies your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize the list with placeholders for 2 inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # Check the first condition
        if nodes[1]:  # Check the second condition
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node Conditions:**
   - `nodes[0]` checks whether the vote on "adoption of the budget resolution" equals `1` (a "no" vote in your encoding).
   - `nodes[1]` checks whether the vote on "el salvador aid" equals `1` (a "no" vote in your encoding).

2. **Logic of the Tree**:
   - If the "adoption of the budget resolution" condition is met (`nodes[0] = True`), it moves to check "el salvador aid".
     - If "el salvador aid" is also `True`, the prediction is `Democrat (0)`.
     - If "el salvador aid" is `False`, the prediction is `Republican (1)`.
   - If the first condition (`nodes[0]`) is not met, it directly predicts `Democrat (0)`.

3. **Returned Output:**
   - The function returns `prediction` (the target class: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and `nodes` (a list representing whether the condition at each inner node is satisfied: `1` for satisfied, `0` otherwise).
