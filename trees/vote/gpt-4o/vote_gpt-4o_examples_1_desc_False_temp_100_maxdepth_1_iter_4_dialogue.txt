Based on the given task, we will create a Python function for the decision tree classifier. The feature we use is `physician fee freeze` because itâ€™s the most important feature as per our earlier decision tree. We'll implement a depth-1 decision tree with the inner node as the split condition, and it will return both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on the vote on 'physician fee freeze'.
    Depth 1 decision tree:
    - If 'physician fee freeze' == 1 (no), predict 0 (Democrat)
    - If 'physician fee freeze' == 2 (yes), predict 1 (Republican)
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values where keys are feature names 
                  and values are the corresponding feature values.
                  Example: {"physician fee freeze": 1, "handicapped infants": 2, ...}

    Returns:
        int: The predicted class (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)
        list: A list of truth values (1 if split condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = (X["physician fee freeze"] == 1)  # Condition representing ('physician fee freeze' == no)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Condition is TRUE
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Condition is FALSE
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### How It Works:

1. **Input**:
   - The input `X` is a dictionary where the key is the feature name (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`) and the value is the corresponding feature value (e.g., `1` for "no").
   
2. **Truth Values of Inner Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` represents whether the split condition `X["physician fee freeze"] == 1` is satisfied (`1` if true, `0` if false).

3. **Logic**:
   - If `X["physician fee freeze"] == 1` (vote is "no"), then the person is classified as a Democrat (`prediction = 0`).
   - Else, the person is classified as a Republican (`prediction = 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The classified party affiliation (`0 = Democrat`, `1 = Republican`).
   - `nodes`: A list where each element is `1` if the inner node condition is satisfied, otherwise `0`.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example 1: Democrat case
X = {"physician fee freeze": 1, "handicapped infants": 2, "education spending": 2}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1] (condition satisfied)

# Example 2: Republican case
X = {"physician fee freeze": 2, "handicapped infants": 1, "education spending": 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0] (condition not satisfied)
```

This function is designed to be extensible if the decision tree becomes more complex in the future. For now, it is depth-1 and fulfills the requirements based on `physician fee freeze`.
