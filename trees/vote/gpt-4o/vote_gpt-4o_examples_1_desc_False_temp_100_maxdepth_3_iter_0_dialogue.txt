Here is a Python function that implements a decision tree classifier of depth 3 using the feature set for party affiliation prediction. The function returns the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Democrat = 0, Republican = 1) based on voting features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        'handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 
        'adoption of the budget resolution', 'physician fee freeze', 
        'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools', 
        'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras', 
        'mx missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels corporation cutback', 
        'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 'crime', 
        'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa'

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
        nodes: a list of length 3, with truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 
               0 otherwise) for the three inner nodes of the decision tree
    """

    nodes = [None] * 3
    # Node 1: Splitting on 'mx missile'
    nodes[0] = X["mx missile"] == 2  # If voted "yes" (2)

    if nodes[0]:  # If MX missile vote is "yes" (Republican-leaning)
        # Node 2: Splitting on 'el salvador aid'
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # If voted "yes" (2)

        if nodes[1]:  # If el salvador aid vote is "yes" (Republican-leaning)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If el salvador aid vote is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    else:  # If MX missile vote is "no" (Democrat-leaning)
        # Node 2: Splitting on 'physician fee freeze'
        nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # If voted "yes" (2)

        if nodes[1]:  # If physician fee freeze vote is "yes" (Republican-leaning)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If physician fee freeze vote is "no" (Democrat-leaning)
            # Node 3: Splitting on 'crime'
            nodes[2] = X["crime"] == 2  # If voted "yes" (2)

            if nodes[2]:  # If crime vote is "yes" (Republican-leaning)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # If crime vote is "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Fill nodes[2] with False if it was not evaluated (tree depth < 3 for this path)
    if nodes[2] is None:
        nodes[2] = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

- **Input**: The function takes a `dict` named `X` with 16 keys corresponding to the voting features specified in the problem. Each key represents a specific vote, with values encoded as `1` (no) or `2` (yes).
- **Output**: The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the three inner nodes of the decision tree.

- **Decision Flow**:
  - **Node 1**: The root node splits on `'mx missile'`. A "yes" vote (`2`) is Republican-leaning, while a "no" vote (`1`) is Democrat-leaning.
  - **Node 2**: If the first split is satisfied, the second split checks `'el salvador aid'`. A "yes" vote (`2`) is Republican-leaning.
  - **Node 3**: Otherwise, if `'mx missile'` is "no," the next split is on `'physician fee freeze'` and then `'crime'`.

- **Handling Depth and Nodes**:
  - The tree is limited to a depth of 3. If a path doesn't reach Node 3, the corresponding truth value in `nodes` is explicitly set to `0`.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1,
}

# Predict using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the input above, where `'mx missile'` is `2`, `'el salvador aid'` is `2`:
```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes values: [1, 1, 0]
```
