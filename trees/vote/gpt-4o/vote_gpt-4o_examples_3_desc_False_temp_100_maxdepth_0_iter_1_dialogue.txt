Based on your criteria and examples, here is a function that takes in a dictionary of features and returns a prediction for the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) as well as a list of truth values for the intermediate nodes in a decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [0]  # Initialize the list for truth values of the nodes
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

Here's a brief explanation of the function:

- The `predict` function initializes a list (`nodes`) to keep track of the intermediate truth values.
- It checks the values of the features `"adoption of the budget resolution"`, `"physician fee freeze"`, and `"aid to nicaraguan contras"`.
- Based on the values of these features (whether they are `2` for `yes` or `1` for `no`), it determines the truth value of each node and populates the `nodes` list.
- Finally, it uses the truth values of the nodes to predict whether the party affiliation is Republican (`1`) or Democrat (`0`).

Here's how you can use this function to make predictions:

```python
features = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This example will print the predicted party affiliation (`Republican` or `Democrat`) and the list of truth values for the nodes used in the decision tree.
