Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the described features. The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values representing the conditions of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict a party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on input features and a decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of features with the following keys:
            'handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 
            'adoption of the budget resolution', 'physician fee freeze', 
            'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools', 
            'anti satellite test ban', 'aid to nicaraguan contras', 
            'mx missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels corporation cutback', 
            'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 'crime', 
            'duty free exports', 'export administration act south africa'

    Returns:
        tuple: 
            - prediction (int): Target value (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)
            - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes of the decision tree 
              (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Define the decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1  # Democrat if no support for aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1       # Democrat if no support for physician fee freeze
    nodes[2] = X["mx missile"] <= 1                # Democrat if no support for MX missile
    nodes[3] = X["anti satellite test ban"] <= 1   # Democrat if no support for anti-satellite test ban
    nodes[4] = X["duty free exports"] <= 1         # Democrat if no support for duty-free exports

    # Tree traversal based on node conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras <= 1
        if nodes[1]:  # physician fee freeze <= 1
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # physician fee freeze > 1
            if nodes[2]:  # mx missile <= 1
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # mx missile > 1
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras > 1
        if nodes[3]:  # anti satellite test ban <= 1
            if nodes[4]:  # duty free exports <= 1
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # duty free exports > 1
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # anti satellite test ban > 1
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input:**
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` where keys are the feature names (e.g., `'physician fee freeze'`) and values are their corresponding values (e.g., `1` for "no" or `2` for "yes").
   
2. **Nodes:**
   - The list `nodes` contains the boolean conditions evaluated during the decision tree traversal. For each inner node, `1` indicates the condition is satisfied, and `0` indicates it is not.

3. **Tree Structure:**
   - The decision tree uses `"aid to nicaraguan contras"` as the root node since this is a highly distinguishing feature.
   - Subsequent nodes follow a logical flow to split Democrats and Republicans based on their votes for other issues like `"physician fee freeze"`, `"mx missile"`, etc.
   - The final prediction is determined after evaluating the relevant feature conditions.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: `0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner node conditions

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
input_features = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(input_features)

# Output the result
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output:
For the above example input:
```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
```
