Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the "physician fee freeze" vote
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # "physician fee freeze" vote is "no"
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "physician fee freeze" vote is "yes"
        # Node 1: Check the "el salvador aid" vote
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # "el salvador aid" vote is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "el salvador aid" vote is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`, `"el salvador aid"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values (e.g., 1 for "no", 2 for "yes").
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5`.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5`.
3. **Logic**:
   - If the "physician fee freeze" vote is "no" (≤ 1.5), the prediction is **Democrat** (0).
   - If the "physician fee freeze" vote is "yes" (> 1.5), the function checks the "el salvador aid" vote:
     - If the "el salvador aid" vote is "no" (≤ 1.5), the prediction is **Democrat** (0).
     - If the "el salvador aid" vote is "yes" (> 1.5), the prediction is **Republican** (1).
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- `"physician fee freeze"` = 2 (yes), so `nodes[0] = False` (condition not satisfied).
- `"el salvador aid"` = 1 (no), so `nodes[1] = True` (condition satisfied).
- Based on the decision tree, the prediction is **Democrat** (0).
