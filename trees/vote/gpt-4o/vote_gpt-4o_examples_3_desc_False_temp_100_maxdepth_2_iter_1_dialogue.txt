Given the requirements, let's implement the decision tree as a Python function. The function will evaluate the nodes and return both the prediction and a list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.

Here's the function based on the simplified decision tree outlined previously:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Determine the truth value of the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2
    nodes[1] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {
#     'handicapped infants': 1,
#     'water project cost sharing': 1,
#     'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
#     'physician fee freeze': 1,
#     'el salvador aid': 2,
#     'religious groups in schools': 1,
#     'anti satellite test ban': 1,
#     'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
#     'mx missile': 2,
#     'immigration': 2,
#     'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
#     'education spending': 2,
#     'superfund right to sue': 2,
#     'crime': 2,
#     'duty free exports': 1,
#     'export administration act south africa': 2
# }
# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 or 1
# print("Node truth values:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]

```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0** checks if the vote on "aid to Nicaraguan contras" is "yes" (which is encoded as 2). If this condition is satisfied, the prediction is Republican (encoded as 1).
2. **Node 1** checks if the vote on the "adoption of the budget resolution" is "yes" (which is encoded as 2). This node is checked only if the first condition is not satisfied. If this condition is satisfied, the prediction is Democrat (encoded as 0); otherwise, it defaults to Republican.

Make sure to call the `predict` function with a dictionary matching the exact key names and value encodings provided. The function will return the predicted party affiliation and the list of truth values for the inner nodes in the decision tree.
