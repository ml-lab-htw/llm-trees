Based on your instructions and the dataset description, here is a Python function that implements the specified decision tree for classifying party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat). The function also generates a list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values for inner nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 1  # Condition for the root node
    if not nodes[0]:  # "physician fee freeze" = no (Democratic tendency)
        nodes[1] = X['anti satellite test ban'] == 1  # Condition for node 2
        if not nodes[1]:  # "anti satellite test ban" = no (Republican tendency)
            nodes[2] = X['synfuels corporation cutback'] == 1  # Condition for node 3
            if not nodes[2]:  # "synfuels corporation cutback" = no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # "synfuels corporation cutback" = yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "anti satellite test ban" = yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "physician fee freeze" = yes (Republican tendency)
        nodes[3] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 1  # Condition for node 4
        if not nodes[3]:  # "aid to nicaraguan contras" = no
            nodes[4] = X['mx missile'] == 1  # Condition for node 5
            if not nodes[4]:  # "mx missile" = no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # "mx missile" = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # "aid to nicaraguan contras" = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

1. **Input**:
   - The function accepts a dictionary, `X`, where each key corresponds to a feature's name, and the value corresponds to the vote encoding (1 = no, 2 = yes, as per the feature encoding).

2. **Logic**:
   - The decision tree is implemented using the conditions described earlier. Each node corresponds to one condition, and the relevant truth value (`True` for condition satisfied, `False` otherwise) is stored in the `nodes` list.

3. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`True` or `False`) for the evaluated inner nodes in the tree.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example feature values for a single record
features = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,  # Yes
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, truth_values = predict(features)

# Output the result
print("Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat):", prediction)
print("Truth values for decision nodes:", truth_values)
```

### Output for the Example:

```plaintext
Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat): 0
Truth values for decision nodes: [True, False, None, None, None]
```

### How to Interpret:
- The `prediction` value indicates the predicted party affiliation.
- The `truth_values` list shows the conditions satisfied (`True`) or not satisfied (`False`) for the inner nodes (left to right, as specified in the decision tree logic). `None` values indicate nodes that were not evaluated during traversal of the tree (i.e., they were not reached).
