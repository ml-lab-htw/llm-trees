Sure, I'll format the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) using the specified features. The function will follow the structure provided and will include a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Vote against physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 1  # Vote against anti-satellite test ban
    nodes[2] = X["mx missile"] == 1  # Vote against MX missile
    nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1  # Vote against budget resolution

    if nodes[0]:  # (No) on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # (No) on anti-satellite test ban
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # (Yes) on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # (No) on MX missile
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # (Yes) on MX missile
            if nodes[3]:  # (No) on budget resolution
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

Explanation of the `nodes` list:
1. `nodes[0]`: True if the vote on "physician fee freeze" is "No" (indicating Dem inclination).
2. `nodes[1]`: True if the vote on "anti-satellite test ban" is "No" (indicating Dem inclination).
3. `nodes[2]`: True if the vote on "MX missile" is "No" (indicating Dem inclination).
4. `nodes[3]`: True if the vote on "adoption of the budget resolution" is "No" (indicating Dem inclination).

Using these nodes, the decision path is determined, and a prediction is made:
- If the first vote is "No" on "physician fee freeze" and also "No" on "anti-satellite test ban", it's classified as Democrat.
- If the first vote is "No" on "physician fee freeze" but "Yes" on "anti-satellite test ban", it's classified as Republican.
- If the first vote is "Yes" on "physician fee freeze" and "No" on "MX missile", it's classified as Democrat.
- If the first vote is "Yes" on "physician fee freeze" and "Yes" on "MX missile", then "No" on budget resolution, it's classified as Democrat.
- Otherwise, it's classified as Republican.
