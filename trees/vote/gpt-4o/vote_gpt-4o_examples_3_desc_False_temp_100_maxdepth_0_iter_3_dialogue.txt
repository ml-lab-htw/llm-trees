```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["duty free exports"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["synfuels corporation cutback"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
                
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
- I created a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
- Each node condition checks the value of a specific feature against its threshold (which is `2` if `yes` and `1` if `no`).
- The tree first splits on the "adoption of the budget resolution", followed by "el salvador aid", then "duty free exports", and so on.
- Based on the tree's structure, it provides a final prediction for party affiliation and a list of the truth values of the inner nodes.

Remember to validate and potentially tweak this decision tree model based on actual data to ensure it most accurately represents the classification rules for party affiliation.
