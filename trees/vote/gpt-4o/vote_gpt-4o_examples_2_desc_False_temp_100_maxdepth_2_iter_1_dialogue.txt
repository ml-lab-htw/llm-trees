Let's create a Python function to represent our decision tree classifier. The function will take a dictionary of features as input and return the predicted class along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

Given the encoding of the features, we'll use the exact keys as specified and apply the decision logic based on the assumed significant features:
1. Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
2. Vote on crime
3. Vote on aid to El Salvador

Here is the `predict` function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Check the vote on the budget resolution
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted yes on the budget resolution, check the vote on crime
        nodes[1] = X["crime"] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # If voted no on the budget resolution, check the vote on aid to El Salvador
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
Let's demonstrate how to use this function with a sample input:

```python
# Sample input dictionary for a voter
sample_voter = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

# Predict the party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_voter)
print("Prediction (1 = Republican / 0 = Democrat):", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Expected Output:
For the given sample input, the expected output will be:
```
Prediction (1 = Republican / 0 = Democrat): 1
Nodes: [True, True]
```

The `nodes` list indicates:
- `True` at index 0: The individual voted yes on the adoption of the budget resolution.
- `True` at index 1: The individual voted yes on the crime issue, resulting in a Republican classification.
