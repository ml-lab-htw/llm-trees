Certainly! Based on the specific features and target variable, here is how you can structure a Python function to implement the given decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Checking the conditions for the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2
    
    # Decision tree traversal based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
                
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# features = {
#     "handicapped infants": 2,
#     "water project cost sharing": 1,
#     "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
#     "physician fee freeze": 1,
#     "el salvador aid": 1,
#     "religious groups in schools": 2,
#     "anti satellite test ban": 1,
#     "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
#     "mx missile": 2,
#     "immigration": 1,
#     "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
#     "education spending": 2,
#     "superfund right to sue": 1,
#     "crime": 2,
#     "duty free exports": 1,
#     "export administration act south africa": 1
# }
# prediction, nodes = predict(features)
# print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
# print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function, `predict` takes a dictionary `X` of features and returns a tuple containing:
1. `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
2. `nodes`: A list representing whether each inner node's condition is satisfied (1 if the condition is true, 0 if false).

### Example Usage

Let's run an example to see how it works.

```python
features = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Root Node** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if the vote on the physician fee freeze is "yes" (`2`).
   - If true (Republican), return 1.
   - If false (go to next node).

2. **Second Node** (`nodes[1]`): Checks if the vote on the adoption of the budget resolution is "yes" (`2`).
   - If true (Democrat), return 0.
   - If false (go to next node).

3. **Third Node** (`nodes[2]`): Checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is "yes" (`2`).
   - If true (Republican), return 1.
   - If false (Democrat), return 0.

The `nodes` list tracks whether each condition at each decision point in the tree is met (`1` for true, `0` for false). This can be useful for understanding the decision path taken to arrive at the classification.
