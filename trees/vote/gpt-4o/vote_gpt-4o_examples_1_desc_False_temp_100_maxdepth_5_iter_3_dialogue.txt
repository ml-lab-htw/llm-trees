Hereâ€™s the Python function that implements the decision tree using the described features and format. This tree predicts "party affiliation" based on the voting features you provided. It also returns the conditions at each inner node as a list of `truth values`:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of inner node conditions.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary of feature values for a single data point.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1), and a list of inner node conditions (1 if true, 0 if false).
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Inner node conditions (use binary feature values for conditions)
    nodes[0] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1  # Checking if vote is "no" for El Salvador aid
    nodes[1] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1  # Checking if vote is "no" for budget resolution adoption
    nodes[2] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Checking if vote is "no" for physician fee freeze
    nodes[3] = X["crime"] == 1  # Checking if vote is "no" for crime
    nodes[4] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2  # Checking if vote is "yes" for anti-satellite test ban
    
    # Decision process
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if X["mx missile"] == 2:  # Checking if vote is "yes" for MX missile
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
                
    # Convert truth values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Conditions (Nodes):**
   - The tree has 5 inner nodes, corresponding to split conditions based on the most important features.
   - Each condition is evaluated based on the values in the input dictionary (`X`), which contains the feature names and their binary values as keys/values.

2. **Feature Checks:**
   - `el salvador aid`, `adoption of the budget resolution`, `physician fee freeze`, `crime`, etc., are used for splitting.
   - For binary features, equality comparisons (`==`) are used. For example:
     - `el salvador aid == 1`: Checks if the vote is "no".
     - `anti satellite test ban == 2`: Checks if the vote is "yes".

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - The prediction is based on traversing the tree using the inner node conditions.
   - The process follows the structure of the tree provided.

4. **Outputs:**
   - `prediction`: The party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of binary values (`1` for the condition satisfied, `0` for not) indicating whether the condition at each inner node was true.

### Example Usage
#### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}
```

#### Example Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
```

### Tree Explanation for This Input:
- `el salvador aid` is `1` (no), so `nodes[0] = 1`.
- `adoption of the budget resolution` is `2` (yes), so `nodes[1] = 0`.
- `physician fee freeze` is `1` (no), so `nodes[2] = 1`.
- `crime` is `2` (yes), so `nodes[3] = 0`.
- `anti satellite test ban` is `2` (yes), so `nodes[4] = 1`.

Thus, the tree predicts `1` (Republican), and the node conditions are `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
