Sure, I can format a decision tree for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the provided voting features. Below is a Python function that follows the structure you've described, using the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Number of decision points in our tree

    nodes[0] = X['anti satellite test ban'] == 1  # Corresponding to "Vote on anti-satellite test ban (no)"
    nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 1  # Corresponding to "Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (no)"

    if nodes[0]:  # anti satellite test ban (no)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras (no)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- `nodes[0] = X['anti satellite test ban'] == 1`: This checks if the vote on the anti-satellite test ban was "no."
- `nodes[1] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 1`: This checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras was "no."

Given the votes:
1. If the vote on the anti-satellite test ban is "no," the prediction is Democrat.
2. If the vote on the anti-satellite test ban is "yes," move to the next node.
3. If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "no," the prediction is again Democrat.
4. If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "yes," the prediction is Republican.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,  # no
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,  # yes
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will check the conditions sequentially and return the predicted party affiliation along with the truth values of the decision points in the tree.
