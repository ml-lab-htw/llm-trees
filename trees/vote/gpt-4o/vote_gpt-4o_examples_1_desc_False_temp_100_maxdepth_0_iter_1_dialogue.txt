Here's the Python function based on the decision tree structure and feature set you provided. The function evaluates the inner nodes of the decision tree, stores the truth values of the conditions at each decision point, and finally returns a prediction for party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # We have 5 internal nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Democrat: no (1), Republican: yes (2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
        nodes[1] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2  # Republican: yes (2)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Node 2: Vote on anti satellite test ban
            nodes[2] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 1  # Democrat: no (1)
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 3: Vote on el salvador aid
        nodes[3] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1  # Democrat: no (1), Republican: yes (2)
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Vote on mx missile
            nodes[4] = X["mx missile"] == 1  # Democrat: no (1), Republican: yes (2)
            
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Nodes**: We initialize a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the conditions at each split. There are 5 decision nodes in this tree.
  
- **Node 0**: We first check the vote on **physician fee freeze** (historically a strong partisan issue). If this vote is "no" (1), it's more likely a Democrat. If it's "yes" (2), it's more likely a Republican.
  
- **Node 1**: If the vote on the **physician fee freeze** is "yes" (Republican), we check the vote on **adoption of the budget resolution**. Republicans are more likely to vote "yes" on this, so if it's "yes" (2), the prediction is Republican (1). Otherwise, we move further.

- **Node 2**: If the vote on the **adoption of the budget resolution** is "no," we check the **anti satellite test ban** vote. Democrats are more likely to vote "no" (1) on this. If this condition is true, the party is predicted to be Democrat (0); otherwise, Republican (1).

- **Node 3**: If the vote on **physician fee freeze** is "no" (Democrat), we check the vote on **el salvador aid**. Democrats are more likely to vote "no" (1) on this. If the vote is "no," we move further.

- **Node 4**: If the vote on **el salvador aid** is "no," we check the vote on the **mx missile**. Democrats are more likely to vote "no" (1) on this. If this is true, the prediction is Democrat (0); otherwise, Republican (1).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input: dictionary of votes
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 1,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat):", prediction)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)
```

This function will output the predicted party affiliation along with a list of truth values for each internal node, indicating whether the conditions were satisfied or not.
