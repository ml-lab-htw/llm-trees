Using the given feature keys and target variable, I'll provide a Python function to describe the decision tree. The tree has a maximum depth of 1, with the most important feature chosen as `"physician fee freeze"`. Based on the example format, here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) based on the feature values in X.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values where keys match the feature names 
                  (as defined in the task prompt).
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # List to hold truth values of inner nodes (we have one decision node here).
    
    # Decision node 1: "physician fee freeze" feature
    # The feature is encoded as "2 = yes, 1 = no"
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 1 if the vote is "yes", 0 otherwise.
    
    # Prediction based on the condition at the decision node
    if nodes[0]:  # If "physician fee freeze" = yes
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:          # If "physician fee freeze" = no
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features for a single individual
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 1, 
    'water project cost sharing': 2, 
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1, 
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # This individual voted "yes" (2)
    'el salvador aid': 1, 
    'religious groups in schools': 1, 
    'anti satellite test ban': 1, 
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1, 
    'mx missile': 1, 
    'immigration': 1, 
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 
    'education spending': 1, 
    'superfund right to sue': 1, 
    'crime': 1, 
    'duty free exports': 1, 
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For `X_example` where `"physician fee freeze": 2` (yes):
```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1]
```

For `X_example` where `"physician fee freeze": 1` (no):
```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0]
```

### Notes:
1. The function's logic is concise, with the truth value for the inner node (`nodes[0]`) evaluated first. This aligns with the format provided in the example.
2. The decision is based solely on whether the `"physician fee freeze"` vote was `"yes"` (2) or `"no"` (1).
3. The output includes both the classification result (`prediction`) and the list of truth values (`nodes`), making it easy to debug and trace the decision process.
