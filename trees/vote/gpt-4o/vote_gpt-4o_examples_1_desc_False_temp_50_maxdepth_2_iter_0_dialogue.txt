Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys should match the feature names exactly.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for each inner node.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Node 0: Check if "physician fee freeze" is No (1)
    if nodes[0]:  # If "physician fee freeze" is No
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If "physician fee freeze" is Yes
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1  # Node 1: Check if "el salvador aid" is No (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # If "el salvador aid" is No
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If "el salvador aid" is Yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**:
   - `X`: A dictionary where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`, `"el salvador aid"`) and the values are the feature values (e.g., `1` for No, `2` for Yes, as per the feature encoding).

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the first inner node, which checks if `"physician fee freeze"` is `No (1)`.
   - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the second inner node, which checks if `"el salvador aid"` is `No (1)`.

3. **Logic**:
   - If `"physician fee freeze"` is `No` (1), the prediction is `Democrat (0)`.
   - If `"physician fee freeze"` is `Yes` (2), the second feature, `"el salvador aid"`, is checked:
     - If `"el salvador aid"` is `No` (1), the prediction is `Democrat (0)`.
     - If `"el salvador aid"` is `Yes` (2), the prediction is `Republican (1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the result
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Expected output: [1, None]
```

### Example Explanation:
- In the example:
  - `"physician fee freeze"` is `No (1)`, so `nodes[0] = 1`, and the prediction is `Democrat (0)`.
  - The second node (`nodes[1]`) is not evaluated because the first condition already determined the outcome.

This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 and provides the required truth values for the inner nodes.
