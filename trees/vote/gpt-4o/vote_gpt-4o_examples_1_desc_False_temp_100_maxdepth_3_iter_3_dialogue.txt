Here is the requested Python function to implement the decision tree for predicting "party affiliation" (Republican or Democrat) with the given features, encoding, and thresholds. The function includes both the prediction and truth value evaluation for each inner node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on voting features
    and evaluates the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    X: dict
        A dictionary containing feature values. Keys must match the exact spelling of the features.

    Returns:
    --------
    prediction: int
        The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
    nodes: list[int]
        A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # List to hold truth values for inner nodes

    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # Inner node 1: "aid to nicaraguan contras = no"
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # Inner node 2: "physician fee freeze = yes"
    nodes[2] = X["mx missile"] == 2  # Inner node 3: "mx missile = yes"

    # Decision logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = no
        if nodes[1]:  # physician fee freeze = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # physician fee freeze = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = yes
        if nodes[2]:  # mx missile = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # mx missile = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Usage Example:
To make a prediction with this function, you would supply a `dict` where the keys are the specific feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values for the instance you want to classify. Example:

```python
# Example input data (dictionary of feature values)
input_data = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(input_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)")
print(f"Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

### Execution Explanation:
1. The function evaluates the three conditions in the decision tree:
   - `aid to nicaraguan contras` (node 1).
   - `physician fee freeze` (node 2).
   - `mx missile` (node 3).
2. It determines the truth value (1 if satisfied, 0 otherwise) for each condition and saves this in the `nodes` list.
3. Based on the truth values of the conditions, the tree logic determines the predicted class (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
4. Both the prediction and the `nodes` list are returned.

With this representation, the tree structure and the truth values of inner nodes are easily interpretable, and the function adheres to the requested format!
