Here's the implementation of the decision tree classifier in Python based on the features and target variable you provided. The tree uses meaningful thresholds based on typical historical voting patterns to classify party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat), with a maximum depth of 4.

### Code Implementation

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to track the truth values of the nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Internal node evaluations
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Republican typically vote "yes" for this
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1       # Republicans often vote "yes" for aid to El Salvador
    nodes[2] = X["duty free exports"] == 1     # Democrats typically vote "no" for duty-free exports
    nodes[3] = X["education spending"] == 2    # Democrats often vote "yes" on higher education spending

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Physician fee freeze vote is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # Aid to El Salvador is "no"
            if nodes[2]:  # Duty-free exports is "no"
                if nodes[3]:  # Support for education spending is "yes"
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:  # Education spending is "no"
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Duty-free exports is "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Aid to El Salvador is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Physician fee freeze vote is "yes"
        if nodes[2]:  # Duty-free exports is "no"
            if nodes[3]:  # Support for education spending is "yes"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Education spending is "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Duty-free exports is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    # Return the final prediction and truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Use

To make a prediction, provide a dictionary (`X`) containing the feature values. For example:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

# Predict party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction (party affiliation):", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output Example

For the input provided above, the output might be:

```
Prediction (party affiliation): Democrat
Truth values of inner nodes: [True, False, True, True]
```

### Explanation
- The `nodes` list shows the truth evaluation (1 for True, 0 for False) of each condition in the decision tree.
- The final output (`prediction`) gives the classification as either 1 (Republican) or 0 (Democrat).
