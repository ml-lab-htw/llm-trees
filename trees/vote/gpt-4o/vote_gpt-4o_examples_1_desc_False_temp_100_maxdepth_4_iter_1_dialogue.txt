Here's the Python function for the decision tree we constructed above. It includes meaningful decision thresholds (derived from the feature encodings you provided). The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys correspond to the exact features provided, and it returns the predicted party affiliation (`1 = Republican`, `0 = Democrat`) along with a list of the truth values of the internal nodes in the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Internal node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # Yes to physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2      # Yes to aid to El Salvador
    nodes[2] = X["crime"] == 2                # Yes to crime vote
    nodes[3] = X["duty free exports"] == 2    # Yes to duty-free exports

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Physician fee freeze == Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # El Salvador aid == Yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Crime == Yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Crime == No
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # El Salvador aid == No
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Physician fee freeze == No
        if nodes[3]:  # Duty-free exports == Yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Crime == Yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Crime == No
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Duty-free exports == No
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Initialization of Nodes**:  
   - The `nodes` list holds the truth values of the internal nodes, based on the input features' values from `X`. Each node corresponds to one of the decision tree's conditions.

2. **Conditions in Nodes**:  
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the vote on *physician fee freeze* was "yes" (`2 = yes`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the vote on *aid to El Salvador* was "yes" (`2 = yes`).
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the vote on *crime* was "yes" (`2 = yes`).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the vote on *duty-free exports* was "yes" (`2 = yes`).

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:  
   - The nested `if` statements follow the structure of the decision tree, evaluating conditions in the correct order to classify input values as either `1 = Republican` or `0 = Democrat`.

4. **Output**:  
   - The function returns two values:
     - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1 = Republican`, `0 = Democrat`).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1 = True`, `0 = False`) indicating whether each node's condition was satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 1,
    "water project cost sharing": 2,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 2,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction (Party Affiliation):", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes (Truth Values):", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the input dictionary `X` above, the truth table for the nodes and the prediction might look like:
```plaintext
Prediction (Party Affiliation): Republican
Nodes (Truth Values): [1, 1, 1, 0]
```

This would indicate:
- The input satisfies the first three conditions of the tree (`nodes[0]`, `nodes[1]`, `nodes[2]` are `1` or `True`).
- The last condition (`nodes[3]`) is not satisfied (`0` or `False`).
