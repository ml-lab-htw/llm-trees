Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the given features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5      # 1 = no, 2 = yes

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # "physician fee freeze" is no
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "physician fee freeze" is yes
        if nodes[1]:  # "el salvador aid" is no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "el salvador aid" is yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`, `"el salvador aid"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values (e.g., 1 for "no", 2 for "yes").
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the value of `"physician fee freeze"` is less than or equal to 1.5 (i.e., "no").
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the value of `"el salvador aid"` is less than or equal to 1.5 (i.e., "no").
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If the first condition (`nodes[0]`) is satisfied (i.e., `"physician fee freeze"` is "no"), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
   - Otherwise, the second condition (`nodes[1]`) is evaluated:
     - If `"el salvador aid"` is "no", the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
     - If `"el salvador aid"` is "yes", the prediction is `1` (Republican).
4. **Output**: The function returns a tuple:
   - The first element is the prediction (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).
   - The second element is the list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the given input `X`:
- `"physician fee freeze"` is `2` (yes).
- `"el salvador aid"` is `1` (no).

The output will be:
```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [False, True]
```

This means:
- The first condition (`"physician fee freeze" <= 1.5`) is `False` (not satisfied).
- The second condition (`"el salvador aid" <= 1.5`) is `True` (satisfied).
- The final prediction is `Democrat`.
