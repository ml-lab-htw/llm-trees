Let's construct the decision tree prediction function for your task. The function will take an input dictionary representing the feature values, calculate the truth values of each inner node, and return both the prediction and the list of truth values for the nodes.

The features are as follows:
- `handicapped infants`, `water project cost sharing`, `adoption of the budget resolution`, `physician fee freeze`, `el salvador aid`, `religious groups in schools`, `anti satellite test ban`, `aid to nicaraguan contras`, `mx missile`, `immigration`, `synfuels corporation cutback`, `education spending`, `superfund right to sue`, `crime`, `duty free exports`, `export administration act south africa`.

The target variable is encoded as:
- `party affiliation`: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat.

Hereâ€™s the function implementation based on your decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the conditions (inner nodes)
    nodes = [None] * 7

    # Define the decisions in the tree as truth values
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # Root node: aid to nicaraguan contras == no
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Physician fee freeze == no
    nodes[2] = X["mx missile"] == 1  # MX missile == no
    nodes[3] = X["education spending"] == 1  # Education spending == no
    nodes[4] = X["crime"] == 1  # Crime == yes

    # Start decision making based on the truth values
    if nodes[0]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras == no
        if nodes[1]:  # physician fee freeze == no
            if nodes[2]:  # MX missile == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # MX missile == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # physician fee freeze == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras == yes
        if nodes[3]:  # education spending == no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending == yes
            if nodes[4]:  # crime == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # crime == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Return the prediction and the list of truth values
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Note:
To adapt this decision tree to new thresholds or nodes, update the `nodes` logic and conditions in the `predict` function. The function is modular and can be easily extended for more complex decision trees.
