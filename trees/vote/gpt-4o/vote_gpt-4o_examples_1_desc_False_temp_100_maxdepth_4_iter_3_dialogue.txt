Here is the Python implementation of your 4-depth decision tree using the given feature names, encodings, and target variable, formatted as a function as per your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation (Democrat/Republican) based on voting features.

    Input:
    - X (dict): Feature dictionary with the exact keys:
      ['handicapped infants', 'water project cost sharing', 'adoption of the budget resolution',
       'physician fee freeze', 'el salvador aid', 'religious groups in schools', 'anti satellite test ban',
       'aid to nicaraguan contras', 'mx missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels corporation cutback',
       'education spending', 'superfund right to sue', 'crime', 'duty free exports',
       'export administration act south africa']
      Values should be integers (1 or 2) as specified in the feature encoding.

    Returns:
    - prediction (int): `1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat
    - nodes (list): List of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """

    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 1  # Democrat if aid to contras is opposed (No = 1)
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 1       # Democrat if fee freeze is opposed (No = 1)
    nodes[2] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2  # Republican if budget resolution is supported (Yes = 2)
    nodes[3] = X['duty free exports'] == 2          # Republican if duty-free exports are supported (Yes = 2)

    # Traversing the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # 'aid to nicaraguan contras' == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # 'physician fee freeze' == 1
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # 'physician fee freeze' == 2
            if nodes[2]:  # 'adoption of the budget resolution' == 2
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # 'aid to nicaraguan contras' == 2
        if nodes[3]:  # 'duty free exports' == 2
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if X['anti satellite test ban'] == 1:  # Democrat if anti-satellite test ban is opposed (No = 1)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Input**:
   - `X` is a dictionary where keys are the exact feature names you provided (e.g., `'aid to nicaraguan contras'`) and values are integers representing votes (`1 = No`, `2 = Yes`).

2. **Nodes**:
   - The `nodes` list represents the evaluation of four decision nodes in the tree. Each element in the list is `1` if the corresponding condition is satisfied, otherwise `0`.

3. **Tree Logic**:
   - The decision tree is based on logical splits of the features, designed to classify "party affiliation."
   - Each condition reflects the splits in the decision tree:
     - `nodes[0]`: Split based on "aid to nicaraguan contras."
     - `nodes[1]`: Split based on "physician fee freeze."
     - `nodes[2]`: Split based on "adoption of the budget resolution."
     - `nodes[3]`: Split based on "duty free exports."

4. **Traverse the Tree**:
   - The function navigates through nested `if-else` blocks to simulate the decision tree traversal.

5. **Output**:
   - It returns the predicted class (`1 = Republican`, `0 = Democrat`) and the list of truth values (`nodes`).

### Example Input and Output:

#### Example 1:
Input:
```python
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}
```

Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print(nodes)       # Output: [1, 1, False, False]
```

#### Example 2:
Input:
```python
X = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 2,
