Sure! Let's go ahead and define the function based on the decision tree we created. I'll use the `adoption of the budget resolution`, `el salvador aid`, and `physician fee freeze` as the key features to split on.

Here is the function implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2 if nodes[0] else X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If "Vote on adoption of the budget resolution" is "yes"
        if nodes[1]:  # If "Vote on aid to El Salvador" is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If "Vote on aid to El Salvador" is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If "Vote on adoption of the budget resolution" is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # If "Vote on physician fee freeze" is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If "Vote on physician fee freeze" is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1: Initialization of nodes** - `nodes` list is initialized to hold the truth values of the inner nodes.
- **Step 2**:
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the "adoption of the budget resolution" vote is "yes" (encoded as `2`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Conditional on `nodes[0]`, it checks either "el salvador aid" (if `nodes[0]` is True) or "physician fee freeze" (if `nodes[0]` is False).
- **Step 3**:
  - The nested if-else statements determine the final prediction based on the truth values stored in `nodes`.
  
The function returns both the prediction and the truth values of the nodes, providing insight into the decision-making process of the tree. This helps in both debugging and understanding the logic behind the classification.
