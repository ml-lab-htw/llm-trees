Based on the given constraints and examples, here is a Python function that predicts the party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) using the provided features and returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Number of inner nodes in the decision tree

    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["mx missile"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2
    nodes[5] = X["education spending"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # adoption of the budget resolution (yes)
        if nodes[1]:  # anti satellite test ban (yes)
            if nodes[2]:  # mx missile (yes)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # mx missile (no)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # anti satellite test ban (no)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # adoption of the budget resolution (no)
        if nodes[3]:  # physician fee freeze (yes)
            if nodes[4]:  # el salvador aid (yes)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # el salvador aid (no)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # physician fee freeze (no)
            if nodes[5]:  # education spending (yes)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # education spending (no)
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'handicapped infants': 2, 'water project cost sharing': 1, 'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1, 'el salvador aid': 2, 'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1, 'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1, 'mx missile': 2, 'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1, 'education spending': 2, 'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 1, 'duty free exports': 1, 'export administration act south africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

In this function:

- `nodes` list stores the truth value of each condition in the internal nodes.
- Conditions are checked sequentially, mirroring the structure of the decision tree.
- The function returns the prediction and the list of truth values for internal nodes.

Feel free to modify the conditions and structure of the function based on more accurate feature importance if you have actual training data and a trained decision tree model.
