### Decision Tree Classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # To store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Inner node 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no)
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # 'no' vote

    if nodes[0]:
        # If "Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras" is 'no'
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # If "Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras" is 'yes'
        # Inner node 2: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no)
        nodes[1] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1  # 'no' vote

        if nodes[1]:
            # If "Vote on adoption of the budget resolution" is 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # If "Vote on adoption of the budget resolution" is 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
# X = {
#     "handicapped infants": 1,
#     "water project cost sharing": 1,
#     "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
#     "physician fee freeze": 2,
#     "el salvador aid": 2,
#     "religious groups in schools": 2,
#     "anti satellite test ban": 2,
#     "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
#     "mx missile": 2,
#     "immigration": 2,
#     "synfuels corporation cutback": 2,
#     "education spending": 2,
#     "superfund right to sue": 2,
#     "crime": 2,
#     "duty free exports": 2,
#     "export administration act south africa": 2
# }

# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output should be the party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)
# print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output should be the list of inner node truth values
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Nodes List**:
   - The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes. In this case, it has been initialized with two `None` values, corresponding to the two splits in the tree.
   
2. **First Split**:
   - The first condition checks whether the "aid to Nicaraguan contras" vote is 'no' (encoded as `1`). If this condition is satisfied, the nodes[0] is set to `True`, and the prediction is 'Democrat' (encoded as `0`).

3. **Second Split**:
   - If the first condition is not satisfied (i.e., "aid to Nicaraguan contras" vote is 'yes'), it moves to the second condition which checks whether the "adoption of the budget resolution" vote is 'no' (encoded as `1`). If this condition is satisfied, nodes[1] is set to `True`, and the prediction is 'Democrat' (encoded as `0`).
   - If the second condition is not satisfied (i.e., "adoption of the budget resolution" vote is 'yes'), the prediction is 'Republican' (encoded as `1`).

This function can be used to predict the party affiliation based on the provided features and also return the truth values of the conditions checked within the decision tree.
