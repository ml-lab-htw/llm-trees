Using your detailed description of the dataset and the target variable encoding, here's a Python function for the requested depth-3 decision tree that predicts party affiliation and provides a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree classifier to predict party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values with specified keys.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
        nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied)
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    # Decision tree nodes
    nodes[0] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1  # Vote against adoption of the budget resolution
    nodes[1] = X["mx missile"] == 1  # Vote against the MX missile
    nodes[2] = X["immigration"] == 2  # Vote in favor of immigration

    if nodes[0]:  # Did not adopt the budget resolution
        if nodes[1]:  # Did not support the MX missile
            prediction = 0  # Predicted as Democrat
        else:  # Supported the MX missile
            if nodes[2]:  # Supported immigration
                prediction = 0  # Predicted as Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Predicted as Republican
    else:  # Adopted the budget resolution
        if X["el salvador aid"] == 1:  # Did not support aid to El Salvador
            prediction = 0  # Predicted as Democrat
        else:  # Supported aid to El Salvador
            if X["crime"] == 2:  # Supported crime-related legislation
                prediction = 1  # Predicted as Republican
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Predicted as Republican

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree
1. **Node 1** (`adoption of the budget resolution`):
   - If `adoption of the budget resolution` is "no" (`== 1`), move to the next feature (`mx missile`).
   - Otherwise, continue with the feature (`el salvador aid`).

2. **Node 2** (`mx missile`):
   - If `mx missile` is "no" (`== 1`), predict Democrat (`0`).
   - If `mx missile` is "yes" (`== 2`), consider the next feature (`immigration`).

3. **Node 3** (`immigration`):
   - If `immigration` is "yes" (`== 2`), predict Democrat (`0`).
   - Otherwise, predict Republican (`1`).

4. If the budget resolution was adopted in the first node:
   - Check the feature `el salvador aid`.
   - Depending on support for aid to El Salvador and positions on `crime`, classify the input.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use this function:

```python
# Define input features
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 1,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 1,
    "anti satellite test ban": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 2,
    "export administration act south africa": 1,
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (or 1 depending on input)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [1, 1, 0] (Example truth table)
```

This function uses the input `X`, compares the values to decision thresholds, and outputs the prediction and the truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree. Make sure to pass properly encoded feature values as specified in the dataset description!
