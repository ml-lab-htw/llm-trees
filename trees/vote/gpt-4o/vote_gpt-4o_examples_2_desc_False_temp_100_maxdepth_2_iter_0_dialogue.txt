Sure, let's create a `predict` function for the decision tree described earlier. Hereâ€™s the function that checks votes on the issues of "aid to El Salvador" and "physician fee freeze", and outputs predictions along with the truth values of inner nodes.

### Python Function (Decision Tree with Depth 2)

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First inner node: Check the vote on 'el salvador aid'
    nodes[0] = X['el salvador aid'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # If 'el salvador aid' is yes
        prediction = 1  # republican
    else:  # If 'el salvador aid' is no
        # Second inner node: Check the vote on 'physician fee freeze'
        nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2

        if nodes[1]:  # If 'physician fee freeze' is yes
            prediction = 0  # democrat
        else:  # If 'physician fee freeze' is no
            prediction = 1  # republican

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
# Define a feature dict
example_features = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,  # yes
    'el salvador aid': 1,  # no
    'religious groups in schools': 1,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f'Prediction: {prediction}')  # Output: 0 (democrat) or 1 (republican)
print(f'Nodes: {nodes}')  # Output: [0, 1] based on feature dict
```

### Explanation:
- `nodes[0]`: This checks whether the vote on "el salvador aid" is `yes (2)`. If true, it assigns `1` (Republican) to `prediction`.
- If `nodes[0]` is `False`, we proceed to `nodes[1]` which checks whether the vote on "physician fee freeze" is `yes (2)`. 
  - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, then `prediction` is `0` (Democrat).
  - If `nodes[1]` is `False`, then `prediction` is `1` (Republican).

The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes to reflect which decisions were made at each split in the tree.

### Example Usage:
- Given the `example_features` where `physician fee freeze` is `yes` (2) and `el salvador aid` is `no` (1), the prediction will be `0` (Democrat) and the inner nodes' list will be `[False, True]` corresponding to these evaluations.
