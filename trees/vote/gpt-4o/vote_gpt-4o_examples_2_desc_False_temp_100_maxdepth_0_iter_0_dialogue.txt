Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the provided features. The function returns a single prediction as well as a list of Boolean values indicating the truth of each node's condition.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    # Mapping the string conditions to boolean comparisons
    nodes[0] = X["handicapped infants"] == 1  # Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # Vote on physician fee freeze (1 = no)
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (1 = no)
    nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (1 = no)
    nodes[4] = X["synfuels corporation cutback"] == 1  # Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (1 = no)
    
    # Root of the tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    # Converting nodes conditions to 1 or 0 instead of True or False
    nodes = [1 if node else 0 for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 2,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 1,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes_truth_values = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes_truth_values}")
```

### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` where each key is a feature name and its value is the corresponding vote (encoded as described).
- The list `nodes` stores the results of the comparison corresponding to each decision node in the tree.
- The conditions for each node follow the decision tree structure provided:
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the vote on the issue of handicapped infants is 'no' (1).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (1).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'no' (1).
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'no' (1).
  - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the vote on synfuels corporation cutback is 'no' (1).
- Based on the results of these tests, the function navigates through the decision tree to arrive at a prediction.
- The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list of Boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (converted to 1 or 0).

You can modify the conditions and logic if additional nodes or features are to be considered.
