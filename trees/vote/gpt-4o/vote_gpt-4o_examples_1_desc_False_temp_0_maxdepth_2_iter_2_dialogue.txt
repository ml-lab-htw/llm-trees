Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the vote on 'physician fee freeze'
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If 'physician fee freeze' vote is "no"
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If 'physician fee freeze' vote is "yes"
        # Node 1: Check the vote on 'el salvador aid'
        nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If 'el salvador aid' vote is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If 'el salvador aid' vote is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician fee freeze"`, `"el salvador aid"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values (e.g., `1` for "no", `2` for "yes").
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1`.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `X["el salvador aid"] <= 1`.
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If the vote on `"physician fee freeze"` is "no" (`<= 1`), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
   - If the vote on `"physician fee freeze"` is "yes" (`> 1`), the function checks the vote on `"el salvador aid"`.
     - If the vote on `"el salvador aid"` is "no" (`<= 1`), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
     - If the vote on `"el salvador aid"` is "yes" (`> 1`), the prediction is `1` (Republican).
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "el salvador aid": 1,
    "religious groups in schools": 2,
    "anti satellite test ban": 1,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "mx missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels corporation cutback": 1,
    "education spending": 2,
    "superfund right to sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty free exports": 1,
    "export administration act south africa": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat) or 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, False] or similar based on the input
```

### Example Output:
For the input above:
- `"physician fee freeze"` is `2` (yes), so `nodes[0] = False`.
- `"el salvador aid"` is `1` (no), so `nodes[1] = True`.
- The prediction is `0` (Democrat).

Output:
```
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [False, True]
```
