Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on the "Vote on physician fee freeze" feature. The function returns the prediction and a list of truth values corresponding to the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to hold truth values for inner nodes 
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Check the condition for the first (and only) inner node
    # We use "Vote on physician fee freeze" feature
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # True if 'no' (1), False if 'yes' (2)
    
    # Make prediction based on the value of the root node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Class 0 (Democrat)
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Class 1 (Republican)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. Input:
   - The function takes one argument, `X`, which is a dictionary where keys represent feature names and values represent the feature values for a single data point.

2. Inner Node Condition:
   - The decision tree uses the "Vote on physician fee freeze" feature. 
   - A threshold of `1.5` is used to determine the outcome:
     - If the value is `<= 1.5` (i.e., the vote is "no" or encoded as `1`), the condition is **True**.
     - If the value is `> 1.5` (i.e., the vote is "yes" or encoded as `2`), the condition is **False**.
   - This condition is stored in the `nodes` list.

3. Prediction:
   - If the condition at the inner node is `True`, the individual is classified as a **Democrat (0)**.
   - Otherwise, the individual is classified as a **Republican (1)**.

4. Output:
   - The function returns two outputs:
     - `prediction`: The classification result (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes. Since the tree has only one inner node, this list contains a single value.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Test example
X_sample = {
    'handicapped infants': 1,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,  # 'no'
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 2,
    'education spending': 1,
    'superfund right to sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty free exports': 2,
    'export administration act south africa': 1
}

# Predict party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction (0=Democrat, 1=Republican):", prediction)
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the above example, where "Vote on physician fee freeze" is `1`, the function would output:
```
Prediction (0=Democrat, 1=Republican): 0
Truth values of inner nodes: [True]
```
