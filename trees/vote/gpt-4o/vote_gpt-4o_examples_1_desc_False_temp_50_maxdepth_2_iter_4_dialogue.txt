Here is the Python function for the decision tree you provided, formatted as requested. It uses the features and target variable as described, and it returns a single prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the provided features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 'physician fee freeze' (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        - 'el salvador aid' (2 = yes, 1 = no)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
        - nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    # Initialize the list of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Evaluate the conditions for the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # First split: "physician fee freeze" = no
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1       # Second split: "el salvador aid" = no

    # Make predictions based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # "physician fee freeze" = no
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "physician fee freeze" = yes
        if nodes[1]:  # "el salvador aid" = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "el salvador aid" = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
```python
# Example input
features = {
    "physician fee freeze": 1,  # no
    "el salvador aid": 2        # yes
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output
For the input:
```python
features = {
    "physician fee freeze": 1,  # no
    "el salvador aid": 2        # yes
}
```

The output will be:
```
Prediction: Democrat
Inner node truth values: [True, False]
```

### Explanation of the Function
1. **Inner Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the "physician fee freeze" vote is `no` (`1`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the "el salvador aid" vote is `no` (`1`).

2. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., "physician fee freeze" = `no`), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
   - Otherwise, the function evaluates `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True` (i.e., "el salvador aid" = `no`), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
     - Otherwise, the prediction is `1` (Republican).

This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 and adheres to the specified format.
