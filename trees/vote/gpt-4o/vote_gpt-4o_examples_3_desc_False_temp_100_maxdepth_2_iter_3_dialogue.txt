Here is a Python function that models the provided decision tree for classifying party affiliation. Given the constraints and encoding of features, the function will use the keys exactly as specified and output the desired prediction as well as the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # List to store evaluation of inner nodes
    
    # Evaluate conditions for nodes
    nodes[0] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 1
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Sample input: {'adoption of the budget resolution': 2, 'physician fee freeze': 1, ...}
# Corresponds to adoption of the budget resolution: yes (2), physician fee freeze: no (1)

input_data = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 1,
    'physician fee freeze': 2,
    'el salvador aid': 1,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(input_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 1`
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `X['physician fee freeze'] == 1`

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If the vote on the adoption of the budget resolution is "no" (`1`), then classify as Republican (`prediction = 1`)
  - If the vote on the adoption of the budget resolution is "yes" (`2`), then check the vote on the physician fee freeze.
  - If the vote on physician fee freeze is "no" (`1`), classify as Democrat (`prediction = 0`)
  - If the vote on physician fee freeze is "yes" (`2`), classify as Republican (`prediction = 1`)

The given `input_data` can be customized as per the actual voting data to get the corresponding prediction and truth values for the nodes.
