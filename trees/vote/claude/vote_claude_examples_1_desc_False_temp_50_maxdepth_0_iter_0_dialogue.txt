Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Node 1: Vote on aid to nicaraguan contras
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Node 2: Vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Node 3: Vote on anti satellite test ban
    nodes[3] = X["anti satellite test ban"] == 2  # 2 = yes

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each decision node based on the corresponding feature:
   - Node 0: "physician fee freeze"
   - Node 1: "aid to nicaraguan contras"
   - Node 2: "education spending"
   - Node 3: "anti satellite test ban"

4. It then follows the decision tree structure to make a prediction:
   - If "physician fee freeze" is yes (2), predict Republican (1)
   - Otherwise, check "aid to nicaraguan contras"
     - If yes (2), predict Republican (1)
     - Otherwise, check "education spending"
       - If yes (2), predict
