Based on the provided feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat), I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the encoding where 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1    # Voting no on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1      # Voting no on education spending
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Uses the actual encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no) to create appropriate conditions
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node results

The logic follows typical party-line voting patterns where:
- Republicans are more likely to vote no on both physician fee freeze and education spending
- Democrats are more likely to vote yes on either or both issues
