Based on the provided feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat), here's the Python function for the decision tree I proposed:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1    # 'no' vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1    # 'no' vote on aid to nicaraguan contras
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if 'no' on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if 'no' on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if 'yes' on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting record
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth values of the conditions
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node: Whether the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (≤1)
   - Second node: Whether the vote on aid to nicaraguan contras is 'no' (≤1)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions

The decision logic follows the tree structure:
- If voted 'no' on physician fee freeze AND 'no' on nicaraguan contras → Democrat (0)
- If voted 'no' on physician fee freeze AND 'yes' on nicaraguan contras → Republican (1)
- If voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze → Republican (1)
