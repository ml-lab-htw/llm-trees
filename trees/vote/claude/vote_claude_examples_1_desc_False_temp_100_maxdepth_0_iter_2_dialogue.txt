Based on the provided feature names and encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no), here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [
        X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1,
        X["education spending"] > 1
    ]

    prediction = 0 if nodes[0] and nodes[1] else 1 if nodes[0] else 0

    return prediction, nodes

```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with the feature names as keys and their values (1 = no, 2 = yes)
- Returns a tuple containing:
  - prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
  - list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Implements the decision tree logic based on typical voting patterns
- Uses the correct encoding where 2 = yes and 1 = no
