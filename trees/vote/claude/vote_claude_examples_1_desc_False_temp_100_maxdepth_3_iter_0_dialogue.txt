Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to use the 1/2 encoding from the feature description
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no
    nodes[1] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] <= 1  # 1 = no
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1  # 1 = no
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if voted no on budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # if voted yes on budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # if voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # if voted no on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if voted yes on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the binary decisions
3. Uses the actual feature encoding (1 = no, 2 = yes) from the description
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node decisions

The tree uses three key votes that were typically partisan issues:
- Physician fee freeze
- Budget resolution
- Aid to Nicaraguan contras

The conditions are structured to match the original encoding where:
- 1 = "no" vote
- 2 = "yes" vote

The prediction values match the target encoding where:
- 0 = Democrat
- 1 = Republican
