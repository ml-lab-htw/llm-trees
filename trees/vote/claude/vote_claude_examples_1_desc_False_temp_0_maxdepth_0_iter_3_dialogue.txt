Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I suggested earlier, here's a Python function that predicts party affiliation and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert 'yes' votes (2) to True, 'no' votes (1) to False
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2
    nodes[2] = X['education spending'] == 2
    nodes[3] = X['mx missile'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the voting records.
2. We initialize a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. Each node checks a specific voting issue, converting the vote to a boolean (True for 'yes' (2), False for 'no' (1)).
4. The tree structure follows the decision path I outlined earlier:
   - First check is on 'aid to nicaraguan contras'
   - If that's a 'no', we check 'physician fee freeze'
   - If that's also 'no', we check 'education spending'
   - If that's 'no', we finally check 'mx missile'
5. The prediction is 1 for Republican and 0 for Democrat, matching the provided encoding.
6. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This function provides a simplified model based on key voting issues. In a real-world scenario, you might want to use more features and a more complex tree structure for higher accuracy.
