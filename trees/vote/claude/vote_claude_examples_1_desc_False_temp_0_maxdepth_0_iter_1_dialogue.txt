Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert 'yes' (2) to True and 'no' (1) to False for easier comparison
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes (2 for 'yes', 1 for 'no').

2. It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each condition in the decision tree, storing the result (True or False) in the `nodes` list.

4. It then uses these evaluations to traverse the decision tree and make a prediction.

5. The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This implementation follows the decision tree structure we discussed earlier, using the exact feature names provided and the correct encoding for votes (2 for 'yes', 1 for 'no') and party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
