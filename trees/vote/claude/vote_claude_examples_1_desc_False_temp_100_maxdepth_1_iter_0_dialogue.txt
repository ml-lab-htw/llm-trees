Based on the decision tree I proposed and the provided feature encoding, here's the Python function that implements the tree and returns both the prediction and the node truth values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Using 1.5 as threshold since 1 = no and 2 = yes
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the single decision node
3. Evaluates if the "physician fee freeze" vote is <= 1.5 (effectively separating "no" (1) from "yes" (2) votes)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The threshold of 1.5 is chosen because:
- A vote of "no" is encoded as 1
- A vote of "yes" is encoded as 2
- 1.5 is the midpoint that separates these two values

Note that according to the provided encoding:
- Party affiliation: 0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican
- Votes: 1 = no, 2 = yes
