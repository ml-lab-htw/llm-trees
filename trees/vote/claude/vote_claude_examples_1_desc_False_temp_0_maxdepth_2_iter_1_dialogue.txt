Based on the provided feature encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # 'no' vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1  # 'no' vote on nicaraguan contras
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if 'no' on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if 'no' on aid to nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if 'yes' on aid to nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting record
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth values of the conditions
3. Evaluates two key votes:
   - First split on "physician fee freeze"
   - Second split on "aid to nicaraguan contras"
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The conditions are based on the encoding where:
- 2 = yes vote
- 1 = no vote

Therefore:
- `<= 1` means a 'no' vote
- `> 1` means a 'yes' vote
