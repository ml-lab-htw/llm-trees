Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using the 'physician fee freeze' feature as the splitting criterion. Since the encoding is 2 = yes and 1 = no, I'll adjust the threshold accordingly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between 1 (no) and 2 (yes)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If vote is "no" (â‰¤ 1.5)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If vote is "yes" (> 1.5)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the decision condition
3. Evaluates if the 'physician fee freeze' vote is <= 1.5 (effectively splitting between "no" (1) and "yes" (2))
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
   - nodes: list containing the boolean result of the decision condition

A vote of "no" (1) on physician fee freeze predicts Democrat (0), while a vote of "yes" (2) predicts Republican (1).
