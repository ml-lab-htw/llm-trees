Based on the provided feature encodings (2 = yes, 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat), here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # voted no on el salvador aid
            prediction = 0  # democrat
        else:  # voted yes on el salvador aid
            prediction = 1  # republican
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
- Uses the threshold 1.5 to split between 'yes' (2) and 'no' (1) votes
- Returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of boolean values representing the condition results at each node
- Uses the exact feature names as provided in the list
- Implements the same tree structure as previously described, but adapted to the actual encoding scheme where 2 = yes and 1 = no
