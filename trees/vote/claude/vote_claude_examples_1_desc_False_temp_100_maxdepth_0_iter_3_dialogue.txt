Based on the provided feature names and encoding (where 2 = yes, 1 = no for votes), here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    def voted_no_on_physician_fee_freeze(vote):
        return vote <= 1

    def voted_yes_on_education_spending(vote):
        return vote > 1

    nodes = [
        voted_no_on_physician_fee_freeze(X["physician fee freeze"]),
        voted_yes_on_education_spending(X["education spending"])
    ]

    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    elif nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition considering the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the same structure as the decision tree I provided earlier, but with proper encodings

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats typically voted yes on physician fee freeze and budget resolution
- Democrats typically supported education spending but opposed aid to Nicaraguan contras
- Republicans typically had opposite voting patterns on these issues
