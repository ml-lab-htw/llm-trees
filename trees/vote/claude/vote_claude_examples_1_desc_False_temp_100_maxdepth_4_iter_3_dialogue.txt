Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node truth values. I'll use the voting features with their correct encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions using the exact feature names and proper encoding
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # no vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 1    # no vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # no vote on nicaraguan contras
    nodes[3] = X["el salvador aid"] == 1       # no vote on el salvador aid

    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending = no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending = yes
            if nodes[3]:  # el salvador aid = no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # el salvador aid = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[2]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = yes
            if nodes[3]:  # el salvador aid = no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # el salvador aid = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the vote on physician fee freeze
2. Then branches based on education spending or nicaraguan contras aid
3. Uses el salvador aid as a final discriminator
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values

The conditions use == 1 to check for "no" votes since that's more discriminating for party affiliation in this context. The function handles the exact feature names as provided in the dataset and uses the correct encoding where 2 = yes an
