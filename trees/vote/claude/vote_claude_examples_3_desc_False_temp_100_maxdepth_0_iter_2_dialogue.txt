I still need training data to build a realistic decision tree.  However, I can demonstrate the format of the Python function using a hypothetical decision tree based on the Congressional voting data features you provided. Let's assume, for the sake of this example, that "physician fee freeze" and "aid to nicaraguan contras" are the most important features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 means 'yes'
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2 # 2 means 'yes'

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on aid to nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted no on aid to nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    # ... other features
    "physician fee freeze": 2,
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 1,
    # ... other features
    "export administration act south africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` list:** This list stores the truth values of the conditions at each node.  `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first split ("physician fee freeze"), and `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second split ("aid to nicaraguan contras").  `True` indicates the condition is met, and `False` indicates it's not.

2. **Conditions:**  The conditions use `X["feature_name"] == 2` to check if the vote was "yes" (encoded as 2).

3. **Prediction:** The `prediction` variable stores the final classification (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).

4. **Example Usage:**  The example shows how to call the function with a dictionary representing the input features.


**Important:**  This is a *simplified example*. A real decision tree learned from data could be much more complex, involving more features and deeper branching.  The structure and conditions of the tree entirely depend on the training data.  Provide me with training data, and I can generate a more realistic and accurate `predict` function.
