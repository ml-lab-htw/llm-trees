Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encoding, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values.

2. It creates a list `nodes` of length 2 to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "aid to nicaraguan contras" is yes (2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on "physician fee freeze" is yes (2).

5. It then uses these conditions to determine the party affiliation:
   - If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is yes, it predicts Republican (1).
   - If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is no, it checks the vote on physician fee freeze:
     - If the vote on physician fee freeze is yes, it predicts Republican (1).
     - If the vote on physician fee freeze is no, it predicts Democrat (0).

6. Finally, it returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This function accurately represents the decision tree I described earlier, using the correct feature names and encodings provided.
