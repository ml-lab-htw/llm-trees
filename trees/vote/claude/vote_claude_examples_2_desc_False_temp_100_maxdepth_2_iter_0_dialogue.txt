Based on the provided information and the request to format the decision tree as a Python function, here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The decision tree uses three features:
   - "physician fee freeze"
   - "el salvador aid"
   - "adoption of the budget resolution"

4. We use 1.5 as the threshold for all features because the encoding is 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no". A value <= 1.5 means "no", while > 1.5 means "yes".

5. The tree structure follows the earlier description:
   - First, it checks the "physician fee freeze" vote.
   - If it's "no" (<=1.5), it then checks the "el salvador aid" vote.
   - If it's "yes" (>1.5), it checks the "adoption of the budget resolution" vote.

6. The prediction is 0 for Democrat and 1 for Republican, matching the target variable encoding you provided.

7. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation correctly follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, uses the proper feature names and encodings, and returns the prediction in the format you specified (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
