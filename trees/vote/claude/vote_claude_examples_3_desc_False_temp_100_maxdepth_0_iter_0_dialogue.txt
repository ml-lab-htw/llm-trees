You're still referencing features like "petal_length" and "sepal_width" from the Iris dataset in your example code, but we're working with Congressional voting data. Let's correct that and create a Python function based on the voting features.

Because I don't have actual data to train a real decision tree, I'll create a *demonstration* function.  This function will use a simplified, hypothetical decision tree based on a few key votes.  *You would replace this with a tree learned from real data.*

```python
def predict_party(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

    Args:
        X: A dictionary of voting records where keys are feature names
           (e.g., 'handicapped infants', 'aid to nicaraguan contras')
           and values are 2 for 'yes' and 1 for 'no'.

    Returns:
        A tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction: Predicted party (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
        - nodes: A list representing the truth values of inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Hypothetical decision tree based on "contras" and "budget" votes.
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # Contras aid = yes?
    nodes[1] = X['adoption of the budget resolution'] == 2 # Budget resolution = yes?
    nodes[2] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2 # physician fee freeze = yes?

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on Contras aid
        if nodes[1]: # and voted yes on Budget Resolution
          prediction = 1 # Republican
        else: # voted no on budget resolution
          prediction = 0 # Democrat
    else:  # Voted no on Contras aid
        if nodes[2]: # yes on physician fee freeze
          prediction = 1 # Republican
        else: # no on physician fee freeze
          prediction = 0 # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage
example_vote = {
    'handicapped infants': 2,
    'water project cost sharing': 1,
    'adoption of the budget resolution': 2,
    'physician fee freeze': 1,
    'el salvador aid': 2,
    'religious groups in schools': 2,
    'anti satellite test ban': 1,
    'aid to nicaraguan contras': 2,
    'mx missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels corporation cutback': 1,
    'education spending': 2,
    'superfund right to sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty free exports': 1,
    'export administration act south africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1=Republican, 0=Democrat)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")


```



**Explanation and Next Steps:**

1. **Hypothetical Tree:** The `predict_party` function uses a *made-up* decision tree.  It's crucial to replace this with a tree learned from your data.

2. **Node Logic:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node. These are then used to traverse the tree and make a prediction.

3. **Real-World Application:** To create a practical model, you *must* train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` (from `scikit-learn`) using your actual voting data.  The code I provided earlier demonstrates how to do this.  Once you've trained the classifier, you can extract the tree structure and thresholds to create a function similar to `predict_party`, but based on the learned tree.  The `sklearn.tree.export_text` function can be helpful for understanding the structure of the trained tree.


This revised answer provides a functional example and clarifies the important next steps for building a real-world prediction function.  Let me know if you have the data, and I can help you train the model and create the final prediction function.
