Based on the provided feature encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Converting the conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] > 1.5  # voting yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] > 1.5    # voting yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["water project cost sharing"] > 1.5  # voting yes on water project
    nodes[3] = X["el salvador aid"] > 1.5       # voting yes on El Salvador aid
    nodes[4] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] > 1.5  # voting yes on budget

    if nodes[0]:  # yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # yes on education spending
            if nodes[4]:  # yes on budget resolution
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # yes on water project
            if nodes[3]:  # yes on El Salvador aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # no on water project
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the vote on physician fee freeze
2. Then branches based on education spending or water project cost sharing
3. Further refines based on El Salvador aid and budget resolution votes

The tree captures typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats tend to vote no on physician fee freeze
- Republicans tend to vote yes on physician fee freeze and no on education spending
- The combination of votes helps identify more nuanced party affiliations

The function returns both:
1. The predicted party affiliation (1
