Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the additional information you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. The first node checks if the vote on "physician fee freeze" is yes (2).

3. The second node checks if the vote on "el salvador aid" is yes (2).

4. If the vote on "physician fee freeze" is yes, it predicts Republican (1).

5. If the vote on "physician fee freeze" is no, it checks the vote on "el salvador aid":
   - If "el salvador aid" is yes, it predicts Republican (1).
   - If "el salvador aid" is no, it predicts Democrat (0).

6. The function returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you specified. The tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the two features that are likely to be most discriminative for party affiliation based on typical voting patterns.
