Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the 'physician fee freeze' and 'aid to nicaraguan contras' features, with the correct encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    
    # Second split: aid to nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if physician fee freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # if aid to nicaraguan contras is "no" (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if aid to nicaraguan contras is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if physician fee freeze is "yes" (2)
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean results of each split
3. First checks if "physician fee freeze" vote is "no" (â‰¤1.5 splits between 1 and 2)
4. If "physician fee freeze" is "no", then checks if "aid to nicaraguan contras" vote is "no"
5. Makes predictions:
   - If both votes are "no": predicts Democrat (0)
   - If "physician fee freeze" is "no" but "aid to nicaraguan contras" is "yes": predicts Republican (1)
   - If "physician fee freeze" is "yes": predicts Republican (1)
6. Returns both the prediction and the node values

The thresholds (1.5) are set to split between "no" (1) and "yes"
