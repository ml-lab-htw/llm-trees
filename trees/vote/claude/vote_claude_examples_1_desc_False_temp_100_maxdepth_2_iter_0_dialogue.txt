Based on the provided feature encodings (2 = yes, 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat), here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # If vote is 'no' (1)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5    # If vote is 'no' (1)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If 'no' on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If 'no' on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If 'yes' on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds are set to 1.5 because:
- The features are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no)
- 1.5 is the midpoint that separates these values
- X[feature] <= 1.5 will be True for 'no' votes (1) and False for 'yes' votes (2)

This implements the same logic as the previous tree but adapted to the specific encoding scheme provided:
- If someone votes 'no' on physician fee freeze and 'no' on education spending, they're predicted to be Republican (1)
- If someone votes 'no' on physician fee freeze and 'yes' on education spending, they're predicted to be Democrat (0)
- If someone votes 'yes' on physician fee freeze, they're predicted to be Democrat (0)
