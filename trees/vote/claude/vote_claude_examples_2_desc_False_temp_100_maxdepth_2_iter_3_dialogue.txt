Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the information you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. The first node checks if the vote on "aid to nicaraguan contras" is yes (2).

3. The second node checks if the vote on "education spending" is yes (2).

4. If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is yes, it predicts Republican (1).

5. If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is no, it checks the vote on education spending:
   - If it's yes, it predicts Democrat (0).
   - If it's no, it predicts Republican (1).

6. The function returns the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the decision tree structure we discussed earlier and uses the correct feature keys and encodings as provided in your instructions.
