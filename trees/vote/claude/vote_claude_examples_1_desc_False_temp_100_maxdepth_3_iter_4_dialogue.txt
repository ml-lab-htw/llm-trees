Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier that predicts party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing the binary decisions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (using the voting encoding where 2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5    # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending is "no" (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze is "yes" (2)
        if nodes[2]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras is "no" (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses the actual feature encodings (2 = yes, 1 = no)
3. Sets thresholds at 1.5 to split between "yes" (2) and "no" (1) votes
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node decisions
5. Uses the exact feature names as provided in the keys
6. Follows typical voting patterns where:
   - Democrats tend to vote "no" on physician fee freeze, "yes" on education spending, and "no" on aid to nicaraguan contras
   - Republicans tend to have the opposite voting pattern

The decision tree maintains a maximum depth of
