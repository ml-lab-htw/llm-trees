Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # physician fee freeze: 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5
    # aid to nicaraguan contras: 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras is "no" (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze is "yes" (2)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of each decision node
3. Uses 1.5 as the threshold since the features are encoded as 1 (no) and 2 (yes)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node results

The decision logic is:
- If someone voted "no" on physician fee freeze (â‰¤1.5):
  - If they voted "no" on aid to nicaraguan contras: Democrat
  - If they voted "yes" on aid to nicaraguan contras: Republican
- If someone voted "yes" on physician fee freeze (>1.5):
  - Democrat
