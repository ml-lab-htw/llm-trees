Based on the provided feature encodings and target values, here's the decision tree classifier formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Converting conditions based on the feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # No on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1  # No on nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] <= 1  # No on education spending
    nodes[3] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1  # No on el salvador aid

    if nodes[0]:  # No on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # No on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Yes on nicaraguan contras
            if nodes[2]:  # No on education spending
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Yes on education spending
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[3]:  # No on el salvador aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Yes on el salvador aid
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the binary results of each node condition
3. Evaluates four key votes that are strong predictors of party affiliation
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and the list of node conditions

The decision boundaries are based on the feature encoding where:
- 2 = yes vote
- 1 = no vote

The conditions use "<= 1" to separate "no" votes (1) from "yes" votes (2), which helps identify voting patterns typical of each party. For example, Democrats were more likely to vote "no" on the physician fee freeze and Republicans were more likely to vote "yes" on El Salvador aid.
