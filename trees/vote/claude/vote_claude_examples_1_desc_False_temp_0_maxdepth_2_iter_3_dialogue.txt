Based on the provided feature encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a decision tree prediction function. I'll adjust my previous tree to use these specific encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1  # 1 = no
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if voted no on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if voted yes on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of each decision node
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node: Whether the vote on physician fee freeze was "no" (≤ 1)
   - Second node: Whether the vote on aid to nicaraguan contras was "no" (≤ 1)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition

The prediction logic follows:
- If voted "no" on physician fee freeze AND "no" on contra aid → Democrat (0)
- If voted "no" on physician fee freeze AND "yes" on contra aid → Republican (1)
- If voted "yes" on physician fee freeze → Republican (1)
