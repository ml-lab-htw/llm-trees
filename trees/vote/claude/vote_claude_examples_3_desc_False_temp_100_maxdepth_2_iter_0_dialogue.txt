Based on the decision tree I previously described and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Second node: Vote on aid to nicaraguan contras
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "physician fee freeze" is yes (encoded as 2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on "aid to nicaraguan contras" is yes (encoded as 2).

5. If the vote on physician fee freeze is yes, the prediction is Republican (1).

6. If the vote on physician fee freeze is no, we check the vote on aid to nicaraguan contras:
   - If it's yes, the prediction is Republican (1).
   - If it's no, the prediction is Democrat (0).

7. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using the most important features as determined in the previous step. It classifies party affiliation based on these key votes, following the encoding provided (1 = republican / 0 = democrat).
