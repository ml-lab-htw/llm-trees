Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes.

2. It creates a list `nodes` of length 2 to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "physician fee freeze" is yes (2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on "aid to nicaraguan contras" is yes (2).

5. Based on these conditions, it predicts the party affiliation:
   - If the vote on physician fee freeze is yes, it predicts Republican (1).
   - If the vote on physician fee freeze is no, it checks the vote on aid to nicaraguan contras:
     - If this vote is yes, it predicts Republican (1).
     - If this vote is no, it predicts Democrat (0).

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the decision tree structure I described earlier and uses the correct feature names and encodings as provided in your instructions.
