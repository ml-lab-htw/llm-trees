Based on the feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the most discriminative voting issues to predict party affiliation. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Converting conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # no on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2    # yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2       # yes on el salvador aid
    nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 1  # no on budget resolution
    nodes[4] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # no on nicaraguan contras aid

    if nodes[0]:  # no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # yes on education spending
            if nodes[2]:  # yes on el salvador aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[3]:  # no on budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # no on nicaraguan contras aid
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree classifier:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes representing the decision points
3. Makes decisions based on key voting patterns that typically distinguish between Democrats and Republicans
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The tree uses voting patterns on:
- Physician fee freeze (healthcare policy)
- Education spending
- El Salvador aid (foreign policy)
- Budget resolution (fiscal policy)
- Aid to Nicaraguan contras (foreign policy)

These issues were chosen as they typically show strong partisan division and are good predictors of party affiliation. The conditions are based on the
