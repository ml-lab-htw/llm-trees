Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the 'physician fee freeze' and 'education spending' features, adjusting for the fact that votes are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # physician fee freeze <= 1.5 means voting 'no' (1)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5
    # education spending <= 1.5 means voting 'no' (1)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. Evaluates whether the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (1) using threshold 1.5
4. If needed, evaluates whether the vote on education spending is 'no' (1) using threshold 1.5
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each decision node

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because:
- Values of 1 represent 'no' votes
- Values of 2 represent 'yes' votes
- 1.5 is the midpoint that separates these two values
