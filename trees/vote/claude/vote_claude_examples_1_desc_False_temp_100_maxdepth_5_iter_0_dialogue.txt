Based on the given features and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that classifies party affiliation using the key votes, with 1 indicating Republican and 0 indicating Democrat:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions using the correct feature names and thresholds
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no for votes
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] > 1.5  # voting yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5   # voting no on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["water project cost sharing"] <= 1.5  # voting no on water project
    nodes[3] = X["el salvador aid"] > 1.5  # voting yes on el salvador aid
    nodes[4] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] > 1.5  # voting yes on contra aid

    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending = no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending = yes
            if nodes[4]:  # nicaraguan contras = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # nicaraguan contras = no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[2]:  # water project = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # water project = yes
            if nodes[3]:  # el salvador aid = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # el salvador aid = no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the physician fee freeze vote
2. Then branches based on education spending or water project cost sharing
3. Makes final decisions based on foreign policy votes (El Salvador aid and Nicaraguan contras)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because the votes are encoded as 2 (
