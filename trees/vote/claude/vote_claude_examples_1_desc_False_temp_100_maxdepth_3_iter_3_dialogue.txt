Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) using the three most discriminating votes from my earlier tree, adapting to the actual feature encoding where 2 = yes and 1 = no.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] > 1.5  # checking for "yes" vote
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] > 1.5    # checking for "yes" vote
    nodes[2] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] > 1.5  # checking for "yes" vote
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # if "no" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if "yes" on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if "no" on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if "yes" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # if "yes" on aid to nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # if "no" on aid to nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 boolean values representing the conditions at each node
3. Uses the following decision rules:
   - First checks the vote on physician fee freeze
   - For those voting "no" on fee freeze, checks education spending
   - For those voting "yes" on fee freeze, checks aid to nicaraguan contras
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because the features are encoded as 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no", so 1.5 is the natural splitting point between these values.
