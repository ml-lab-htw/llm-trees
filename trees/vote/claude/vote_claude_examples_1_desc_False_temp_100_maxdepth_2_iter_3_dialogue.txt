Based on the provided feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat), here's the decision tree function that implements the previously described logic:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Check if voted no on physician fee freeze (1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1
    
    # Check if voted no on education spending (1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # republican
        else:  # voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates if the representative voted no (≤ 1) on physician fee freeze
4. For those who voted no on physician fee freeze, evaluates if they voted no (≤ 1) on education spending
5. Returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node decisions

The thresholds are set to 1 because in the encoding scheme, 1 = no vote and 2 = yes vote, so checking if a value is ≤ 1 is equivalent to checking for a "no" vote.
