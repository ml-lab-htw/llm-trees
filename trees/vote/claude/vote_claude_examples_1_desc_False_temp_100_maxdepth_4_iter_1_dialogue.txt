Based on the provided feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat), here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Converting the conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5    # Check if voted no
    nodes[1] = X["water project cost sharing"] <= 1.5    # Check if voted no
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5    # Check if voted no
    nodes[3] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1.5    # Check if voted no

    if nodes[0]:  # If voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted no on water project
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If voted yes on water project
            if nodes[3]:  # If voted no on Nicaraguan contras
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # If voted yes on Nicaraguan contras
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # If voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If voted yes on education spending
            if nodes[3]:  # If voted no on Nicaraguan contras
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # If voted yes on Nicaraguan contras
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the feature encoding where 2 = yes and 1 = no, so the threshold of 1.5 distinguishes between yes and no votes
2. Returns predicted party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)
3. Returns a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the tree
4. Uses the exact feature names as provided
5. Follows the same tree structure as previously described
6. Has a maximum depth of 4
