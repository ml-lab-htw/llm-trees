Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the 'physician fee freeze' and 'education spending' features, adjusting for the fact that votes are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Check if physician fee freeze vote is no (1)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1
    # Check if education spending vote is no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of each decision
3. First checks if the representative voted 'no' (1) on physician fee freeze
4. Then checks if they voted 'no' (1) on education spending
5. Makes predictions based on these votes:
   - No on both → Republican (1)
   - No on fee freeze, Yes on education → Democrat (0)
   - Yes on fee freeze → Democrat (0)
6. Returns both the prediction and the list of node results

The thresholds are set to 1 because:
- Votes are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no)
- "≤ 1" means we're checking for "no" votes
- "> 1" would mean we're checking for "yes" votes
