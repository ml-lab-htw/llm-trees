Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the three key voting features I identified earlier. I'll adjust the thresholds based on the actual encoding (1 = no, 2 = yes):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes based on vote thresholds
    # Note: 1 = no, 2 = yes
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[1]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[2]:  # education spending = no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending = yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates three binary decision nodes based on key voting patterns
3. Returns both:
   - The predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)
   - A list of three boolean values representing the decision nodes

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because the features are encoded as:
- 1 = no vote
- 2 = yes vote
So 1.5 is the natural splitting point between yes and no votes.

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats typically voted no on physician fee freeze
- Democrats typically voted no on aid to nicaraguan contras
- Democrats typically voted yes on education spending

And Republicans typically voted the opposite way on these issues.
