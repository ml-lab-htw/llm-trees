Based on the provided feature names and their encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a decision tree function that follows the structure I previously suggested and matches the required format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [
        X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1,
        X["education spending"] > 1
    ]

    prediction = (
        0 if (nodes[0] and nodes[1]) or not nodes[0]
        else 1
    )

    return prediction, nodes

```

This decision tree classifies a member of congress as either Republican (1) or Democrat (0) based on their voting record. The function:
1. Takes a dictionary of voting records as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of each node condition
3. Evaluates three key votes:
   - physician fee freeze
   - aid to nicaraguan contras
   - education spending
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions

The structure reflects typical voting patterns where Democrats were more likely to:
- Vote no on physician fee freeze
- Vote no on aid to nicaraguan contras
- Vote yes on education spending

While Republicans were more likely to vote the opposite way on these issues.
