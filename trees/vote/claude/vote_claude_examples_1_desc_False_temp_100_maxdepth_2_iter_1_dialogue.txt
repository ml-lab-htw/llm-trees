Based on the provided feature names and encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), here's the prediction function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [
        X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1,  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        X["education spending"] > 1      # Voted yes on education spending
    ]

    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    elif nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions using the correct encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node truth values

The logic follows our earlier decision tree structure, but now properly encoded according to the specified format where:
- 2 means "yes" vote
- 1 means "no" vote
- Target 1 means Republican
- Target 0 means Democrat
