Based on the provided feature names and their encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Converting conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # no on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2    # yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2  # yes on budget resolution
    nodes[3] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 1  # no on contra aid
    
    if nodes[0]:  # no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # yes on budget resolution
            if nodes[3]:  # no on contra aid
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of votes as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of each condition
3. Evaluates four key votes that tend to distinguish between parties
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats tend to vote no on physician fee freeze, yes on education spending, yes on budget resolution, and no on contra aid
- Republicans tend to vote the opposite way on these issues

The conditions use the actual encoding provided (2 = yes, 1 = no) and the exact feature names from the list.
