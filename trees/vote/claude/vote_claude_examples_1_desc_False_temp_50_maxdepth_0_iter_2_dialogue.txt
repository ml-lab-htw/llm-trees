Based on the provided information and requirements, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X['education spending'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X['mx missile'] == 2  # yes vote

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each condition in the decision tree:
   - `aid to nicaraguan contras`: yes vote (2) indicates Republican
   - `physician fee freeze`: yes vote (2) indicates Republican
   - `education spending`: yes vote (2) indicates Democrat
   - `mx missile`: yes vote (2) indicates Republican

4. It follows the decision tree logic to make a prediction:
   - 1 represents Republican
   - 0 represents Democrat

5. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation adheres to the provided feature keys, target variable encoding, and feature descriptions. It uses the most important features from the decision tree we discussed earlier to classify party affiliation.
