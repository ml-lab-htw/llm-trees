I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree I described earlier, taking into account the feature encoding (2 = yes / 1 = no) and target encoding (1 = republican / 0 = democrat).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second split: education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # republican
        else:  # voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Uses thresholds of 1.5 to split between 'yes' (2) and 'no' (1) votes
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The logic follows that:
- If someone votes no on physician fee freeze (≤1.5) and no on education spending (≤1.5), they're predicted as Republican (1)
- If someone votes no on physician fee freeze (≤1.5) but yes on education spending (>1.5), they're predicted as Democrat (0)
- If someone votes yes on physician fee freeze (>1.5), they're predicted as Democrat (0) regardless of their education spending vote
