Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) using the three most discriminative features we identified earlier. I'll adjust the thresholds according to the actual encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store the results of each condition
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (2 = yes, 1 = no for all votes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1.5  # First split on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1.5    # Second split on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1.5       # Third split on el salvador aid
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If NO on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If NO on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If YES on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If YES on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # If NO on el salvador aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If YES on el salvador aid
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three decision nodes
3. Evaluates each condition using the actual encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Uses the threshold of 1.5 to split between yes (2) and no (1) votes
5. Returns both the prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node results

The tree follows the same structure as before, but now properly handles the actual feature encoding where:
- 2 represents "yes" votes
- 1 represents "no" votes
- The threshold of 1.5 effectively separates yes from no votes

The prediction logic matches our earlier tree structure while properly accounting for the encoding of
