Based on the provided features and their encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation and returns the node truth values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1  # No on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1  # No on nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] <= 1  # No on education spending
    nodes[3] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] <= 1  # No on budget resolution
    nodes[4] = X["el salvador aid"] <= 1  # No on el salvador aid

    if nodes[0]:  # No on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # No on nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Yes on nicaraguan contras
            if nodes[2]:  # No on education spending
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Yes on education spending
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[3]:  # No on budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Yes on budget resolution
            if nodes[4]:  # No on el salvador aid
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Yes on el salvador aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the 5 inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition using the given encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node truth values

The decision tree uses the following key votes:
1. Physician fee freeze
2. Aid to Nicaraguan contras
3. Education spending
4. Adoption of budget resolution
5. El Salvador aid
