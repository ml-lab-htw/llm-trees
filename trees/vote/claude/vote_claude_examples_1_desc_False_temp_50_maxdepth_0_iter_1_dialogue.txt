Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[4] = X["superfund right to sue"] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It initializes a list `nodes` with 5 elements, corresponding to the 5 decision nodes in our tree.

3. Each node condition checks if the vote on a particular issue is "yes" (2).

4. The function then follows the decision tree structure we defined earlier, assigning a prediction of 1 for Republican and 0 for Democrat.

5. Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation assumes that:
- A "yes" vote is represented by 2 and a "no" vote by 1, as per the feature description.
- The target variable encoding is 1 for Republican and 0 for Democrat.

The decision tree structure matches the one we previously defined, using the most important features to classify party affiliation based on voting patterns.
