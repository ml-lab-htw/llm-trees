Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I proposed earlier, here's a Python function that predicts party affiliation and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X['aid to nicaraguan contras'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X['physician fee freeze'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X['education spending'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X['mx missile'] == 2  # yes vote

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each condition in the decision tree and stores the result (True or False) in the `nodes` list.

4. It then follows the decision tree logic to make a prediction:
   - If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is yes, it predicts Republican.
   - Otherwise, it checks the vote on physician fee freeze. If yes, it predicts Republican.
   - If no to both, it checks the vote on education spending. If yes, it predicts Democrat.
   - If no to education spending, it checks the vote on MX missile. If yes, it predicts Republican; if no, it predicts Democrat.

5. Finally, it returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the provided feature encodings (2 for yes, 1 for
