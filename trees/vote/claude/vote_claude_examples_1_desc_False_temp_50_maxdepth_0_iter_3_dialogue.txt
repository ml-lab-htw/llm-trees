Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X["mx missile"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[4] = X["superfund right to sue"] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each condition in the decision tree, storing the result (True or False) in the `nodes` list.

4. It then follows the decision tree structure to make a prediction:
   - 1 represents Republican
   - 0 represents Democrat

5. Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the decision tree structure I provided earlier, using the exact feature keys you specified and the correct encoding for votes (2 = yes, 1 = no) and party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
