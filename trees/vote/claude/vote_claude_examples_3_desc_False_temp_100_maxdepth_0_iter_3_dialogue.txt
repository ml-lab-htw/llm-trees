```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list to store node truth values

    # Hypothetical important features and thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # Vote YES on aid to contras
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2        # Vote YES on education spending

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican (likely to vote yes on contras)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat (likely to vote no on contras, yes on education)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican (likely to vote no on both)

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that "2" represents a "yes" vote and "1" represents a "no" vote. The code directly uses these values in the comparisons.

2. **Thresholds:**  Since we don't have real data, I've used a simplified hypothetical tree based on "aid to Nicaraguan contras" and "education spending."  The assumption is that a "yes" vote on contras is a strong indicator of being Republican.  A "no" vote on contras combined with a "yes" vote on education spending is hypothesized to lean Democrat.

3. **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the boolean values (True/False, represented as 1/0 when returned) for each decision node.

4. **Simplified Structure:** This is a highly simplified tree. A real-world tree would likely be more complex, involving more features and potentially different thresholds.

5. **Using a Machine Learning Library:**  For real-world applications, you should *always* use a machine learning library like scikit-learn.  This code demonstrates the basic logic, but scikit-learn provides robust algorithms, handles missing values, and allows for model evaluation and tuning.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    "handicapped infants": 2,
    "water project cost sharing": 1,
    "adoption of the budget resolution": 2,
    # ... other votes ...
    "aid to nicaraguan contras": 2,
    "education spending": 1,
    # ... rest of the votes ...
    "export administration act south africa": 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction} (1=Republican, 0=Democrat)")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") 
```



This example shows how to use the `predict` function. Remember that without real data and training, this example tree is just for illustrative purposes.  Provide a dataset, and I can help you build a real decision tree model.
