Based on the provided feature names and encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions using the 2=yes/1=no encoding
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 1  # checking if 'no'
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] == 2    # checking if 'yes'
    nodes[2] = X["adoption of the budget resolution"] == 2  # checking if 'yes'
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending is 'yes'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # education spending is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze is 'yes'
        if nodes[2]:  # budget resolution is 'yes'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # budget resolution is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses three key votes:
1. physician fee freeze
2. education spending
3. adoption of the budget resolution

The function returns both:
- The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
- A list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition in the internal nodes

The logic follows typical party-line voting patterns where:
- Democrats tend to vote 'no' on physician fee freeze, 'yes' on education spending
- Republicans tend to vote 'yes' on physician fee freeze, 'no' on education spending
- The budget resolution vote helps further refine the classification
