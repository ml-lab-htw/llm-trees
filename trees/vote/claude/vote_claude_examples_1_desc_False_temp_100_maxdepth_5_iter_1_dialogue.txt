Based on the provided feature encoding where 2 = yes and 1 = no for votes, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for 4 inner nodes
    
    # Convert conditions to boolean using the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # yes vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # yes vote on contra aid
    nodes[2] = X["education spending"] == 2  # yes vote on education spending
    nodes[3] = X["el salvador aid"] == 2  # yes vote on El Salvador aid

    if not nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if not nodes[1]:  # contra aid = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # contra aid = yes
            if not nodes[2]:  # education spending = no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending = yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if not nodes[3]:  # el salvador aid = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # el salvador aid = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes for the tree's internal decision points
3. Evaluates each condition based on the vote encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree uses these key votes:
- Physician fee freeze
- Aid to Nicaraguan contras
- Education spending
- El Salvador aid

Each node condition returns True if the vote is "yes" (2) and False if the vote is "no" (1), following the provided encoding scheme.
