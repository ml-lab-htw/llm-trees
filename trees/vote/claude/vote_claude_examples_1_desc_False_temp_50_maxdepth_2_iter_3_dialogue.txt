Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican / 0 = democrat) using the 'physician fee freeze' and 'aid to nicaraguan contras' features. Since the votes are encoded as 2 = yes and 1 = no, I'll adjust the thresholds accordingly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on physician fee freeze (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1
    
    # Second split on aid to nicaraguan contras (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras is 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras is 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze is 'yes'
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. First checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (≤ 1)
2. If it is 'no', then checks if the vote on aid to nicaraguan contras is 'no' (≤ 1)
3. Predicts:
   - Democrat (0) if both votes are 'no'
   - Republican (1) if physician fee freeze is 'no' but aid to nicaraguan contras is 'yes'
   - Republican (1) if physician fee freeze is 'yes'
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions (True/False values)
