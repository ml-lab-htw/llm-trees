Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses 'physician fee freeze' and 'education spending' as the key features. Since the votes are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no), I'll adjust the thresholds accordingly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Check if physician fee freeze vote is no (1)
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] <= 1
    # Check if education spending vote is no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["education spending"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if the representative voted 'no' on physician fee freeze (≤ 1)
4. Then checks if the representative voted 'no' on education spending (≤ 1)
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The decision logic follows:
- If voted no on physician fee freeze and no on education spending → Republican (1)
- If voted no on physician fee freeze and yes on education spending → Democrat (0)
- If voted yes on physician fee freeze → Democrat (0)
