Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician fee freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid to nicaraguan contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` with 2 elements, corresponding to the two inner nodes of our decision tree.

2. The first node checks if the politician voted "yes" on the physician fee freeze (encoded as 2 in the dataset).

3. The second node checks if the politician voted "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras (also encoded as 2).

4. If the politician voted "yes" on the physician fee freeze, they are classified as Republican (1).

5. If they voted "no" on the physician fee freeze but "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras, they are classified as Republican (1).

6. If they voted "no" on both issues, they are classified as Democrat (0).

7. The function returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings provided in the dataset description.
