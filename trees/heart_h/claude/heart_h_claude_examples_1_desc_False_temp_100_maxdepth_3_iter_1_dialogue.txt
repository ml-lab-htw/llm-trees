Based on the provided feature keys and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I described earlier, adjusting the thresholds to match realistic values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for 3 inner nodes
    
    # First level: Check ST depression (oldpeak)
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second level: Check number of vessels
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    # Third level: Check chest pain type
    nodes[2] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Asymptomatic
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if X["thalach"] <= 150:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three inner nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - oldpeak (ST depression) <= 1.5
   - ca (number of vessels) <= 0
   - chest_pain == 0 (Asymptomatic)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease) and the list of node truth values

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on medical literature and typical values for these measurements.
