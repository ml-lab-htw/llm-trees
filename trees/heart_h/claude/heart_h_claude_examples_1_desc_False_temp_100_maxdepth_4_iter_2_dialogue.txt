Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the same structure as before but with the correct feature names and sensible thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for 4 inner nodes
    
    # First level: ST depression
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        # Second level: Maximum Heart Rate
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
        
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach <= 150
            # Third level: Chest Pain Type
            nodes[2] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Heart Disease Absent
        else:  # thalach > 150
            # Third level: Number of vessels
            nodes[3] = X["ca"] <= 0
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Heart Disease Absent
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        # Second level: Chest Pain Type
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # 3 = Typical angina
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Heart Disease Absent
        else:
            # Third level: Number of vessels
            nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses the correct feature names as provided
3. Uses appropriate thresholds based on the feature descriptions
4. Returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
5. Follows the same logic as the previously shown tree structure
6. Uses the correct encoding for the target variable (1 = yes, 0 =
