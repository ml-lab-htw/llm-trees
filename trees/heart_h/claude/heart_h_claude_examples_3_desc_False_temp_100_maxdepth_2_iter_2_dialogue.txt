Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the specific feature keys and target encoding you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Heart Disease Absent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, using the following features:

1. "oldpeak": ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
2. "thalach": Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction: 1 for Heart Disease Present, 0 for Heart Disease Absent
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Note that this decision tree uses only two features out of the many available. In a real-world scenario, a more complex model using additional features would likely be more accurate. However, this simplified model focuses on two important indicators of heart disease risk.
