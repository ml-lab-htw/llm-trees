Based on the provided information and the decision tree I created earlier, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. I'll use meaningful threshold values based on the feature descriptions.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second level nodes
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The root node checks if `oldpeak` (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is <= 1.5.

4. The second level nodes check:
   - If `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is <= 150
   - If `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is <= 1

5. Based on these conditions, we determine the prediction:
   - 1 represents "yes" (patient has heart disease)
   - 0 represents "no" (patient does not have heart disease)

6. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we created earlier, using the correct feature names from the provided list and appropriate threshold values based on the feature descriptions.
