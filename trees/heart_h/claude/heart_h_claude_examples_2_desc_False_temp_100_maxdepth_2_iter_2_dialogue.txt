Based on the provided information and the decision tree I created earlier, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X['thalach'] <= 150
    nodes[2] = X['ca'] <= 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if 'oldpeak' (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is <= 1.5.

4. The second node checks if 'thalach' (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is <= 150 bpm.

5. The third node checks if 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is <= 1.

6. The function then uses these conditions to determine the prediction:
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach <= 150, predict Heart Disease Present (1)
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach > 150, predict No Heart Disease (0)
   - If oldpeak > 1.5, predict Heart Disease Present (1) regardless of 'ca' value

7. The function returns the prediction (1 for Heart Disease Present, 0 for No Heart Disease) and the list of node truth values.

Note: This decision tree is a simplified model and may not capture all the complexities of heart disease prediction. In a real-world scenario, a more comprehensive model would likely be necessary for accurate predictions.
