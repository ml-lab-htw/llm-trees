Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree that uses 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) as the splitting feature with a threshold of 1.5:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the decision condition
3. Checks if 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) is <= 1.5
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision condition

The threshold of 1.5 is a clinically relevant value for ST depression, where values above 1.5 mm are generally considered more indicative of heart disease.
