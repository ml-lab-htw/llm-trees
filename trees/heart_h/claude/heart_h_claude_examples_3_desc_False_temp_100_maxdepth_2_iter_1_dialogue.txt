Based on the decision tree I previously described and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (for a depth-2 tree) to store the boolean results of each node's condition.

3. The root node (nodes[0]) checks if "oldpeak" (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is <= 1.5.

4. The second node (nodes[1]) checks if "thalach" (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is <= 150 bpm.

5. The prediction logic follows the structure of the decision tree:
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach <= 150, predict Heart Disease Present (1)
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach > 150, predict No Heart Disease (0)
   - If oldpeak > 1.5, predict Heart Disease Present (1)

6. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (1 for Heart Disease Present, 0 for No Heart Disease) and the list of node condition results.

This implementation uses the feature keys as provided and follows the encoding for the target variable (1 = yes, 0 = no for heart disease). The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 150 for thalach) are based on general medical knowledge and could be adjusted based on specific dataset characteristics if needed.
