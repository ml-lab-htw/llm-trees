Based on the provided feature keys and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression Induced by Exercise) as the splitting criterion, with a threshold of 1.5:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # only one node since depth is 1
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # no heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the conditions
3. Evaluates if oldpeak <= 1.5 and stores the result in nodes[0]
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (no heart disease) if oldpeak <= 1.5, 1 (heart disease) otherwise
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition oldpeak <= 1.5

The threshold of 1.5 is a clinically relevant value for ST depression, where values above 1.5 mm are generally considered more indicative of heart disease.
