Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that predicts whether a patient has heart disease and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as we have 2 inner nodes in our depth-2 tree), initially set to `None`.

3. The first condition checks if "oldpeak" (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is <= 1.5.

4. The second condition checks if "thalach" (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is <= 150 bpm.

5. Based on these conditions, we make the prediction:
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach <= 150, predict Heart Disease (1)
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach > 150, predict No Heart Disease (0)
   - If oldpeak > 1.5, predict Heart Disease (1)

6. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the provided feature keys and target variable encoding (1 for yes, 0 for no). The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 150 for thalach) are based on typical clinical values and the original decision tree I proposed.
