Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions using the exact feature names and appropriate thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[3] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[4] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2  # yes
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach <= 150
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 55
                prediction = 0
            else:  # age > 55
                if nodes[3]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:  # thalach > 150
            if nodes[4]:  # ca <= 0
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[5]:  # exang == yes
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Uses appropriate thresholds based on the feature descriptions and typical medical values
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no heart disease, 1 = yes heart disease) and the list of node conditions
4. Uses the correct encodings for categorical variables (e.g., chest_pain, exang)
5. Maintains a maximum depth of 5
6. Uses clinically relevant decision points

The tree primarily focuses on:
- ST Depression (oldpeak)
- Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)
- Age
- Chest Pain Type
- Number of
