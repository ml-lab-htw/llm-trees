Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and descriptions, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if "ST Depression Induced by Exercise" (oldpeak) is <= 1.5.

4. The second node checks if "Maximum Heart Rate Achieved" (thalach) is <= 150.

5. The third node checks if "Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy" (ca) is <= 1.

6. The prediction is made based on these conditions:
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach <= 150, predict Heart Disease (1)
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach > 150, predict No Heart Disease (0)
   - If oldpeak > 1.5, predict Heart Disease (1) regardless of ca value

7. The function returns the prediction (1 for Heart Disease, 0 for No Heart Disease) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, using the correct feature keys and maintaining a maximum depth of 2. The thresholds used (1.5 for oldpeak, 150 for thalach, and 1 for ca) are based on typical values for these features in heart disease diagnosis.
