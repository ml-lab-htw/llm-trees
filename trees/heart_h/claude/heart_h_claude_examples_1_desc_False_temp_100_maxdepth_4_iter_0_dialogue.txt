Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check ST depression
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second level: Check number of vessels
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    # Third level: Age check for left branch, Heart rate for right branch
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
    
    # Fourth level: Maximum heart rate check
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 55
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[3]:  # thalach <= 150
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # thalach > 150
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of node conditions
3. Evaluates four key features with clinically relevant thresholds:
   - ST depression (oldpeak) at 1.5
   - Number of vessels (ca) at 0
   - Age at 55 years
   - Maximum heart rate (thalach) at 150 bpm
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node conditions
