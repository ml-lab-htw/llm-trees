Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the key features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ST Depression <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of Vessels <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # ST Depression > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates whether ST depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5 (first node)
4. Evaluates whether the number of colored vessels (ca) is 0 (second node)
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node truth values

The thresholds are chosen based on medical knowledge:
- oldpeak > 1.5 mm is generally considered significant ST depression
- Any colored vessels (ca > 0) indicate some level of coronary artery disease
