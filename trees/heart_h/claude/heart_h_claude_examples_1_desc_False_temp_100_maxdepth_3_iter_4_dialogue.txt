Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the same structure as before but with the correct feature names and sensible thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55

    if nodes[0]:  # ST Depression <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of vessels <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Age <= 55
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates three conditions:
   - ST depression (oldpeak) threshold at 1.5
   - Number of colored vessels (ca) threshold at 0
   - Age threshold at 55 years
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of boolean values for the decision nodes

The thresholds chosen are clinically relevant:
- oldpeak > 1.5 mm is considered significant ST depression
- Any colored vessels (ca > 0) indicate potential coronary artery disease
- Age 55 is a common risk threshold for cardiovascular disease
