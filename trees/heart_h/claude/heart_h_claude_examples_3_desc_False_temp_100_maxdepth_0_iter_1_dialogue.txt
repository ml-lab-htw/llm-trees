Based on the provided information and examples, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for heart disease prediction. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X["age"] <= 60
    nodes[6] = X["exang"] == 2  # 2 = yes

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if X["chol"] <= 240:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree based on the most important features for heart disease prediction. It uses the exact keys provided for the features and follows the target variable encoding (1 for yes, 0 for no).

The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values for a patient. It returns a tuple containing the prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features:
