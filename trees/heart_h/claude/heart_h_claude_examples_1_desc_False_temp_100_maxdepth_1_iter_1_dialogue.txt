Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression Induced by Exercise) as the key feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing patient features
2. Creates a list for storing the single node's condition result
3. Evaluates if oldpeak (ST Depression) is <= 1.5 (clinically relevant threshold)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (heart disease)
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition

The threshold of 1.5 for oldpeak is based on clinical significance, as ST depression > 1.5mm during exercise is generally considered a significant indicator of coronary artery disease.
