Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Left child
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        # Right child
        nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The root node checks if "ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest" (oldpeak) is <= 1.5.

4. If oldpeak <= 1.5:
   - We then check if "Maximum Heart Rate Achieved" (thalach) is <= 150 bpm.
   - If thalach <= 150, we predict Heart Disease (1).
   - If thalach > 150, we predict No Heart Disease (0).

5. If oldpeak > 1.5:
   - We check if "Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy" (ca) is <= 1.
   - Regardless of the result, we predict Heart Disease (1) in both cases.

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Heart Disease, 0 for No Heart Disease) and the list of node conditions.

Note: In this tree, all paths except one lead to a Heart Disease prediction. This is based on the structure of the decision tree we created earlier. In a real-world scenario, you might want to
