Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific requirements you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as we have 2 inner nodes in our depth-2 tree), initially set to `None`.

3. The first condition checks if "oldpeak" (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is <= 1.5.

4. The second condition checks if "ca" (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is <= 0.5. This effectively splits between 0 vessels and 1 or more vessels.

5. The prediction logic follows the structure of our decision tree:
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and ca <= 0.5, predict No Heart Disease (0)
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and ca > 0.5, predict Heart Disease (1)
   - If oldpeak > 1.5, predict Heart Disease (1) regardless of other factors

6. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for No Heart Disease, 1 for Heart Disease) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation uses the exact keys provided in the feature list and follows the target variable encoding where 1 indicates the presence of heart disease and 0 indicates no heart disease.
