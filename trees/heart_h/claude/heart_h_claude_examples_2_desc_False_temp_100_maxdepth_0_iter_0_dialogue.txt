Based on the provided information and requirements, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree for heart disease classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X['ca'] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X['thalach'] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X['age'] <= 55
    nodes[4] = X['chest_pain'] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X['exang'] == 2  # yes
    nodes[6] = X['age'] <= 60

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[6]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for No Heart Disease, 1 for Heart Disease)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree is based on the most important features identified earlier, with some adjustments to match the provided feature names and encodings:

1. `oldpeak` (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest)
2. `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
3. `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
4. `age`
5. `chest_pain` (Chest Pain Type)
6. `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina)
