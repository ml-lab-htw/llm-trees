Based on the provided information and the decision tree I created earlier, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X['ca'] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X['thalach'] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X['chest_pain'] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    nodes[4] = X['age'] <= 55
    nodes[5] = X['exang'] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[6] = X['thal'] == 2  # 2 = Normal

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function uses the following features from the provided list:
- 'oldpeak': ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
- 'ca': Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
- 'thalach': Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- 'chest_pain': Chest Pain Type
- 'age': Age
- 'exang': Exercise Induced Angina
- 'thal': Thalassemia

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (1 for Heart Disease, 0 for No Heart Disease)
