This function implements the decision tree I proposed earlier, but now using the exact feature names and encodings you provided. The tree uses:

- oldpeak (ST Depression): threshold at 1.5
- thalach (Max Heart Rate): threshold at 150 bpm
- age: threshold at 60 years
- ca (Number of Vessels): threshold at 1
- chest_pain: checking for asymptomatic (0)
- exang: checking for no exercise induced angina (1)

The function returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and a list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the internal nodes was met.

Each threshold was chosen based on medical knowledge and typical clinical values:
- ST depression > 1.5mm is often considered clinically significant
- Max heart rate of 150
