Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X["age"] <= 65
    nodes[6] = X["exang"] == 2  # Yes

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if X["chol"] <= 250:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features as input. It then evaluates the conditions at each node of the decision tree and returns two things:

1. The prediction: 1 for Heart Disease, 0 for No Heart Disease
2. A list of boolean values representing whether each condition in the inner nodes was satisfied (1) or not (0)

The function uses the exact keys provided for the features and adheres to the given encodings. For example:
- `oldpeak` is used for ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
- `ca` is used for Number of Major Vessels Colored by
