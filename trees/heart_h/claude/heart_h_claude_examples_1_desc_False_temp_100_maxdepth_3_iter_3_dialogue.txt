Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check ST depression (oldpeak)
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check number of vessels
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
        nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
        
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        # Node 2: Check chest pain type
        nodes[2] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
        
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three internal nodes
3. Makes decisions based on:
   - ST depression (oldpeak) with threshold 1.5
   - Number of vessels (ca) with threshold 0
   - Age with threshold 55 years
   - Chest pain type (specifically checking for asymptomatic = 0)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the truth values of the internal node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on typical medical values and the provided feature descriptions.
