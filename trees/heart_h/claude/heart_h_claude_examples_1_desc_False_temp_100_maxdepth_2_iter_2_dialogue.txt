Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the key features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5  # ST depression threshold
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0         # Number of major vessels threshold
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ST depression is low
        if nodes[1]:  # No major vessels affected
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # One or more vessels affected
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # ST depression is high
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing feature values
2. Creates a list to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates if ST depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5 (first decision node)
4. Evaluates if number of vessels (ca) is 0 (second decision node)
5. Makes a prediction (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)
6. Returns both the prediction and the list of node results

The thresholds chosen (1.5 for oldpeak and 0 for ca) are clinically relevant values:
- oldpeak > 1.5 mm is generally considered significant ST depression
- Any affected major vessels (ca > 0) indicates potential coronary artery disease
