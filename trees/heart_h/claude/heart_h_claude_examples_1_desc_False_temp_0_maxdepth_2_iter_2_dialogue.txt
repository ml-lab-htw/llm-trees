Based on the provided feature descriptions and format, I'll create a prediction function for the heart disease decision tree using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the key features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ST Depression <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of Major Vessels <= 0.5
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels > 0.5
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # ST Depression > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the patient's features
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. First checks if ST Depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. For patients with lower ST Depression, checks if the number of major vessels (ca) is <= 0.5
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 0.5 for ca) are chosen based on medical literature and typical diagnostic criteria:
- ST Depression > 1.5mm is often considered clinically significant
- Having 1 or more affected vessels (ca > 0.5) is indicative of coronary artery disease
