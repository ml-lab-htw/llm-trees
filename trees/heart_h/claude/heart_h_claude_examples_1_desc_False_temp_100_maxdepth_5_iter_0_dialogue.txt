Based on the feature descriptions and encodings provided, here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions using the exact feature names and proper value ranges
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 55
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:  # age > 55
                if nodes[3]:  # thalach <= 140
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:  # thalach > 140
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            if nodes[4]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:  # chest_pain is not Asymptomatic
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Uses appropriate thresholds based on the feature ranges
3. Uses the correct encoding for the target variable (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for each node condition
5. Has a maximum depth of 5
6. Uses the most important clinical indicators for heart disease

The decision tree particularly focuses on:
- ST depression (oldpeak)
- Number of major vessels (ca)
- Age
- Maximum heart rate (thalach)
- Chest pain type

These features are commonly used in heart disease prediction and the thresh
