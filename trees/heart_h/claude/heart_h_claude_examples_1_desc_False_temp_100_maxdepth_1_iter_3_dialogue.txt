Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree function using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) as the key predictor:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one decision node for depth-1 tree
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5  # ST Depression threshold at 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list for storing the node conditions (only one node for depth-1)
3. Checks if ST Depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The threshold of 1.5 for oldpeak is chosen because:
- The feature ranges from 0 to 5
- Values above 1.5 typically indicate significant ST depression
- This is a clinically relevant threshold for ST depression
