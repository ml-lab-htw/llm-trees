Based on the heart disease features and their encodings, I'll create a prediction function using the decision tree I proposed earlier, which uses 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the main features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: ST Depression (oldpeak) <= 1.5
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second decision node: Number of Major Vessels (ca) <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If ca <= 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:  # If ca > 0
            prediction = 0  # Heart Disease Absent
    else:  # If oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates whether ST Depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. For cases where oldpeak <= 1.5, it then checks if the number of major vessels (ca) is <= 0
5. Makes a prediction (1 for heart disease present, 0 for heart disease absent)
6. Returns both the prediction and the list of node results

The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 0 for ca) are meaningful values based on medical knowledge:
- ST Depression > 1.5 mm is generally considered significant in stress testing
- Having 0 blocked major vessels vs having 1 or more is a natural splitting point for cardiovascular health
