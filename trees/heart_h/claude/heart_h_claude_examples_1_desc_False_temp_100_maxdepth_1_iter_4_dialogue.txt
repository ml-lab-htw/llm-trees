Based on the provided feature descriptions and the desired format, I'll create a decision function for the decision tree using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) as the critical feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Uses the 'oldpeak' feature (ST Depression) with a threshold of 1.5
3. Returns a tuple containing:
   - The prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease)
   - A list of node conditions (True/False values)
4. Uses only the exact feature names provided
5. Implements the simple decision tree with max_depth=1

The threshold of 1.5 for ST depression is a clinically relevant value for detecting significant cardiac ischemia.
