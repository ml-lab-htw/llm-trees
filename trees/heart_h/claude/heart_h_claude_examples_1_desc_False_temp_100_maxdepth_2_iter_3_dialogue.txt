Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll modify the decision tree function to use 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the main features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if ST depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. If true, then checks if number of major vessels (ca) is 0
5. Makes prediction based on these conditions
6. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node results

The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 0 for ca) are chosen based on medical literature and the typical ranges for these values in heart disease diagnosis.
