Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts heart disease and returns both the prediction and the node conditions. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 150
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[3] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2  # yes
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach > 150
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 55
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:  # thalach <= 150
            if nodes[3]:  # ca <= 0
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[4]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[5]:  # exang is yes
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Follows the correct encoding for features and target variable
3. Implements the decision tree structure we discussed earlier
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are based on medical knowledge and typical values:
- ST depression (oldpeak) threshold of 1.5 mm is clinically significant
- Maximum heart
