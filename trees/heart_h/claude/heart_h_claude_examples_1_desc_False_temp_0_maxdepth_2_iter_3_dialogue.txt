Based on the decision tree I proposed and the feature specifications you provided, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. First checks if ST depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. If true, then checks if number of major vessels (ca) is 0
5. Returns:
   - The prediction (1 for Heart Disease, 0 for No Heart Disease)
   - The list of boolean values for each decision node

The thresholds used are:
- oldpeak: 1.5 (common clinical threshold for significant ST depression)
- ca: 0 (presence vs. absence of blocked vessels)

This implementation uses the exact feature names from your specification ('oldpeak' and 'ca') and follows the target encoding (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease).
