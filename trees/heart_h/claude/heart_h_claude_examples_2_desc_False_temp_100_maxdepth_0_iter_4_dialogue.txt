Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you provided, here's the Python function that predicts heart disease and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X['thalach'] <= 150
    nodes[2] = X['age'] <= 55
    nodes[3] = X['ca'] <= 1
    nodes[4] = X['chest_pain'] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X['exang'] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[6] = X['chol'] <= 240

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if X['age'] <= 60:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the prediction (0 for No Heart Disease, 1 for Heart Disease), and the second element is a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features:
1. ST Depression (oldpeak)
2. Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)
3. Age
4. Number of Major Vessels Colored (ca)
5. Chest Pain Type (chest_pain)
6. Exercise
