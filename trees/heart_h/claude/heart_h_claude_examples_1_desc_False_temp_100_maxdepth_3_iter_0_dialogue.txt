Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll convert the previously discussed decision tree into a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for 3 inner nodes
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["chest_pain"] in [3, 2]  # Typical angina or Non-anginal pain
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # chest_pain is Typical angina or Non-anginal pain
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the 3 inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result (True/False) in the nodes list
4. Traverses the tree based on these conditions to make a prediction
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds and conditions are based on medical knowledge:
- oldpeak > 1.5 indicates significant ST depression
- ca > 0 indicates presence of blocked vessels
- chest_pain types 3 (Typical angina) and 2 (Non-anginal pain) are generally less associated with heart disease than types 0 (Asymptomatic) and 1 (Atypical angina)
