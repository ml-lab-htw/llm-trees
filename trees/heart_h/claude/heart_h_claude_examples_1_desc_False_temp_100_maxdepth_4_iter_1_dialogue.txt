Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the heart disease decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 60
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X["thal"] == 3  # Reversible defect
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 60
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            if nodes[3]:  # thalach <= 150
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[4]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # chest_pain is not Asymptomatic
            if nodes[5]:  # thal is Reversible defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of each node condition
3. Evaluates each condition based on the feature thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on medical literature and typical ranges for these values:
- oldpeak (ST depression) threshold of 1.5 mm is
