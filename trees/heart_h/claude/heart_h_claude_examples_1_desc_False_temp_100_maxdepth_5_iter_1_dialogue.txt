Based on the feature descriptions and encodings provided, here's the decision tree prediction function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check ST depression (oldpeak)
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second level: Check number of vessels
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Third level: Check age
            nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 52
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                # Fourth level: Check max heart rate
                nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 150
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            # Third level: Check chest pain type
            nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # Second level: Check thalassemia
        nodes[5] = X["thal"] == 3  # Reversible defect
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            # Third level: Check exercise induced angina
            if X["exang"] == 2:  # yes
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided
3. Returns both the prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node
4. Uses reasonable threshold values based on medical knowledge
5. Implements the same logic as the decision tree shown earlier, but with the proper feature names and encodings
6. Has a maximum depth of
