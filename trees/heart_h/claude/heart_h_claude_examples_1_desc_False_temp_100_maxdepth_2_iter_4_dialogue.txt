Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the main features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: ST Depression (oldpeak) <= 1.5
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    
    # Second decision node: Number of Major Vessels (ca) <= 0
    nodes[1] = X['ca'] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If ST Depression <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If Number of Major Vessels <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # If Number of Major Vessels > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # If ST Depression > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean results of the conditions
3. Evaluates whether ST Depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. If true, evaluates whether Number of Major Vessels (ca) is <= 0
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node results

The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 0 for ca) are clinically relevant values:
- oldpeak > 1.5 mm is generally considered significant ST depression
- Any number of colored vessels (ca > 0) indicates some level of coronary artery disease
