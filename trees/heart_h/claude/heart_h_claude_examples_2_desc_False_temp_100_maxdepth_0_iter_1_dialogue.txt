Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for heart disease prediction. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X['ca'] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X['thalach'] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X['age'] <= 55
    nodes[4] = X['chest_pain'] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X['chol'] <= 240
    nodes[6] = X['age'] <= 60

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[6]:
            if X['exang'] == 1:  # No Exercise Induced Angina
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if X['thal'] == 2:  # Normal
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree based on the most important features for heart disease prediction. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names, and returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for No Heart Disease, 1 for Heart Disease) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The function uses the following features:
1. 'oldpeak' (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest)
2. 'ca'
