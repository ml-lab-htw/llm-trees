Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Heart Disease Absent
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease Present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as we have 2 inner nodes in our depth-2 tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The first condition checks if "oldpeak" (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is <= 1.5.

4. The second condition checks if "thalach" (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is <= 150 bpm.

5. Based on these conditions, we make the prediction:
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach <= 150, predict Heart Disease Present (1)
   - If oldpeak <= 1.5 and thalach > 150, predict Heart Disease Absent (0)
   - If oldpeak > 1.5, predict Heart Disease Present (1)

6. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (1 for Heart Disease Present, 0 for Heart Disease Absent) and the list of node condition results.

This function implements the decision tree as described earlier, using the correct feature keys and adhering to the target encoding (1 for yes, 0 for no) for heart disease prediction.
