Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that focuses on the most important features for heart disease prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[2] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[3] = X["ca"] <= 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach <= 150
            if nodes[2]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
                prediction = 1  # Disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No disease
        else:  # thalach > 150
            prediction = 0  # No disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[3]:  # ca <= 1
            if nodes[2]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
                prediction = 1  # Disease present
            elif X["thal"] == 3:  # Reversible defect
                prediction = 1  # Disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No disease
        else:  # ca > 1
            prediction = 1  # Disease present
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of each node condition
3. Evaluates the conditions using the most important features:
   - ST depression (oldpeak)
   - Maximum heart rate (thalach)
   - Chest pain type (chest_pain)
   - Number of vessels (ca)
   - Thalassemia (thal)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on medical knowledge and typical ranges
