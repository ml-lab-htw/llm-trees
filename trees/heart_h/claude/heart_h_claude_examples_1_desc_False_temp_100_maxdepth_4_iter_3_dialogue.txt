Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that matches your format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for 4 inner nodes
    
    # Define the conditions for each node using the exact feature names and encodings
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # thalach <= 150
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:  # thalach > 150
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            if nodes[3]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:  # chest_pain is not Asymptomatic
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition using the proper feature names and encodings
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses meaningful thresholds based on medical knowledge:
   - oldpeak (ST depression) threshold of 1.5 mm
   - ca (number of vessels) threshold of 0
   - thalach (max heart rate) threshold of 150 bpm
   - chest_pain type checking for Asymptomatic (0)
