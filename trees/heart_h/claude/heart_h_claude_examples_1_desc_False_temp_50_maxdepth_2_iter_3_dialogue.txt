Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the key features, maintaining the exact feature names and value encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. First checks if ST depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
4. If oldpeak is <= 1.5, then checks the number of major vessels (ca)
5. Makes a prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease)
6. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions

The thresholds chosen are:
- oldpeak: 1.5 (clinically relevant threshold for ST depression)
- ca: 0 (presence or absence of affected vessels)

These thresholds are based on medical literature where:
- ST depression > 1.5mm is considered significant for ischemia
- Any number of affected vessels (ca > 0) indicates presence of coronary artery disease
