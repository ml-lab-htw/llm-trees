Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the same structure as before but with properly formatted feature names and sensible thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Using oldpeak (ST Depression) as primary split with threshold 1.5
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Using ca (Number of Major Vessels) as second split with threshold 0
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    # Using age as third split with threshold 52
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 52
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 52
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:  # age > 52
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if X["thalach"] <= 150:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Uses proper feature names from the provided list
2. Uses appropriate thresholds based on the feature descriptions
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node conditions
4. Follows the same structure as the previous tree but with correct variable names and encodings
5. Uses sensible threshold values based on medical knowledge:
   - oldpeak (ST depression) threshold of 1.5 mm
   - ca (number of vessels) threshold of 0
   - age threshold of 52 years
   - thalach (maximum heart rate) threshold of 150 bpm
