Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Primary split on ST depression (oldpeak)
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Left branch
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                nodes[3] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            nodes[4] = X["thalach"] <= 150
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # Right branch
        nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2  # Yes for exercise induced angina
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            if X["thal"] == 3:  # Reversible defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each internal node
4. Uses realistic threshold values based on medical knowledge
5. Follows the same structure as the previously shown tree but now with the correct feature names and encodings

The thresholds and conditions used are:
- oldpeak (ST depression) <= 1.5 mm
- ca (number of vessels) <= 0
- age <= 55 years
- chest_pain == 0 (Asymp
