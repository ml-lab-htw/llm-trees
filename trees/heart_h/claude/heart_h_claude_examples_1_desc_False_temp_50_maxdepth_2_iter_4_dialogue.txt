I'll create a Python function for the heart disease decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5  # ST Depression threshold
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0.5       # Number of major vessels threshold
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ST Depression <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of vessels <= 0.5
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # Number of vessels > 0.5
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # ST Depression > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature key "oldpeak" for ST Depression
2. Uses the correct feature key "ca" for Number of Major Vessels
3. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (1 = yes, 0 = no for heart disease)
4. Returns a list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition in the inner nodes
5. Uses meaningful thresholds:
   - 1.5 for ST Depression (oldpeak), as this is a clinically relevant threshold
   - 0.5 for number of vessels (ca), which effectively separates patients with no affected vessels (0) from those with one or more affected vessels (1,2,3)

The function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns both the prediction and the list of node evaluations, following the exact format of your example.
