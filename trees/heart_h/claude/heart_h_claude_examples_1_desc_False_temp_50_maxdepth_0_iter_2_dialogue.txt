Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll convert the decision tree into a Python function. I'll adjust the thresholds according to the actual feature ranges and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 150
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[3] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2       # 2 = yes

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach > 150
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 55
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:  # thalach <= 150
            if nodes[3]:  # ca <= 0
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[4]:  # chest_pain == Asymptomatic
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[5]:  # exang == yes
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Evaluates each condition based on the feature thresholds and encodings
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds and conditions are adjusted to match the provided feature encodings:
- chest_pain: 0 represents Asymp
