Based on the provided feature names and their encodings, I'll create a decision function for the heart disease prediction tree that uses 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the main predictors:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ST Depression <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of Major Vessels <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # ST Depression > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list to store the binary results of the decision nodes
3. Uses realistic threshold values:
   - oldpeak (ST Depression) threshold of 1.5 mm (clinically significant)
   - ca (Number of Major Vessels) threshold of 0 (presence vs. absence of diseased vessels)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the list of node results

The function maintains the same tree structure as previously shown but now properly uses the exact feature names and follows the specified encoding format.
