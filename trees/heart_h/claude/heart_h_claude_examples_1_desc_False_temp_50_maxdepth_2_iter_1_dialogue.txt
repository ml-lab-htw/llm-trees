Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function using 'oldpeak' (ST Depression) and 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels) as the main features, similar to my previous tree but now with the correct feature names and encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: ST Depression (oldpeak) <= 1.5
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second decision node: Number of Major Vessels (ca) <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If ca <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # If ca > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # If oldpeak > 1.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates two conditions:
   - First node checks if ST depression (oldpeak) is <= 1.5
   - Second node checks if number of major vessels (ca) is <= 0
4. Makes a prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) based on these conditions
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node results

The thresholds (1.5 for oldpeak and 0 for ca) are chosen based on medical literature and typical clinical significance:
- An ST depression > 1.5 mm is often considered clinically significant
- Any major vessels affected (ca > 0) indicates some level of coronary artery disease
