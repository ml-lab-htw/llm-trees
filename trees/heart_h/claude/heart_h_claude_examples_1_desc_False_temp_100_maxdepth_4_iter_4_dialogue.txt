Based on the provided feature names and encodings, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]  # Initialize list for 6 inner nodes
    
    # Decision nodes using the exact feature names and value encodings
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 55
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[4] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2       # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 55
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # ca > 0
            if nodes[3]:  # thalach <= 150
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[4]:  # chest_pain is Asymptomatic
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # chest_pain is not Asymptomatic
            if nodes[5]:  # exang is yes
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list for tracking the truth values of inner nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions using the exact feature names and encodings provided
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses meaningful threshold values based on medical knowledge:
   - oldpeak (ST depression) threshold of 1.5
   - age threshold of 55
