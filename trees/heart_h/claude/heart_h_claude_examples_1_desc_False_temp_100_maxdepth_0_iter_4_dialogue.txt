Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 60
    nodes[3] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical angina
    nodes[4] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[6] = X["thal"] == 2  # Normal
    
    if nodes[0]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # ca <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # age <= 60
                prediction = 0
            else:  # age > 60
                if nodes[3]:  # chest_pain == Typical angina
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 1
        else:  # ca > 0
            if nodes[4]:  # thalach <= 150
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # oldpeak > 1.5
        if nodes[5]:  # exang == yes
            prediction = 1
        else:  # exang == no
            if nodes[6]:  # thal == Normal
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Uses the correct encodings for categorical variables
3. Uses reasonable threshold values for numerical variables
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each node condition
5. Follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, but adapted to use the exact feature names and encodings specified

The thresholds and conditions are selected based on medical knowledge and typical ranges for
