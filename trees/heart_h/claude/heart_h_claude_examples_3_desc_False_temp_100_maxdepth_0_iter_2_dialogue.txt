Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I created earlier, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X['ca'] <= 0
    nodes[2] = X['thalach'] <= 150
    nodes[3] = X['age'] <= 55
    nodes[4] = X['chest_pain'] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    nodes[5] = X['exang'] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[6] = X['chol'] <= 240

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for No Heart Disease, 1 for Heart Disease)
2. A list of 7 boolean values (as integers) representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The thresholds and conditions in this function are based on the decision tree I created earlier, with some adjustments to match the exact feature names and encodings provided in your description.

Note that this is a simplified decision tree and may not capture
