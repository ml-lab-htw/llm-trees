```python

    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] > 2  # Thalassemia - Reversible defect suggests higher risk
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 0  # Number of major vessels - more vessels indicate higher risk

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Likely heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Still likely, but slightly less
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Likely
        else:

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Thresholds:**

I've selected "thal" (Thalassemia) and "ca" (Number of Major Vessels) as the most important features for this hypothetical heart disease prediction, based on general medical knowledge.  

* **thal:** A "reversible defect" (thal = 3) in Thalassemia can indicate underlying heart issues. So, I've used `X["thal"] > 2` as the condition.
* **ca:**  The number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy ("ca") is often an indicator of heart disease severity. A higher number of affected vessels typically suggests a higher risk.  So, I've used  `X["ca"] > 0` as the condition.


**Important Note:**  This decision tree is constructed *without any actual data*.  It is based on a reasoned guess of which features might be important.  The thresholds (e.g., `> 2`, `> 0`) are also educated guesses.   To create a truly useful decision tree, you **must** train it on a real dataset using a machine learning algorithm.  This example just illustrates the desired output format and a basic logical structure. Using a maximum depth of 2 makes the resulting decision tree highly likely to underfit any real world data.  You typically need considerably more depth to capture more complex patterns.
