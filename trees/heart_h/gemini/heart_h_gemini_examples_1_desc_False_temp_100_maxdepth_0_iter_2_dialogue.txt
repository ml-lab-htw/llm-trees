        if nodes[1]:

**Explanation and Justification (repeated from previous response, adapted to the code):**

* **chest_pain == 0:** This checks for asymptomatic chest pain, which is a strong indicator.
* **ca >= 1:**  This checks if at least one major vessel is colored by fluoroscopy.  If combined with asymptomatic chest pain, this increases the likelihood of heart disease.
* **oldpeak > 1.0:** For those *without* asymptomatic chest pain, ST depression during exercise is used. A value greater than 1.0 is considered a potential indicator, though this threshold is an estimate.

**Important Considerations (repeated from previous response):**

* **This tree is simplified.** Real-world diagnosis is far more complex.
* **Feature importance is assumed.** This tree is not trained. Feature selection and thresholds are based on general medical knowledge and not data-driven.
* **Thresholds are estimated.**  The value 1.0 for `oldpeak` is an example.  Optimal thresholds would be learned from data in a real-world application.


This function directly implements the decision tree logic described previously, providing both a prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes. Remember that this is a demonstration and a real model would need to be trained on data for reliable predictions.
