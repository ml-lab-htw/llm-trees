**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** Reasonable thresholds are added based on medical context.  These would be learned from data in a real-world scenario.
* **String Comparison for Sex:** The code now correctly handles string input for the "sex" feature, assuming "male" and "female" as inputs.  Adjust if your data uses different encoding.
* **Expanded Node List:** The `nodes` list has been expanded to accommodate all the decision points in the hypothetical tree.
* **Clearer Structure:** The nested `if/else` statements directly reflect the branching logic of the provided decision tree, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Type Hinting (Optional):**  While not strictly necessary, type hinting (`X: dict`) makes the code more readable.



**How to use the function:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'age': 65, 'sex': 'male', 'chest_pain': 0, 'trestbps': 150, 'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 2, 'restecg': 2, 'thalach': 160, 'exang': 1, 'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2, 'ca': 1, 'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False, True, True, True, False, ...]
```

Remember, this function is based on a *hypothetical* decision tree.  For accurate predictions, train a decision tree classifier on a real dataset using scikit-learn. I can provide assistance with that if you have the data.
