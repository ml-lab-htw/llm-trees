Explanation of feature selection and thresholds:

The features and thresholds chosen are based on general medical knowledge about heart disease risk factors.  The idea is to create a plausible decision tree *without using any actual data*.

* **thal (Thalassemia):**  A defect (values 1 and 3) are generally associated with higher risk.
* **ca (Number of Major Vessels):** More major vessels colored by fluoroscopy generally indicates more severe coronary artery disease and hence a higher risk.
* **age:** Older age is a major risk factor for heart disease.
* **chol (Cholesterol):**  Higher cholesterol levels are associated with higher risk.
* **oldpeak (ST Depression):** A significant ST depression induced by exercise is a strong indicator of heart disease.


The tree structure and the predicted values (0 or 1) are arbitrary within the constraints of the prompt.  The point is to demonstrate the format and a plausible, though untuned and untrained, decision tree based on the given features.  A real decision tree would require training on actual data to optimize its structure and predictive accuracy.
