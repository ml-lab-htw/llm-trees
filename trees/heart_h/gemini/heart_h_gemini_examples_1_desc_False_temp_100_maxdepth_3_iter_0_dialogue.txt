def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of nodes

    # Node 0: Chest Pain Type
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic

    # Node 1: ST Depression (if Chest Pain is Asymptomatic)
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0 if nodes[0] else None

    # Node 2: Number of Major Vessels (if Chest Pain is NOT Asymptomatic)
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] > 0 if not nodes[0] else None

    if nodes[0]:  # Chest pain is Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]: # ST Depression > 2
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:  # Chest pain is NOT Asymptomatic
        if nodes[2]: # Number of major vessels > 0
            prediction = 1 # Heart Disease
        else:
            if X["age"] > 60:
                prediction = 1 # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0 # No Heart Disease


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable thresholds based on medical context (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `age > 60`). These are still examples and would need adjustment with real data.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the boolean results of each decision node's condition.  `None` is used if a node isn't reached.
* **Target Encoding:** The function now returns 1 for heart disease and 0 for no heart disease, consistent with the prompt's encoding.
* **Feature Names:** The code uses the correct feature names provided in the prompt.

**Important Considerations (reiterated):**

* **No Training:** This function does *not* learn from data. It's a hardcoded decision tree based on assumptions.  Real-world applications would require training on a dataset.
* **Simplified Model:** This model is greatly simplified for demonstration within the depth-3 constraint. It omits many important features.  A robust model should use more features and a potentially greater depth.
* **Medical Disclaimer:** This code should **not** be used for actual medical diagnosis. It's a simplified example for educational purposes only.  Consult with medical professionals for real-world diagnosis and treatment.


This improved function provides a better, more functional representation of the decision tree logic, although it remains a simplified example for illustrative purposes.
