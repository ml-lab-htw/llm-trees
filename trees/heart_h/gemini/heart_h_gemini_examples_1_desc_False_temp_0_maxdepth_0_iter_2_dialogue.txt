**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  Reasonable threshold values have been added based on medical context (e.g., `oldpeak >= 2.0`, `age >= 60`). These can be further refined with data analysis and model training.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code now correctly handles the specified feature encoding (e.g., chest pain types, sex as a string).
* **Boolean to Integer Conversion:** The `nodes` list is explicitly converted to integers (1 or 0) at the end, matching the requested format.
* **Simplified Structure:** The nested `if/else` structure directly mirrors the logic of the hypothetical decision tree, making the code clearer and easier to understand.
* **Real-World Application:**  Remember, this function is still based on a hypothetical tree. To achieve optimal performance, you *must* train a decision tree classifier on a real dataset using `scikit-learn` or a similar library.  The resulting tree will likely have a different structure and thresholds than this example.


This improved version addresses the format and logic requirements while maintaining the structure of the provided hypothetical decision tree.  Using it with real patient data will provide more accurate and reliable results.  It's crucial to evaluate the performance of any machine learning model on a separate test set to estimate its real-world effectiveness.
