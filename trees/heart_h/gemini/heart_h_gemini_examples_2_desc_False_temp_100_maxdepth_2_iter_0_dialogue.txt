def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150  # Maximum Heart Rate threshold

    if nodes[0]:  # Typical angina path
        if nodes[1]:  # Low heart rate
            prediction = 1  # Likely heart disease
        else:  # High heart rate
            prediction = 0  # Less likely heart disease
    else:  # Other chest pain types
        if nodes[1]:  # Low heart rate
            prediction = 0  # Less likely heart disease
        else:  # High heart rate
            prediction = 1  # More likely heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 2 * [None]`: Creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, both initialized to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. 

2. **Root Node (Chest Pain):**
   - `nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3`:  This line evaluates if the patient's `chest_pain` feature is equal to 3 (Typical angina). 
      - If `True`, it means the patient has typical angina, and `nodes[0]` is set to 1. 
      - If `False`, the patient has a different chest pain type, and `nodes[0]` is set to 0.

3. **Child Node (Maximum Heart Rate):**
   - `nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150`: This line evaluates if the patient's maximum heart rate (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 150 bpm. 
      - If `True`, `nodes[1]` is set to 1.
      - If `False`, `nodes[1]` is set to 0.

4. **Decision Logic:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision logic based on the truth values in `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`, following the structure you provided:
     - If `nodes[0]` is 1 (Typical angina):
       - If `nodes[1]` is 1 (Low heart rate): Predict heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
       - If `nodes[1]` is 0 (High heart rate): Predict no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
     - If `nodes[0]` is 0 (Other chest pain types):
       - If `nodes[1]` is 1 (Low heart rate): Predict no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
       - If `nodes[1]` is 0 (High heart rate): Predict heart disease (`prediction = 1`).

5. **Return:**
   - `return prediction, nodes`: The function returns the predicted class label (`prediction`) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values of the conditions at the inner nodes.

**Important:**  Remember that this decision tree is based on simplified assumptions and a very small depth. To get a more accurate and reliable model, you would need:

- **More Data:** A larger dataset with more patient records to train the decision tree.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore and potentially create Features that could be more informative for predicting heart disease.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different decision tree depths and other parameters to find the best performing model. 
- **Model Evaluation:**  Thoroughly evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) on a separate test dataset.
