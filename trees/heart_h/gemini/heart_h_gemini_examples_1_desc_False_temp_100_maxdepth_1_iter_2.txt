```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] > 2  # Simplified condition based on feature importance (thal)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # If thal > 2 (reversible defect), predict heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Otherwise, predict no heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of the Decision Tree Generation:**

Since we're building a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 and no training data, we need to create a single split based on one of the provided features. I've chosen the feature "thal" (Thalassemia) for this example.  The rationale is that Thalassemia, particularly the "reversible defect" type, is often associated with heart problems. While this isn't a perfect predictor, it provides a plausible single-split decision logic in the absence of training data.  The split condition `X["thal"] > 2` effectively checks if the Thalassemia type is a "reversible defect" (value 3).

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:**  This decision tree is not trained on any data. It's a purely illustrative example based on a simplified interpretation of the feature "thal". The effectiveness of this tree on real-world data would depend on the actual relationship between Thalassemia and heart disease in the dataset.
* **Feature Importance:** In a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined by training a model on actual data. Here, I've made an assumption about the importance of "thal" for demonstration purposes.
* **Depth 1 Limitation:**  The depth restriction to 1 severely limits the tree's complexity.  A deeper tree with more splits would likely be more accurate on real-world data.


This generated function takes a dictionary of features `X` as input and returns a prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.  The `nodes` list in this case will contain a single element (True or False) based on the evaluation of the condition `X["thal"] > 2`.
