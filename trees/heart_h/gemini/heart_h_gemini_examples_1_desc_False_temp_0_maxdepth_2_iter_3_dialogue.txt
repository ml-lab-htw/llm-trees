**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've set reasonable threshold values for `oldpeak` and `ca` based on general medical understanding.  However, these should ideally be determined through data analysis (e.g., finding optimal splits based on Gini impurity or information gain).
* **Chest Pain:** I incorporated the chest pain type into the branch where `oldpeak` is low, as it provides additional discriminating power in cases where ST depression is not significant. I group Asymptomatic and Atypical Angina together, and Typical and Non-anginal pain together based on likelihood of having heart disease.
* **Integer Node Values:** The `nodes` list is now converted to integers (0 or 1) as requested.
* **Example Usage:** Added example usages with two different patient profiles to demonstrate how the function works.


This improved function more closely aligns with the provided specifications and incorporates more domain knowledge for potentially better predictions.  Remember that optimal performance requires training and evaluation on a real dataset.
