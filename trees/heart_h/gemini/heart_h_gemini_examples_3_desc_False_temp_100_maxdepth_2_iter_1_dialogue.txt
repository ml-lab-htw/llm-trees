def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None] 
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] > 0  
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 153.5 
    nodes[2] = X["age"] > 54.5  

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 
    else:
        if nodes[1]: 
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0 
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Assumptions:**

* **Feature Importance (Assumed):**  Without a dataset, I'm using general medical knowledge to assume these are important features for heart disease and thresholds:
    * **`ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy):** A higher number of blocked vessels strongly indicates heart disease.
    * **`thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved):**  Lower maximum heart rate during exercise can be a sign of heart problems.
    * **`age`:** Heart disease risk increases with age.
* **Thresholds:**
    * `ca > 0`:  Presence of even one blocked vessel is significant.
    * `thalach <= 153.5`:  This is a hypothetical threshold.  A real value would depend on the dataset and other factors.
    * `age > 54.5`: Again, this is a simplified threshold.

**How to Use the Function:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3, 
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 140,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,  
    'thal': 2 
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction (1=Heart Disease, 0=No Heart Disease): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values of Conditions): {nodes}") 
```

**Important:**

* This decision tree is for illustrative purposes. **Never use it for actual medical decisions.**
* With a real dataset, I could use statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to determine feature importance and optimal thresholds for a more accurate and reliable model.
