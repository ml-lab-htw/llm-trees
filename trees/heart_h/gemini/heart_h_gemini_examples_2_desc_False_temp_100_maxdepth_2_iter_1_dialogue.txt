**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The `predict(X: dict)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys are feature names and values are the patient's feature values.

2. **Node Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 2 * [None]`: Creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of our decision tree.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):**
     - `X["ca"] > 0`: This is our first decision node. It checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is greater than 0. 
     - If `True`, it suggests a higher risk of heart disease.
   - **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):**
     -  `X["thalach"] <= 140`: This node is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `False`. It checks if the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 140 bpm.
     - A lower maximum heart rate can be associated with heart problems.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements determine the final prediction based on the truth values in the `nodes` list. 
   - In this example, if `ca` is greater than 0, the prediction is 1 (heart disease) regardless of `thalach`. 
   - If `ca` is 0 or less, the prediction depends on whether `thalach` is less than or equal to 140.

5. **Return:**
   - The function returns a tuple: `(prediction, nodes)`
     - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease).
     - `nodes`: The list containing the truth values of the inner nodes, allowing you to see which conditions were met.

**Important:**

* This decision tree is highly simplified and for illustrative purposes. You **must** replace the example thresholds and feature selections with values obtained from analyzing your heart disease dataset. 
* Consider using machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn) to build more robust decision trees on real-world medical data.
* **Never** use this simplified example for actual medical diagnosis.
