def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical Angina
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 0  # Number of major vessels > 0
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1  # ST Depression > 1
    nodes[3] = X["age"] > 55  # Age > 55

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # High Risk
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # High Risk
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High Risk
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1 # Moderate risk (represented as 1 for simplicity, ideally a different class)
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low Risk

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:** The code now uses the exact feature names and encoding provided in the prompt.  Specifically, `chest_pain` is checked for value 3 (Typical angina).  `ca`, `oldpeak`, and `age` are used with appropriate comparisons.
* **Clearer Logic:** The nested `if/else` structure mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to follow.
* **Risk Representation:** While I've used 1 to represent both High and Moderate Risk for simplicity (as we only have a binary output), a real-world application might benefit from a multi-class output (e.g., 0 for low, 1 for moderate, 2 for high) or probability predictions.
* **Missing Features:** This simplified tree still omits potentially important features.  A more robust model would likely incorporate them, adjusting the tree structure and thresholds accordingly.  Remember, this is a *hypothetical* tree, and a real-world application would require training on a dataset.
* **`nodes` list:** The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values at each decision node, as requested.


This improved function provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the hypothetical decision tree, using the specified feature names, encoding, and returning both the prediction and the node truth values.  Remember to use a proper machine learning pipeline with real data for actual heart disease prediction.
