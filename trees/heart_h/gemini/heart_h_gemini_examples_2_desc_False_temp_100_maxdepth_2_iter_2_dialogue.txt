  Predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient features.

**Explanation:**

* **Depth-2 Tree:** The code implements a decision tree with two levels of decision nodes. 
* **Feature Selection:**  I've chosen 'thalach' (maximum heart rate) and 'chest_pain' as the features for this example. These features are often strong indicators of heart disease. 
* **Thresholds:**
    * `thalach <= 150`:  A lower maximum heart rate might indicate a higher risk of heart disease.
    * `chest_pain == 3`: Typical angina is a strong indicator of heart disease.
* **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision logic of the tree, determining the prediction based on the values of the features at each node.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data Required:** To properly train a decision tree model and determine the most effective thresholds, you need a labeled dataset with patient features and their corresponding heart disease diagnoses. 
* **Model Improvement:**  With a dataset, you can use algorithms like ID3 or CART to learn the optimal tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds, potentially achieving better predictive performance.
* **Evaluation:**  Always evaluate your model's performance on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.

This code provides a starting point for a heart disease prediction function. To create a more robust and accurate model, you'll need to train it on real-world data.
