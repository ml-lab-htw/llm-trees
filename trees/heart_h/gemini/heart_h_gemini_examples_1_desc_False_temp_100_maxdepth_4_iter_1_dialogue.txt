This Python function implements the hypothetical decision tree logic. The `nodes` list keeps track of the boolean results at each decision point, making it possible to trace the path taken for a given input.  Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* tree. The thresholds and feature combinations are based on general medical knowledge but would need to be refined with actual data and model training.  Using a library like scikit-learn is highly recommended if you have a dataset to work with.
