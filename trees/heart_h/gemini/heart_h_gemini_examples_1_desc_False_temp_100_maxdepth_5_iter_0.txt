**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

The generated decision tree prioritizes features likely to be highly indicative of heart disease, creating a hierarchical structure to make predictions:

1. **`thal` (Thalassemia):**  Thalassemias are inherited blood disorders affecting hemoglobin production. Certain types can impact heart health, making it a potentially strong predictor.

2. **`ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy):**  This represents blockages in major arteries, a direct indicator of heart disease risk.

3. **`oldpeak` (ST Depression):**  ST depression on an electrocardiogram during exercise is a significant sign of reduced blood flow to the heart, strongly suggesting potential heart problems.

4. **`age`:** Age is a well-established risk factor for heart disease.

5. **`chol` (Cholesterol):** High cholesterol levels are associated with increased heart disease risk.


The tree structure is designed to assess these factors in order of their perceived importance, branching to consider other factors based on the values of the more important ones.  The generated decision tree uses a series of nested if-else statements to implement the logic, mimicking the structure of a decision tree.

**Important Note:** This decision tree is generated *without any training data*.  It is based on reasonable assumptions about feature importance, but its accuracy cannot be guaranteed.  A real-world application would require training a model on actual data to achieve reliable performance.  The provided code fulfills the prompt's requirements by generating a Python function representing a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 using selected features.
