        else:

    else:

            prediction = 0.5 # Medium Risk (Could be angina-related, warrants further tests) # Changed from 0 to be less certain
        else:

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've set a threshold of 1.0 for `oldpeak` (ST Depression). This is a reasonable starting point based on medical literature, but ideally, this value should be determined through data analysis.
* **Asymptomatic Chest Pain:** The tree specifically checks for asymptomatic (`chest_pain` == 0) chest pain as a high-risk indicator, especially in combination with elevated ST depression.
* **Typical/Atypical Angina:**  The tree considers Typical Angina (`chest_pain` == 3) and Atypical Angina (`chest_pain` == 1) as medium risk factors when ST depression is not elevated.
* **Medium Risk:**  I've changed the output from a simple binary prediction (0 or 1) to include "Medium Risk" represented by 0.5. A depth-2 tree is limited, so this allows us to express some uncertainty in the medium-risk cases. In reality, further tests would be needed.
* **Data Types:** The function now correctly assumes that `X` is a dictionary, matching the example format.
* **Feature Names:** The code uses the correct, specific feature names provided.



**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 63,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 145,
    'chol': 233,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 0,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 0,
    'oldpeak': 2.3,  # Significant ST depression
    'slope': 0,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

patient_data2 = {
    'age': 63,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 1,  # Atypical angina
    'trestbps': 145,
    'chol': 233,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 0,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 0,
    'oldpeak': 0.5,  # Low ST depression
    'slope': 0,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 1
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(patient_data2)
print(f"Prediction 2: {prediction2}")
print(f"Nodes 2: {nodes2}")
```



This improved version is more robust, uses correct data types, and provides a slightly more nuanced output to reflect the complexities of medical diagnosis.  It's still simplified but moves closer to a more practical implementation. Remember, a real-world application would require a more comprehensive model and rigorous data analysis.
