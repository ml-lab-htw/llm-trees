**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:** The code now reflects the decision tree logic in a more readable and understandable way.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  I've added placeholder thresholds (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `thalach < 120`, `age > 60`).  These are just examples based on general medical knowledge and should be refined with actual data analysis.
* **Node Tracking:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the truth values of each decision node, as requested.
* **Example Usage:** I've included an example of how to use the `predict` function with sample patient data.

**Important Note:** This is still a *hypothetical* tree. The actual tree structure and thresholds will be different when you train it on real data. The accuracy of the predictions heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the data used for training. You should use a machine learning library and evaluate its performance rigorously before using it in any real-world application.
