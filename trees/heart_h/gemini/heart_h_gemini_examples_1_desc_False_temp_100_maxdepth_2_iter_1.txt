```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 150  # Using maximum heart rate as a split point
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5 # ST Depression as second split

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Likely heart disease if low max heart rate and high ST depression
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Possibly not heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Likely not heart disease if high max heart rate

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Thresholds:**

For a simplified decision tree related to heart disease without actual data training, I chose `thalach` (maximum heart rate) and `oldpeak` (ST depression) as important features.

* **thalach:**  A lower maximum heart rate achieved during exercise could indicate a heart problem. I set a threshold of 150 bpm.  People unable to reach a higher heart rate during exertion may have heart issues.
* **oldpeak:**  ST depression induced by exercise is a strong indicator of heart disease.  A larger value typically indicates a more severe problem. I've chosen a threshold of > 1.5.  Higher values of ST depression are more concerning.

**Decision Tree Logic:**

The logic is as follows:

1. **Node 0 (thalach):**  If the maximum heart rate is less than or equal to 150 bpm, go to node 1.  Otherwise, predict no heart disease (0).
2. **Node 1 (oldpeak):** If ST depression is greater than 1.5, predict heart disease (1). Otherwise, predict no heart disease (0).


This is a simplified example, and real-world heart disease diagnosis is significantly more complex, requiring more features and sophisticated models.  This function provides a basic demonstration of creating a decision tree with a limited depth based on intuitively relevant features.  Always consult with a medical professional for any health concerns.
