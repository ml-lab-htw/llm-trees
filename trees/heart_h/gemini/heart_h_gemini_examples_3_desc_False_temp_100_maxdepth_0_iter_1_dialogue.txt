**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** I've added specific threshold values to the decision nodes, making the logic more concrete.
* **Feature Encoding Handling:** The code directly uses the provided feature encodings (e.g., 0 for Asymptomatic chest pain).
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree structure is slightly adjusted to improve readability and reflect the provided description more closely. It now aligns with the original illustrative tree while incorporating concrete values.
* **Risk Levels to Binary Output:** The initial illustrative tree had "High Risk," "Medium Risk," and "Low Risk."  This function converts those to a binary output (1 for likely heart disease, 0 for likely not) based on reasonable thresholds.  "Medium Risk" cases are assigned 0 or 1 depending on other factors within that branch of the tree. A real-world model would benefit from more data and features to refine these assignments.
* **List of Truth Values (nodes):** The function returns the `nodes` list, containing boolean values indicating whether each condition in the decision tree is met (1) or not (0).

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 150,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 130,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```


This revised code provides a more functional and illustrative implementation of the decision tree for heart disease prediction. Remember, this is a simplified example and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.  A real diagnostic tool requires rigorous development, validation, and testing on large datasets.
