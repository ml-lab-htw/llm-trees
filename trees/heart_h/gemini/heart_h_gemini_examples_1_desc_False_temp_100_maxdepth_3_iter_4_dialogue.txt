This function represents the hypothetical decision tree discussed earlier, using the provided feature names and reasonable threshold values.  Remember that these thresholds and the tree structure itself are just for demonstration and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.  A real model needs to be trained on data.  Also, the encoding/mapping provided for the features is now used in the function. For example, `chest_pain == 0` refers to "Asymptomatic" chest pain.
