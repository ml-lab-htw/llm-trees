```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic Chest Pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0     # ST Depression > 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if X["ca"] > 0:     # Number of Major Vessels > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes

```

This function directly translates the decision tree logic we discussed previously into Python code.  It uses the specified feature names and thresholds.  The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values of the decision nodes, as requested.  Remember, this is a simplified example and shouldn't be used for real medical diagnoses.
