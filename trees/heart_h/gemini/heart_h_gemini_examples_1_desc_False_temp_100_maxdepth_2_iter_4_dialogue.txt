```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic Chest Pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0      # ST Depression > 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease likely
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Heart Disease less likely
    else:
        if X["ca"] > 0:       # Number of major vessels > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease likely
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Heart Disease less likely

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Usage:** The code directly uses the dictionary keys provided for the features, avoiding any spelling errors.
* **Thresholds:**  A reasonable threshold of 2.0 is used for `oldpeak` (ST depression).  This is still an example and would need adjustment with real data.
* **Consistent Encoding:** The target variable is encoded as 1 for heart disease and 0 for no heart disease, maintaining consistency.
* **No Training:**  As requested, the tree is constructed without any training data.  It's based on assumed feature importance.


**Using the Function:**

You can call the function with a dictionary representing a patient's features:

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 150,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 2,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 160,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 3.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease Likely)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")          # Output: Nodes: [True, True] (Both conditions met)

patient_data2 = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 1,  # Atypical Angina
    'trestbps': 150,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 2,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 160,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Heart Disease less likely)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")          # Output: Nodes: [False, False] (Neither condition met)

```


Remember, this is a simplified example.  Real-world medical diagnosis requires careful consideration of many factors and should be done by trained professionals. This code should not be used for actual medical decision-making.
