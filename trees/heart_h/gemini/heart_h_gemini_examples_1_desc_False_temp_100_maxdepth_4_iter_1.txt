This decision tree uses a combination of features related to Thalassemia, chest pain type, the number of major vessels affected, and ST depression induced by exercise, attempting to create a reasonable (though not trained) decision process.  It biases towards predicting heart disease when "reversible defect" thalassemia is present, as well as when "typical angina" is present in conjunction with other risk factors. The number of major vessels and the degree of ST depression act as further refinement for risk stratification within the tree branches.

Important Note: This decision tree is generated synthetically and is not based on any actual medical data or training. It should not be used for any real-world diagnostic purposes.  Consult with a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.
