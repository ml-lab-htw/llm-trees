Key improvements:

* **Feature Encoding:** Uses the provided feature encoding (e.g., `chest_pain == 0` for asymptomatic).  Assumes "male" and "female" string values for the `sex` feature. Adjust if your data uses different encoding (e.g., 0 and 1).
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  Fills in placeholder thresholds with reasonable values based on general medical knowledge (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `trestbps > 140`, `age > 60`).  These are still just examples and a trained model will determine the optimal thresholds.
* **Expanded Nodes:** Increased the number of `nodes` in the list to match the hypothetical tree's complexity.
* **Clearer Logic:** Improved the conditional statements to more closely reflect the hypothetical tree structure.
* **Return Tuple:** Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values as a tuple, as requested.



Remember, this function is based on a hypothetical tree.  You **must** train a real decision tree model on a dataset to obtain a reliable classifier. This improved version provides a much better template for how to structure the function once you have a trained tree and its logic.  You would then replace the arbitrary thresholds and conditions with the ones learned by your model.
