**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, both initialized to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions evaluated at each inner node of our decision tree.

2. **Feature Selection and Thresholds:**
   - The code assumes `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) and `chest_pain` (Chest Pain Type) are the two most important features. **You might need to change these features and thresholds based on your data analysis.**
   - `nodes[0] = X['thalach'] <= 150`: This line evaluates if the patient's maximum heart rate is less than or equal to 150 bpm. The result (True/False) is stored in `nodes[0]`.
   - `nodes[1] = X['chest_pain'] == 3`: This line checks if the patient experiences typical angina (Chest Pain Type = 3). The result is stored in `nodes[1]`.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision tree logic based on the truth values in `nodes`:
     - If `nodes[0]` is True (heart rate <= 150 bpm), we further check `nodes[1]`.
       - If `nodes[1]` is True (typical angina), the prediction is 1 (likely heart disease).
       - If `nodes[1]` is False (other chest pain types), the prediction is 0 (lower risk).
     - If `nodes[0]` is False (heart rate > 150 bpm), the prediction is 0 (lower risk).

4. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted heart disease outcome (1 or 0).
     - `nodes`: The list containing the truth values of the inner node conditions, allowing you to see the decision path taken for a given input.

**Important:**

* **Feature Importance:** This code uses `thalach` and `chest_pain` with a specific threshold for demonstration. You **must** perform feature importance analysis on your data to determine the most relevant features and appropriate thresholds for your decision tree.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** The effectiveness of this decision tree depends entirely on the quality of your data and how well these features can actually separate heart disease cases from non-cases. 
* **Overfitting:** A depth-2 decision tree is likely an oversimplification for a complex problem like heart disease prediction. Consider more complex trees or other machine learning models for potentially better performance.
