**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Encoding:** The code now explicitly uses the provided feature encodings (e.g., `chest_pain == 0` for asymptomatic).
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  A threshold of `oldpeak > 2.0` is used for ST depression, and `ca >= 1` for blocked vessels. These are still examples; optimal values would be learned from data.
* **Depth 2 Structure:** The code adheres to the depth 2 requirement, with two main branches based on `chest_pain` and subsequent branches based on `oldpeak` or `ca`.
* **Example Usage:** The included examples demonstrate how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.


This revised version is more robust, understandable, and closer to a real-world implementation.  Remember, for accurate predictions, you'll need to train a decision tree model on a real dataset. This code provides a functional structure based on reasonable assumptions.
