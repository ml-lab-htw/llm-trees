**Explanation:**

1. **`predict(X: dict)`:**  The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where keys are the feature names (e.g., 'age', 'chest_pain') and values are the corresponding patient data.

2. **`nodes = 3 * [None]`:**  We initialize a list called `nodes` to store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node in the decision tree.  Since we have a depth of 2 (potentially 3 decision points), we create a list with 3 elements.

3. **Node 0: Chest Pain:**  
   - `nodes[0] = X['chest_pain'] == 3` 
     - This checks if the patient has "Typical Angina" (encoded as 3 in your description).
     - If True, it suggests a higher likelihood of heart disease.

4. **Node 1:  ST Depression (conditional):**
   - `if nodes[0]:` 
     - This branch is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is True (patient has typical angina).
   - `nodes[1] = X['oldpeak'] > 1.0`
     - Checks if ST Depression induced by exercise is greater than 1.0 (a simplified threshold). A higher value suggests a higher risk.

5. **Node 2: Age and Sex (conditional):**
   - `else:` 
     - This branch is evaluated if `nodes[0]` is False (patient does NOT have typical angina).
   - `nodes[2] = X['age'] > 50 and X['sex'] == 'male'` 
     - Checks for a combination of age over 50 and male sex, which are known risk factors.

6. **Prediction:**
   -  The `if/elif/else` block determines the final prediction (0 or 1) based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.

**Important:**

* **Simplified Thresholds:** The thresholds used in this example (e.g., `oldpeak > 1.0`) are simplified for illustration. In a real model, you'd determine the best thresholds based on data analysis.
