**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:**  The function directly uses the encoded values for `chest_pain` as described in your feature description.

2. **Thresholds:** A threshold of `1.5` is used for `oldpeak` (ST depression).  This is still a placeholder, but it's a more reasonable starting point based on general medical knowledge.  Optimal thresholds would be learned from data.

3. **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure now directly reflects the decision tree logic outlined previously.

4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list accurately records the truth values of the inner nodes (0 or 1).

**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 200,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```

**Important Note:** This function is still a *simplified example*. It's essential to train a real decision tree model on a dataset to get reliable and accurate predictions.  This improved function provides a better structure and more reasonable placeholder values but should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.
