```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic chest pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5 # ST depression > 1.5 (adjust threshold as needed)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease likely if asymptomatic chest pain and high ST depression
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Less likely if ST depression is low
    else:
        if X["ca"] > 0: # Number of major vessels blocked > 0
            prediction = 1 # Heart disease more likely if vessels blocked
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Less likely if no vessels blocked


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** A threshold of 1.5 is used for `oldpeak` (ST depression). This value is a reasonable starting point based on medical literature, but tuning it on a real dataset would be crucial.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The code directly uses the provided feature encodings (e.g., 0 for asymptomatic chest pain).
* **Clarity and Comments:**  The code includes comments explaining the logic and the features used at each node.
* **Target Encoding:** The function now correctly returns 1 for predicted heart disease and 0 for no heart disease, aligning with the provided target encoding.


**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 150,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 140,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 2.0, # Significant ST depression
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1, # One blocked vessel
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```

Another example:

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,  # Typical Angina
    'trestbps': 150,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 140,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 0.5, # Low ST depression
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0, # No blocked vessels
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```


This improved function provides a clearer and more functional implementation of the decision tree for heart disease prediction, incorporating the provided feature details and target encoding. Remember, this is still a simplified model, and real-world applications would require more sophisticated approaches.
