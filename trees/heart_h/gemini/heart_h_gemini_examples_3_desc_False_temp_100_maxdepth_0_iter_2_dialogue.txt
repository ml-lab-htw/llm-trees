```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic chest pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0      # ST depression > 2
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] > 0            # Number of major vessels > 0
    nodes[3] = X["exang"] == 2       # Exercise induced angina (yes=2)


    if nodes[0]:  # Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]: # ST Depression > 2
            prediction = 1 # High Risk
        else: #ST Depression <=2
            if nodes[2]:  # Vessels > 0
                prediction = 1 #High Risk
            else: # Vessels <=0
                prediction = 0 #Low Risk
    else: # Not Asymptomatic
        if X["age"] > 60:
            prediction = 1 # High Risk
        else: #Age <= 60
            if nodes[3]:  # Exercise Induced Angina
                prediction = 1  # High Risk
            else: #No Exercise Induced Angina
                prediction = 0 #Low Risk


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding Alignment:**  The code now uses the exact feature names and encoding provided (e.g., `chest_pain == 0` for asymptomatic).
* **Thresholds:** Reasonable thresholds are added based on general medical knowledge (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `age > 60`).  These would need to be tuned with real data.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The decision tree logic is restructured to be more concise and readable.
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node. This allows for inspection of the decision path.

**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

**Next Steps (with real data):**

1. **Data Preparation:**  Load your heart disease dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Scikit-learn:** Use `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn to train a model on your data.
3. **Feature Importance:** Use `model.feature_importances_` to determine the most important features.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
5. **Optimization:** Tune hyperparameters (like tree depth) using techniques like cross-validation.



If you provide the dataset, I can help you with the Python code for these steps.
