This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree logic provided earlier, using the specified feature names and encoding. It includes reasonable threshold values (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `age > 55`) based on general medical knowledge, although optimal thresholds would be determined by training on a real dataset. The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.  Remember, this is still a hypothetical tree and would need to be trained on real data for accurate heart disease prediction.
