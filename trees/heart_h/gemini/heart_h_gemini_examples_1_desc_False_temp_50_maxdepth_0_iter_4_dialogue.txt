# Example usage (replace with your actual data):
X_example = {
    'age': 65,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 2,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Node List Initialization:** Initialized `nodes` with a larger size to accommodate the more complex tree structure.
* **Feature Access:**  Corrected feature access to use the exact keys provided (e.g., `X["chest_pain"]`).
* **String Comparison:**  Handled string comparison for the `sex` feature (assuming "male" and "female" string values).
* **Threshold Values:** Incorporated more realistic threshold values based on medical considerations (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `age > 60`).
* **Boolean to Integer Conversion:**  Converted boolean values in the `nodes` list to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) to match the requested format.
* **Combined Conditions:** Implemented combined conditions using `or` for the `slope` feature.


This revised function implements the conceptual decision tree logic described earlier, with specific threshold values and correct feature access.  Remember, this is still a *conceptual* example, and a real decision tree needs to be trained on data to be effective.  This function demonstrates how to structure the tree and return the prediction and node activations in the desired format.
