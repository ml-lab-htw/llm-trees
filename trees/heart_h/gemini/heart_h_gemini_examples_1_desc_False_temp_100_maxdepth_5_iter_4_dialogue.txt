This function uses a simplified decision tree based on medically relevant factors for heart disease.  The thresholds (e.g., `ca > 0`, `oldpeak > 2`, `age > 60`) are chosen based on general medical knowledge, but are illustrative and **should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.**  

The `nodes` list tracks the truth value of each decision node, allowing you to see the path the prediction took.  For example, if `nodes` is `[True, False, True, False, False]`, it means the left branch was taken at the first node, the right branch at the second, and so on.

**Crucially, to use this with real data, you would need to train a decision tree on a real dataset** to find the optimal thresholds and structure, as I did in the earlier example using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn. This example is just a demonstration of the requested function format using reasonable placeholder values. Using a hand-crafted tree like this without training on real data will likely not be accurate for real-world prediction.
