```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] <= 2  # Most important feature 1
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0   # Most important feature 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Reasoning for Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

The prompt asks for a decision tree of maximum depth 2 without training on data.  Therefore, we must use heuristics to select features and create splits. I'm assuming "most important features" refers to features likely to be highly correlated with heart disease.

* **Thal (Thalassemia):** Different types of thalassemia can impact heart health. A "reversible defect" (thal = 3) often suggests a more severe condition and therefore a higher likelihood of heart issues. Thus, `thal <= 2` becomes a reasonable split.

* **ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy):** This feature directly relates to heart health.  A higher number of affected vessels generally indicates a more severe condition.  Therefore, `ca <= 0` (no affected vessels) seems like a good second-level split.

* **Tree Structure and Predictions:**  The tree structure follows a simple if-else logic based on the selected features and split points. Since we have no training data, the predictions (0 or 1) at the leaf nodes are somewhat arbitrary.  I've chosen them to reflect the general idea that a higher value for `thal` or `ca` increases the risk of heart disease.


**Important Note:**  This decision tree is created without any training data.  Its accuracy and usefulness are entirely dependent on the validity of the heuristic assumptions made about the features.  To build a truly effective decision tree, you would need to train it on a real dataset using a suitable algorithm.
