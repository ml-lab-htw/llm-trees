```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic Chest Pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.0    # ST depression > 1.0mm

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # High Risk
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Medium Risk  (Could also be 1, depending on desired risk aversion)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # High Risk
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Low Risk

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Refinements:**

* **Feature Encoding:**  The provided encoding for `chest_pain` is used directly.  `oldpeak` is a continuous value, so we use a threshold of 1.0mm, a common cutoff for significant ST depression.
* **Risk Levels:**  The predictions are encoded as 1 for high/medium risk and 0 for low risk. You can adjust the medium risk prediction to 1 if you want a more conservative model.
* **Missing Values:**  In a real-world application, you would need to handle potential missing values in the input data.  This could involve imputation, assigning a default value, or creating a separate branch in the decision tree.
* **Improved Tree:** While the prompt asked for a depth-2 tree without training, a slightly more sophisticated tree could be beneficial. For example, if `chest_pain` is *not* asymptomatic, checking `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) or `exang` (exercise-induced angina) could refine the risk stratification further.  However, this would require increasing the tree depth or complexity.


This revised function provides a more complete and practically usable implementation of the decision tree based on the given constraints and feature encodings. Remember that this is still a simplified model and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.  Building a robust model requires training on real patient data using machine learning algorithms.
