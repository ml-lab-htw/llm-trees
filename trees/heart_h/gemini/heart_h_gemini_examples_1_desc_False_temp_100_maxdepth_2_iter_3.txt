```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] <= 2  # Thalassemia <= Normal (or Fixed defect)
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0 # Number of major vessels colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0


    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely no heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Likely heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Likely heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Logic:**

I've chosen "thal" (Thalassemia) and "ca" (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) as potentially important features for predicting heart disease.  Here's the reasoning:

* **thal (Thalassemia):**  Thalassemia is a blood disorder that can affect heart health. A normal or fixed defect (thal <= 2) might indicate a lower risk of heart disease, whereas reversible defects often suggest underlying cardiac issues.
* **ca (Number of Major Vessels):** The number of major vessels with blockages (colored by fluoroscopy) is a strong indicator of heart disease risk.  0 vessels colored likely indicates a lower risk, whereas any vessels colored suggests higher risk.

The decision tree logic is structured as follows:

1. **Node 0 (thal <= 2):** Checks if Thalassemia is normal or a fixed defect.
2. **Node 1 (ca <= 0):** Checks if there are zero major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.

This structure prioritizes the Thalassemia result.  If it suggests a potential issue (thal > 2), the prediction is immediately 1 (likely heart disease). Otherwise, the number of colored vessels is considered, further refining the prediction.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Data or Training:** This decision tree is constructed based on *assumed feature importance*, not actual data.  Real-world data and training are crucial for building an effective model.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The logic is simplified to fit the depth 2 requirement. A more complex and accurate tree would likely be deeper and consider interactions between multiple features.  
* **Feature Importance is an Assumption:**  The selection of "thal" and "ca" as important features is based on general medical knowledge, but might not be the most relevant features in a real dataset. Feature importance should be determined through analysis and feature selection techniques when training a real model.


This generated function fulfills the prompt's requirements by providing a Python function that creates a decision tree of maximum depth 2, uses the provided features, makes a prediction, and returns a list of truth values for the internal nodes. However, without training on real data, its predictive accuracy is uncertain.  Always train decision tree models on appropriate data for reliable results.
