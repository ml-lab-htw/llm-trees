```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize the list to store truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic

    if nodes[0]:  # High ST depression
        if nodes[1]:  # Asymptomatic
            prediction = 1  # Likely heart disease
        else:  # Not asymptomatic
            prediction = 1 # Possibly heart disease (erring on side of caution with high ST depression)
    else:  # Low ST depression
        if X["chest_pain"] == 3 or X["chest_pain"] == 1:  # Typical or atypical angina
            prediction = 1 # Possibly heart disease
        else:  # Non-anginal or asymptomatic
            prediction = 0 # Likely no heart disease


    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Thresholds:** The threshold for `oldpeak` (ST depression) is set to 2.0, which is a reasonable value based on medical guidelines, but a true threshold should be determined from data analysis.  The `chest_pain` values correspond to the provided encoding.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The decision logic is simplified for this two-level tree.  A more robust model would incorporate more features and potentially probabilistic outputs.
* **No Training:** This function implements a *predefined* decision tree, not a trained one. Its performance will depend on how well these chosen features and thresholds generalize to real-world data.
* **Medical Disclaimer:**  This function is for illustrative purposes only and **should not be used for self-diagnosis or treatment**.  Real-world medical diagnosis is significantly more complex.  Always consult with a healthcare professional.


This revised function now returns the prediction (0 or 1) *and* the list `nodes` containing the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions at the inner nodes, as requested. This allows you to trace the path taken through the tree for a given input.
