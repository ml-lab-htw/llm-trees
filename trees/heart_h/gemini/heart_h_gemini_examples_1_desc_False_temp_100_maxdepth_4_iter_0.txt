Important Considerations:

* **No Training Data:**  This code generates a *hypothetical* decision tree structure. It does not learn from any data. The choices of features and thresholds are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only.  A real decision tree would be trained on a dataset to determine the best splits.
* **Feature Importance:**  I've made assumptions about feature importance based on general medical knowledge (e.g., thalassemia, typical angina, ST depression, and age are often relevant in heart disease).  A real model would use a feature importance metric derived from training data.
* **Depth and Nodes:** The code creates a tree that can go up to a depth of 4, but it might not always use all 15 inner nodes.  The structure is designed to illustrate how to create a more complex nested `if/else` structure based on node conditions.
* **Python Function Format:** The code adheres to the requested format, returning the prediction and a list of node truth values.


To use this function, you would pass a dictionary of feature values:

```python
example_patient = {
    "age": 65,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 150,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 0,
    "thalach": 160,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.0,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
