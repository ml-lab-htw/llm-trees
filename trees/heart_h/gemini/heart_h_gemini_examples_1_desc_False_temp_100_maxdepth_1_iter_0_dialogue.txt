```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree

    # Using chest pain as the deciding feature
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
