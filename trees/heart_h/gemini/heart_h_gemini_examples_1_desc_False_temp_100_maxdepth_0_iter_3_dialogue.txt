    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic Chest Pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.0   # ST Depression > 1.0

    if nodes[0]:  # Chest pain is asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # ST Depression > 1.0
            prediction = 1  # Likely heart disease
        else:         # ST Depression <= 1.0
            prediction = 0  # Less likely heart disease
    else:        # Chest pain is NOT asymptomatic
        if X["chest_pain"] == 3:  # Typical Angina
            prediction = 1  # Likely heart disease
        else:                  # Other types of chest pain
            prediction = 0  # Less likely heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Encoding:** The code now directly uses the provided integer encoding for `chest_pain`.
* **Specific Threshold:** A threshold of 1.0 is used for `oldpeak` (ST Depression).  This value is a reasonable starting point based on medical considerations, but ideally, it would be determined through data analysis.
* **Improved Logic:** The `if/else` structure is more aligned with the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.
* **Consistent Return Values:** The function always returns a prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values.

This revised function provides a more accurate representation of the intended decision tree logic while adhering to the specified input format and using meaningful thresholds.  Remember that this is still a simplified model, and a real-world application would require more sophisticated feature engineering and model training.
