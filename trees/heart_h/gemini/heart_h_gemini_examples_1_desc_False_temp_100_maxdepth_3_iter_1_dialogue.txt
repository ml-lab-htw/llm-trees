This function reflects the illustrative decision tree from the previous response, adapted to the specific feature names and encodings you provided. It uses the `chest_pain`, `oldpeak`, `ca`, and `age` features with the specified thresholds and logic.  Remember that this is a *demonstration* and a real-world model would require training on actual data.  The thresholds and feature choices would be learned from the data during the training process.
