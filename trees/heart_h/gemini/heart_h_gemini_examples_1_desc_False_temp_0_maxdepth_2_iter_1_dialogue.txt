**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added a threshold of 1.0 for `oldpeak` (ST Depression). This is a common clinical value used to assess risk. You might need to adjust this threshold based on your data and medical expertise.
* **Node Values List:** The `node_values` list now correctly reflects the path taken in the decision tree.  If the left branch (`chest_pain == 0`) is taken, the list includes the values for `chest_pain` and `oldpeak`. If the right branch is taken, it includes `chest_pain` and `ca`.
* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure is more aligned with the decision tree structure, making the code easier to understand.


This improved function provides both the prediction and a trace of the decision-making process, which can be valuable for understanding the model's behavior. Remember that the accuracy of this model depends on the chosen features and thresholds, which should be determined based on data analysis and medical domain knowledge. Using a real dataset and training a decision tree model with appropriate tools (like scikit-learn) will give you a more accurate and robust prediction system.
