**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with some medically-inspired values (e.g., thalach < 120, oldpeak > 2.0, age > 60). These are *examples* and should not be taken as medical advice. In a real application, you'd determine these thresholds from data analysis and consultation with medical experts.
* **Simplified Structure:** The hypothetical tree is still simplified for demonstration.  A real-world tree might be deeper and more complex.
* **Categorical Features:** The code now uses the numerical encoding provided for categorical features like chest pain type.
* **Risk Levels:** I've interpreted the output as risk levels (High/Medium/Low) rather than a binary prediction.  This could be adapted to a binary output (0 or 1) as needed.
* **Real-World Application:** Remember, this is a *demonstration*.  A real diagnostic tool would need to be developed using a much larger dataset, sophisticated machine learning techniques, and thorough validation in consultation with medical professionals.



To create a robust and accurate model, you'll need a substantial dataset of patient information and their corresponding heart disease diagnoses. Using this dataset and a library like scikit-learn, you can train a decision tree classifier and evaluate its performance rigorously.  The code provided here is a simplified example to illustrate the structure and logic of a decision tree-based prediction function.
