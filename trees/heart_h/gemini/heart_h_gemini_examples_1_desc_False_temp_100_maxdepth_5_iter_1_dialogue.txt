def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic Chest Pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0    # ST Depression > 2
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] > 0           # Number of Major Vessels > 0
    nodes[3] = X["age"] > 60         # Age > 60

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # High Risk
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # High Risk
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High Risk
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0.5 # Medium Risk (represented as 0.5, adjust as needed) # Medium Risk
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low Risk


    return prediction, nodes

```



This Python function represents the decision tree logic.  It takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features and returns the prediction (1 for high/medium risk, 0 for low risk) along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values at each decision node. I have adjusted the representation of risk level slightly to incorporate the medium risk by using 0.5. Note: the low/medium/high risk are still simplified.  This is a demonstration and a real model would require training and likely return probabilities.
