**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on general medical understanding.  For example, an `oldpeak` (ST depression) value greater than 2.0 is often considered significant.  Similarly, having more than 0 major vessels (`ca` > 0) colored by fluoroscopy is a strong indicator. The age threshold of 60 is also a common cutoff for increased risk. However, remember that optimal thresholds should be determined using a real dataset and machine learning techniques.
* **More Features:** The tree incorporates more features to make it slightly more realistic.  It now includes `thalach`, `chol` and `exang`.
* **Risk Levels:** While the original hypothetical tree just had "high," "medium," and "low" risk, this version simplifies it to a binary prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease). You could extend it to include multiple risk categories if desired.
* **Truth Value List:**  The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) of each decision node.  This is important for understanding the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.
* **Feature Dictionary:** The function uses the correct feature names from the provided list (e.g., `chest_pain`, `oldpeak`, `ca`).

**Important:** This is still a *demonstration* and not a medically valid decision tree.  It should **not** be used for real diagnosis. A real decision tree requires training on a dataset of patient data using a machine learning library.  This example merely shows how to structure such a function and use the specified features in a decision-making process.
