```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic chest pain
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5 # ST depression threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Higher risk with asymptomatic pain and significant ST depression
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Lower risk with asymptomatic pain and no significant ST depression
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Higher risk with other chest pain and significant ST depression
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Lower risk with other chest pain and no significant ST depression

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes] # Convert boolean nodes to integers
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold for `oldpeak`:**  I've set a threshold of 1.5mm for ST depression (`oldpeak`). This is a reasonable value based on medical literature, but it's crucial to understand that the optimal value would depend on the specific dataset and would be learned during the training of a decision tree model.
* **Asymptomatic Chest Pain:**  The tree prioritizes `chest_pain == 0` (Asymptomatic) as a significant risk factor.  This reflects the fact that asymptomatic ischemia can be a dangerous sign.
* **Integer Node Values:** The function now explicitly converts the boolean values in `nodes` to integers (0 or 1) as requested.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The `if/else` structure is more concise and directly reflects the decision tree logic.



**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 65, 
    'sex': 'male', 
    'chest_pain': 0, # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 150, 
    'chol': 250, 
    'fbs': 1, 
    'restecg': 0, 
    'thalach': 150, 
    'exang': 1, 
    'oldpeak': 2.0,  # Significant ST depression
    'slope': 1, 
    'ca': 1, 
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [1, 1] (Both conditions True)



patient_data2 = {
    'age': 65, 
    'sex': 'male', 
    'chest_pain': 1, # Atypical angina
    'trestbps': 150, 
    'chol': 250, 
    'fbs': 1, 
    'restecg': 0, 
    'thalach': 150, 
    'exang': 1, 
    'oldpeak': 0.5, # No significant ST depression
    'slope': 1, 
    'ca': 1, 
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [0, 0] (Both conditions False)

It is essential to remember that this is a very simplified model and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.  A real-world heart disease prediction system would require more sophisticated modeling and careful consideration of ethical implications.
