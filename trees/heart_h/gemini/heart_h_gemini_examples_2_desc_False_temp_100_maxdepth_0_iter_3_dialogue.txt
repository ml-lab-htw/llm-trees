**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable thresholds based on medical intuition. For a real-world application, these thresholds should be determined through data analysis and model training, potentially using techniques like ROC analysis or maximizing information gain.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The function uses the provided feature encodings directly.
* **Simplified Tree:** The decision tree is simplified for clarity.  A more complex tree could capture more nuances in the data, but this example demonstrates the required structure for the function.
* **Missing Values:** This code assumes no missing values.  In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle missing data appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling could be added (e.g., checking if required keys exist in `X`).


**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 63,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 145,
    'chol': 233,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 0,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 0,  # No exercise induced angina
    'oldpeak': 2.3,  # Significant ST depression
    'slope': 0,
    'ca': 0,       # No major vessels
    'thal': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True, False, False]
```



This improved version provides a more realistic and functional implementation, addressing key considerations for a practical heart disease prediction function. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values derived from proper model training on a real dataset.  And critically, consult medical professionals for interpretation and guidance.
