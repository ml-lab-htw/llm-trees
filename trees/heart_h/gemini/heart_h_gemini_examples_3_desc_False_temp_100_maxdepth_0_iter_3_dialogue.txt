**Explanation:**

* **Feature Selection and Thresholds:** I've selected features based on general medical intuition about heart disease risk:
    * `ca` (Number of vessels affected): More vessels with disease is a strong indicator.
    * `age`:  Older individuals are generally at higher risk.
    * `thalach` (Max heart rate): A lower maximum heart rate can indicate heart problems.
    * `chest_pain`: Typical angina is a more specific symptom of heart disease.
    * `oldpeak` (ST depression):  Larger ST depression during exercise is associated with higher risk. 
* **Tree Structure:** The tree structure reflects a logical flow of assessing risk:
    * Start with a strong indicator (`ca`).
    * If `ca` is not indicative, consider age and then other factors.
* **Truth Values:** The `nodes` list keeps track of which conditions were met, providing transparency into the decision process.

**Important:**

* **This is a simplified example!** Real-world heart disease prediction requires more features, data-driven threshold selection, and robust model validation.
* **Do not use this for medical diagnosis!** It is crucial to consult with healthcare professionals for accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.

To improve this model, you would:

1. **Use a labeled dataset:**  Train a decision tree algorithm on real patient data with known outcomes.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Explore more features and transformations that could improve predictive power.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different tree depths, splitting criteria, and pruning techniques to find the optimal model complexity. 
4. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the model's performance on unseen data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
