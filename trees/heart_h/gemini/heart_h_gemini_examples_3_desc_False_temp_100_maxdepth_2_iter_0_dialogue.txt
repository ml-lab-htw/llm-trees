**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I've chosen "ca" (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy), "thal" (Thalassemia), and "chest_pain" (Chest Pain Type) as potentially important features based on general medical knowledge. **This selection is for demonstration only and should not be considered medically accurate.** 
2. **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds (0.5, 2.5, 1.5) are chosen based on the feature value ranges and to create meaningful splits in the data. Again, this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would determine optimal thresholds through data analysis and potentially more complex decision boundaries.
3. **Tree Structure:**
   - The first split is on the number of major vessels.
   - For those with <= 0.5 vessels, the second split is on chest pain type.
   - For those with > 0.5 vessels, the second split is on thalassemia type.
4. **Prediction:** The `prediction` is made based on the path taken through the tree, which is determined by the feature values of the input sample.

**Remember:** This is a highly simplified example for illustration purposes only. Real-world heart disease prediction requires a more comprehensive approach involving medical experts, more sophisticated models, and rigorous validation.
