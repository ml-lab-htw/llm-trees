**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable thresholds based on medical knowledge where placeholders existed.  For example, `oldpeak > 2.0` (ST depression), `chol > 240` (cholesterol), and `age > 60`.
* **Handles Categorical Features:** The code now correctly handles categorical features like `chest_pain`, `sex`, `exang`, and `slope` by using equality or `in` checks.
* **Returns Node Truth Values:**  The function returns a list of 0s and 1s corresponding to the truth values of the conditions at each inner node. `None` is used where a node isn't evaluated due to branching.
* **Improved Readability:** The code is structured to follow the decision tree logic more closely, with comments explaining each branch.
* **Corrected Logic:** Ensured the logic accurately reflects the original decision tree's intent, especially in the non-asymptomatic chest pain branch.


**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {
    'age': 65, 'sex': 'male', 'chest_pain': 0, 'trestbps': 140, 'chol': 250, 
    'fbs': 1, 'restecg': 0, 'thalach': 150, 'exang': 1, 'oldpeak': 1.5, 
    'slope': 1, 'ca': 1, 'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [1, 0, 1, None, None, None, None] # Example - will vary with input
```


This improved function provides a more accurate and interpretable implementation of the decision tree for heart disease prediction. Remember that a real-world model would need to be trained on actual data. This example serves as a clear illustration of converting a decision tree description into a working Python function.
