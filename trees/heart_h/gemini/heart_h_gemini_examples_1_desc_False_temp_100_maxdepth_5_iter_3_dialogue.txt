**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`ca <= 0`:**  The number of major vessels (0-3) is a strong indicator.  If 0, the likelihood of heart disease decreases significantly.
* **`thal > 2` (equivalent to `thal == 3`):**  A reversible defect (thal=3)  is generally more concerning than a fixed defect or normal thalassemia.
* **`oldpeak > 1.5`:** A ST depression greater than 1.5 mm is often considered a significant indicator of ischemia.
* **`chest_pain == 0`:** Asymptomatic chest pain, while counterintuitive, can be a serious indicator in some cases.
* **`thalach <= 140`:** A lower maximum heart rate achieved during exercise can suggest reduced heart function.



**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This decision tree is constructed heuristically, *not* learned from data. Its accuracy is unknown and likely much lower than a model trained on real data.
* **Simplified Logic:** The logic here is vastly simplified compared to the complexity of heart disease diagnosis. It's intended for demonstration, not medical advice.
* **Feature Importance:** The order and thresholds chosen reflect a general understanding of risk factors, but a real model would determine feature importance from the data itself.



This improved version provides a more realistic (though still simplified) example and explains the reasoning behind the choices made. Remember that using this function for real-world predictions is strongly discouraged due to the lack of training.  It is solely for illustrative purposes.  A proper medical diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional.
