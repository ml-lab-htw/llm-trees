This function directly implements the hypothetical decision tree structure described previously, using the specified feature names and encoding. It returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decisions made at each inner node.  Remember that this tree is still hypothetical and not trained on actual data.  It is for illustrative purposes only.  Use a machine learning library with real data to build a practical model.
