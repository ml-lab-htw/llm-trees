**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:**  The provided feature descriptions are crucial. The function directly uses the encoded values (e.g., 0 for Asymptomatic chest pain).

2. **Thresholds:**  A threshold of 1.0 is used for `oldpeak` (ST depression). This is a reasonable starting point based on medical literature, where values above 1mm are often considered significant.  However, the optimal value would depend on the specific dataset and training. The threshold for `ca` is set to 0, as any blocked vessel suggests a strong possibility of heart disease.

3. **Clarity and Readability:** The code is structured to be more readable and directly map to the decision tree logic.

4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the boolean values for the conditions at each inner node. This allows for tracking the path taken through the tree.

**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 200,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 0.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output will be something like [True, False] showing the path taken.



patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 200,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 

```


This revised function provides a clear and functional implementation of the decision tree, along with valuable information about the decision path. Remember that for real-world application, training with a dataset is essential to determine the most accurate thresholds and feature importance.
