This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree structure from the previous response, using the specified feature names and encodings. Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* tree; a tree trained on real data would be different and likely more complex.  The thresholds (e.g., `oldpeak > 2.0`, `age > 60`) are examples and should be adjusted based on actual data analysis when you train a real model.
