I understand! Here's a Python function to represent a decision tree for heart disease prediction, along with examples for different depths. I've used common decision thresholds based on medical knowledge, but remember, this is just for illustration and **not a substitute for real medical advice.**

```python
def predict_heart_disease(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing patient features.
            Keys: 'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 
                  'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal'

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) 
            prediction (int): 1 for predicted heart disease, 0 otherwise.
            nodes (list): Truth values (1 or 0) for each inner node condition.
    """

    # Decision tree of depth 2
    nodes = 2 * [None] 

    # Node 1: Chest pain type (using a simplified angina vs. no angina split)
    nodes[0] = X['chest_pain'] == 3  # Typical angina

    # Node 2: Maximum heart rate achieved (threshold based on general risk)
    nodes[1] = X['thalach'] <= 140 

    # Prediction logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # Typical angina
        prediction = 1  # Higher risk 
    else: 
        if nodes[1]:  # Low max heart rate
            prediction = 1 # Higher risk
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Lower risk

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
patient_data = {
    'age': 65, 
    'sex': 'male', 
    'chest_pain': 3, 
    'trestbps': 140, 
    'chol': 250, 
    'fbs': 1, 
    'restecg': 2, 
    'thalach': 150, 
    'exang': 0, 
    'oldpeak': 1.0, 
    'slope': 2, 
    'ca': 1, 
    'thal': 2 
}

prediction, nodes = predict_heart_disease(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease Likely' if prediction == 1 else 'Heart Disease Less Likely'}")
print(f"Decision Path: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Function:** The `predict_heart_disease()` function takes a dictionary of patient features as input.
* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. 
* **Decision Tree Logic:**
    * The code implements the decision tree logic, using the feature values from the input dictionary (`X`) and comparing them to pre-defined thresholds.
* **Prediction:** The `prediction` variable is assigned a value (1 or 0) based on the path through the decision tree.
* **Output:** The function returns both the prediction and the `nodes` list.

**Adapting to Different Depths:**

* **Depth 1:** Remove the second node condition (`nodes[1]`) and the corresponding `if` statement within the `else` block. The prediction will depend only on the first node (chest pain type).
* **Depth 3+:** You can add more nodes and conditions to create a deeper tree. Each new level would require additional feature comparisons and logic to determine the prediction. 

**Important:** 

* **Feature Importance:** Determining the "most important" features requires training a machine learning model on real heart disease data and analyzing feature importance scores. This code uses common risk factors for illustration. 
* **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds used in the examples are for demonstration purposes. In a real-world setting, optimal thresholds should be determined through data analysis and model optimization. 

Let me know if you have a dataset, and I can help you build a more robust decision tree using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn!
