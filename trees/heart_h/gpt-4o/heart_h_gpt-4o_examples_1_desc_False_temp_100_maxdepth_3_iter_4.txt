Here is an example of a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 3 based on the Features you provided. The decision tree function returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca) is less than or equal to 1
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 1
    
    # Node 1: If ca <= 1, check if the maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) is less than or equal to 150 bpm
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
        
        # Node 2: If thalach <= 150, check if chest pain type is asymptomatic (chest_pain = 0)
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    # Node 1 (else): If ca > 1, check if thalassemia type is fixed defect (thal = 1)
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 1
        
        # Node 2: If thal = 1, check if exercise-induced angina (exang) is present (exang = 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["exang"] == 2
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0:** Checks whether the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 1.
- **Node 1 (left branch):** If `ca <= 1`, it checks whether the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 150 bpm.
- **Node 2 (left-left branch):** If `thalach <= 150`, it checks whether the chest pain type is asymptomatic (`chest_pain == 0`).
  - If true, it predicts heart disease (`1`).
  - Otherwise, it predicts no heart disease (`0`).
- **Node 1 (right branch):** If `ca > 1`, it checks whether the thalassemia type is a fixed defect (`thal == 1`).
- **Node 2 (right-right branch):** If `thal == 1`, it checks whether exercise-induced angina is present (`exang == 2`).
  - If true, it predicts heart disease (`1`).
  - Otherwise, it predicts no heart disease (`0`).
