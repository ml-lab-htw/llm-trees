### Explanation:
- **Node 0** evaluates whether the patient has "Asymptomatic" chest pain (`chest_pain == 0`).
- **Node 1** (for patients with "Asymptomatic" chest pain) checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is greater than 0.5.
- **Node 1** (for patients without "Asymptomatic" chest pain) checks if the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 140 bpm.
  
The function returns two things:
1. **`prediction`**: The predicted class (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease).
2. **`nodes`**: A list of boolean values representing whether each condition (inner node) was satisfied or not.
