Here's the implementation of a depth-1 decision tree classifier for predicting heart disease based on the feature `chest_pain`. The decision tree and accompanying Python function are formatted to match your specifications.

### Decision Tree:
The decision tree uses the `chest_pain` feature to split:
- If `chest_pain` == 0 (Asymptomatic): classify as "has heart disease" (1).
- Otherwise (other types of chest pain): classify as "does not have heart disease" (0).

Hereâ€™s the corresponding Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on the feature chest_pain.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - age
        - sex
        - chest_pain
        - trestbps
        - chol
        - fbs
        - restecg
        - thalach
        - exang
        - oldpeak
        - slope
        - ca
        - thal

    Returns:
    tuple: prediction (int), nodes (list of int)
        - prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        - nodes (list of int): Truth values (1 or 0) for each condition at the decision tree's inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check chest_pain == 0 (Asymptomatic)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input: patient data
patient_features = {
    "age": 63,
    "sex": "male",      # Not relevant for this tree
    "chest_pain": 0,    # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 145,
    "chol": 233,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 2
}

# Predict heart disease for the given input
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Has heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: [1] (Condition at node is True)
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input:**
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input. This dictionary includes all the specified features in the dataset.
2. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes` is a list that stores the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes.
   - In a depth-1 tree, there is exactly one inner node.
   - `nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0` checks whether the patient's `chest_pain` is classified as "Asymptomatic" (0 in the encoding). If true, `nodes[0]` is set to `1` (True); otherwise, it is set to `0` (False).
3. **Prediction:**
   - If the condition at the node (Node 0) is true (`nodes[0] == 1`), the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
   - Otherwise, the patient does not have heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
4. **Output:**
   - The function returns both the prediction (as an integer) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes.

### Modifying Decision Logic (Optional):
If additional thresholds/features are added in the future, the function can be easily extended or refined. For now, this implementation is specialized for a depth-1 decision tree with `chest_pain` as the most important feature.
