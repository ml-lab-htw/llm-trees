Given the exact keys of the features and their descriptions, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function. The function will take a dictionary of features as input and return a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Decision Tree Implementation:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 1  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'age': 45,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 120,
    'chol': 240,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 138,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.2,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inner Nodes (Conditions)**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`X["ca"]`) is ≤ 1.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the maximum heart rate achieved (`X["thalach"]`) is ≤ 140 bpm.
   
2. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` (Number of major vessels ≤ 1):
     - If `nodes[1]` (Maximum heart rate ≤ 140 bpm):
       - Predict "Heart Disease" (1)
     - Otherwise:
       - Predict "No Heart Disease" (0)
   - Otherwise:
     - Predict "Heart Disease" (1)

### Example Usage and Output:
For example input `X` with the patient's data, the function returns the prediction and the truth values for the inner nodes. The output will be a prediction of "Heart Disease" or "No Heart Disease" and a list of `nodes` showing which conditions were satisfied. 

This structure ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and the internal state of the tree is clear.
