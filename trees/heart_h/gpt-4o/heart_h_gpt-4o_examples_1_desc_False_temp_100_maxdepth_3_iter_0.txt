Here's the decision tree of depth 3 based on the Features and target variable you provided. The decision tree prioritizes the most important features intuitively related to heart disease, such as chest pain, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and the thalassemia condition.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check chest pain type (typical angina is a strong indicator of heart disease)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest pain is typical angina, likely to have heart disease
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Check the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] >= 1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check thalassemia condition
            nodes[2] = X["thal"] == 3  # Reversible defect more likely to indicate heart disease
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease if reversible defect
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease if no reversible defect
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease if no major vessels are colored
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0:** The first check is on `chest_pain`. If the patient has **typical angina** (value 3), it's a strong indicator of heart disease, so we predict `1` (heart disease). If not, we move to the next condition.
   
2. **Node 1:** If the patient doesn't have typical angina, we check the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`). If 1 or more vessels are colored, it's a sign of potential heart disease, so we continue to the next condition.
   
3. **Node 2:** If vessels are colored, we then check the thalassemia condition (`thal`). If the patient has a **reversible defect** (value 3), we predict heart disease (`1`). Otherwise, no heart disease (`0`).
   
4. **Default paths:** If the patient has no major vessels colored or fails other checks, we predict no heart disease (`0`).

This decision tree captures basic relationships between heart disease risk factors and the target variable in a maximum depth of 3.
