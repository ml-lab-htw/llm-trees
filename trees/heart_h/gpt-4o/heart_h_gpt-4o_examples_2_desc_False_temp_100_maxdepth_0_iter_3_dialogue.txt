Based on the decision tree example provided and the specific features and target variable details, hereâ€™s the Python function that will make predictions and return the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*6  # Adjust size based on the total number of conditions (nodes) in the decision tree

    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5 if nodes[0] else False
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1.5 if nodes[0] and nodes[1] else False
    nodes[3] = X["age"] > 55 if not nodes[0] else False
    nodes[4] = X["thalach"] <= 140 if not nodes[0] and not nodes[3] else False
    nodes[5] = X["exang"] == 2 if not nodes[0] and not nodes[3] and not nodes[4] else False

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 2,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation of the function:

1. **Nodes Initialization**: A list of `None` with a length based on the number of conditions.
2. **Nodes Assignment**: Each list entry checks if a specific condition is satisfied.
   - Node 0: Whether `chest_pain` is Typical angina (3).
   - Node 1: If `oldpeak` is less than or equal to 1.5, given chest_pain is Typical angina.
   - Node 2: If `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) is less than or equal to 1.5, given `oldpeak` condition is satisfied under typical angina.
   - Node 3: If `age` is greater than 55 when chest_pain is not typical angina.
   - Node 4: If `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) is less than or equal to 140 given age condition is not satisfied.
   - Node 5: If `exang` (exercise induced angina) is yes (2) given previous conditions are not satisfied.
   
3. **Prediction Logic**: Determines the prediction based on the truth values of the nodes.
4. **Return Statement**: Returns the prediction and a list of node evaluations.

This code can be tested with different feature dictionaries to see the prediction and the corresponding internal decision path taken.
