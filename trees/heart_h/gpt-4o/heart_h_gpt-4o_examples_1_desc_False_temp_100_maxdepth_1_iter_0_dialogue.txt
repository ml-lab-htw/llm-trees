Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the most important feature (`chest_pain`):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not (depth = 1).
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features. 
            Keys correspond to feature names, and values correspond to their respective values:
            'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg',
            'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal'

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        nodes (list): A list of boolean values where 1 indicates the condition of the corresponding inner node was satisfied,
                      and 0 means the condition was not satisfied.
    """
    nodes = [None]  # Track truth values of the nodes
    
    # Decision rule (based on the most important feature: 'chest_pain')
    # If chest_pain is "Asymptomatic" (encoded as 0), predict heart disease (1)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation
1. **Feature Importance**:
   - Based on prior domain knowledge and feature importance scores (hypothetically computed), `chest_pain` was selected as the top feature for classification. It has a strong correlation with heart disease.
   - We use `chest_pain == 0` (Asymptomatic chest pain) as the condition to make the decision.

2. **Truth Values `nodes`**:
   - The `nodes` list keeps track of whether the condition of the decision tree's inner node was satisfied. In this case, it contains a single boolean (`nodes[0]`) because the tree has a depth of 1.
   - `nodes[0] = True` indicates the condition `X["chest_pain"] == 0` was satisfied, while `False` means it was not.

3. **Encoding and Target Variable**:
   - The chest pain feature values are encoded as follows:
     ```
     3 = Typical angina
     0 = Asymptomatic
     2 = Non-anginal pain
     1 = Atypical angina
     ```
   - The target variable is encoded as:
     ```
     1 = Patient has heart disease
     0 = Patient does not have heart disease
     ```

### Testing the Function

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```python
# Example 1: Patient with asymptomatic chest pain
patient_1 = {
    'age': 54,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 256,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 144,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 1.8,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Patient has heart disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [1]

# Example 2: Patient with non-anginal chest pain
patient_2 = {
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 'female',
    'chest_pain': 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 240,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 3,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (Patient does not have heart disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [0]
```

### Output for the Examples
1. **Patient 1** (Asymptomatic chest pain):
   ```
   Prediction: 1
   Nodes: [1]
   ```

2. **Patient 2** (Non-anginal chest pain):
   ```
   Prediction: 0
   Nodes: [0]
   ```
