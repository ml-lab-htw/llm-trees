Here's the implementation of the decision tree as a Python function that adheres to the feature keys, target values, and formatting guidelines you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Maximum of 7 inner nodes for depth 4
    
    # Internal node evaluations based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # 'chest_pain' == Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 1  # 'exang' == no (Exercise Induced Angina)
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 140  # 'thalach' <= 140 bpm (Max Heart Rate Achieved)
    nodes[3] = X["slope"] == 2  # 'slope' == Flat (Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment)
    nodes[4] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0  # 'oldpeak' > 2.0 (ST Depression)
    nodes[5] = X["ca"] > 0  # 'ca' > 0 (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
    nodes[6] = X["slope"] != 2  # 'slope' != Flat (Handles Upsloping/Downsloping cases)

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # chest_pain == Typical angina
        if nodes[1]:  # exang == no
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # exang == yes
            if nodes[2]:  # thalach <= 140
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # thalach > 140
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:  # chest_pain != Typical angina
        if nodes[3]:  # slope == Flat
            if nodes[4]:  # oldpeak > 2.0
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # oldpeak <= 2.0
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # slope != Flat
            if nodes[5]:  # ca > 0
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # ca <= 0
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation of the Function**

#### Arguments:
- `X` is a dictionary where:
  - Keys are the exact feature names as listed: `["age", "sex", "chest_pain", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal"]`.
  - Values correspond to the feature values for a patient.

#### Returns:
1. **Prediction**:
   - `1`: Patient has heart disease (Yes).
   - `0`: Patient does not have heart disease (No).

2. **Nodes**:
   - A list of truth values (`1` for **True**, `0` for **False**) that indicates whether the corresponding condition of a decision tree node is satisfied.

#### Decision Tree Logic:
The decision tree mirrors the one provided earlier:
1. Starts with `chest_pain` (whether it's Typical angina).
2. Considers `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina) and `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate).
3. Branches further on `slope` (Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment), `oldpeak` (ST Depression), and `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy).

#### Example Usage:
```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    "age": 54,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 3,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 3
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 or 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Outputs truth values of each node in the decision tree
```

---

#### Sample Output
Using the example above:
- `Prediction`: The predicted target value (No Heart Disease = 0 or Yes Heart Disease = 1).
- `Nodes`: A list like `[False, False, False, False, False, False, True]` representing truth values at each tree node. Adjust this based on the patient data.
