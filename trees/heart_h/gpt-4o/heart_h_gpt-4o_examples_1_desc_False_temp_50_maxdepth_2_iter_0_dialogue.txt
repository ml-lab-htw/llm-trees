Here is the Python function for the decision tree you described, formatted to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on the provided features and encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not (1 = yes, 0 = no) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features with the following keys:
        'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg',
        'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal'

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes), where prediction is 0 or 1, and nodes is a list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the nodes list to store truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if chest pain type is asymptomatic (chest_pain == 0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if number of major vessels (ca) is <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if exercise-induced angina (exang) is yes (exang == 2)
        nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the input features with their exact keys and values as described.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 for `True`, 0 for `False`) of the conditions at the decision tree's inner nodes.
3. **Node 0**: The first split checks if the patient has **asymptomatic chest pain** (`chest_pain == 0`). This is the most important feature.
4. **Node 1** (Left Subtree): If `chest_pain == 0`, the next condition checks if the **number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy** (`ca`) is `<= 1`.
   - If `ca <= 1`, the patient is classified as **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).
   - Otherwise, the patient is classified as **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).
5. **Node 1** (Right Subtree): If `chest_pain != 0`, the next condition checks if the patient has **exercise-induced angina** (`exang == 2`).
   - If `exang == 2`, the patient is classified as **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).
   - Otherwise, the patient is classified as **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).
6. **Output**: The function returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, which shows the truth values of the inner conditions.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example patient data
patient = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 2,  # Yes
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 2,  # Number of major vessels
    "thal": 3
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Example Output:
For the example patient above:
```
Prediction: Heart Disease
Nodes: [1, 0]
```

This output means that the first condition (`chest_pain == 0`) was satisfied (`1`), but the second condition (`ca <= 1`) was not satisfied (`0`). Therefore, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
