Below is the Python function based on the decision tree example provided. This function uses predefined thresholds for each condition in the decision tree and returns a prediction and a list representing the truth values of each node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check Chest Pain Type (Asymptomatic vs Others)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy for Asymptomatic cases
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
        
        # Node 2: Check Age for Asymptomatic cases with <= 0.5 major vessels colored
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["age"] > 50
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            
    else:
        # Node 1 for Typical angina / Atypical angina / Non-anginal pain
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 140
        
        # Node 2: Check ST Depression for cases with higher heart rate
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.0
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example of usage:
example_patient = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 155,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0:** Checks if the `chest_pain` type is `Asymptomatic` (0) and sets the first node accordingly.
2. **Node 1 (Asymptomatic):** If the patient has asymptomatic chest pain, it checks the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca` <= 0.5).
3. **Node 2 (Asymptomatic with <= 0.5 major vessels):** For asymptomatic patients with <= 0.5 major vessels colored, it then checks the `age` (> 50).
4. **Node 1 (Non-Asymptomatic):** Otherwise, it checks if the `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved during exercise) is greater than 140.
5. **Node 2 (Non-Asymptomatic with higher heart rate):** For patients with higher heart rates, it checks if the `oldpeak` (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest) is <= 1.0.

The final prediction is arrived at by traversing these nodes based on the feature values provided in the input dictionary `X`.

### Example of Usage:
The example patient dictionary defines the features for a given patient, and it is passed to the `predict` function. The function returns the prediction (whether the patient has heart disease or not) and the list of truth values of the conditions. The `print` statements provide the output of the prediction and the nodes.
