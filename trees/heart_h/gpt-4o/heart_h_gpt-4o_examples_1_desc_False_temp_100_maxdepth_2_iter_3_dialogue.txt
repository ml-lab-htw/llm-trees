Below is the implementation of the decision tree as a Python function, designed as per your requirements. The decision tree has depth 2 and performs a classification to predict whether a patient has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`). It returns the prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Python Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0) 
    based on the input features `X`.

    Args:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 
         'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']

    Returns:
    prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
    nodes (list of int): Truth values of the inner nodes:
        1 if the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic (chest_pain == 0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If chest_pain is asymptomatic
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease is present
    else:
        # Node 2: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 140 (thalach)
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140

        if nodes[1]:  # If maximum heart rate is <= 140
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease is present
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Features**:
   - The function assumes the input `X` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the exact feature names you provided:
     ```
     ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 
      'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']
     ```

2. **Decision Tree Structure**:
   - **First Node (Root)**: `X["chest_pain"] == 0`
     - `chest_pain == 0` corresponds to the "Asymptomatic" type of chest pain, which is strongly indicative of heart disease. If this condition is satisfied (i.e., `nodes[0] = 1`), the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
   - **Second Node**: `X["thalach"] <= 140`
     - For patients who do not have "Asymptomatic" chest pain (`nodes[0] = 0`), the tree checks the **maximum heart rate achieved** (`thalach`). A heart rate of 140 bpm or lower indicates a higher likelihood of heart disease.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: The model's prediction for whether the patient has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` or `0`) for whether each inner node's condition is satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example patient input
X = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 1,  # Atypical angina
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 0,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 145,  # Maximum heart rate
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.0,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (heart disease):", prediction)  # Output: 0 (No heart disease)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)                # Output: [0, 0]
```

---

### Interpretation of Results:
1. `Prediction`: Whether the patient has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).
2. `Node Truth Values`:
   - For the example above:
     - First node (`chest_pain == 0`): `0` (False, because `chest_pain` is not "Asymptomatic").
     - Second node (`thalach <= 140`): `0` (False, because `thalach = 145 > 140`).

The model predicts `0` (No heart disease) for this example patient.
