### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition branches on the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`). If `ca <= 0.5`, it leads to the left branch; otherwise, it goes to the right.
   
2. **Node 1**: The second condition checks whether the patient has exercise-induced angina (`exang`). If `exang == 2` (yes), it leads to further branches; otherwise, it predicts no heart disease.

3. **Node 2**: The third condition checks the chest pain type (`chest_pain`). If the patient has `chest_pain == 3` (Typical angina), it continues branching.

4. **Node 3**: The fourth condition checks if the ST depression induced by exercise (`oldpeak`) is greater than 1.0. If true, it continues to the next node.

5. **Node 4**: The fifth condition checks the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`). If it is greater than 140 bpm, it influences the decision.

### Output:
- The function returns a **prediction** (either `1` for heart disease or `0` for no heart disease) based on the decision tree logic.
- It **also returns the list of truth values** (`nodes`), where each entry corresponds to whether the condition at each node is satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).
