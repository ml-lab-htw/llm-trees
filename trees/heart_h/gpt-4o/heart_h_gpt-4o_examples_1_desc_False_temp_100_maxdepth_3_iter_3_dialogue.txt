Here is a Python function for the induced decision tree based on the features of heart disease prediction. The function will predict whether a patient has heart disease (1 = yes) or not (0 = no) and also return the truth values of the inner nodes of the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a patient has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no) based on input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease
        - nodes (list): A list indicating the truth values of inner nodes in the decision tree (1 = condition is satisfied, 0 = condition is not satisfied).
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Class: No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Class: Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Class: Heart Disease
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 140  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 140
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 50  # Age <= 50
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Class: No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Class: Heart Disease
        else:
            nodes[2] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise Induced Angina = Yes
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Class: Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Class: No Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes

### Explanation:

#### How the decision tree is implemented:
- **Root Node (Node-0)**: The tree first checks if the `chest_pain` type is 0 (Asymptomatic).  
  - If **yes**, it moves to the next condition (`oldpeak` <= 1.5).  
  - If **no**, it moves to check `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved).  

- **Second Level (Node-1)**: Based on the root decision:  
  - If `chest_pain` = 0, it checks `oldpeak` (ST Depression Induced by Exercise).  
  - If `chest_pain` ≠ 0, it checks `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate).  

- **Third Level (Node-2)**:  
  - If `chest_pain` = 0 and `oldpeak` ≤ 1.5, it checks `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy).  
  - If `chest_pain` ≠ 0 and `thalach` > 140, it checks `age`.  
  - Otherwise, it checks `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example patient data dictionary
patient_data = {
    "age": 62,
    "sex": "male",  # Note: sex is ignored in this model
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 236,
    "fbs": 1,  # False
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 120,
    "exang": 2,  # Yes
    "oldpeak": 0.8,
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Run the prediction
prediction, node_truths = predict(patient_data)

# Output the results
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {node_truths}")
```

---

### Example Output:
For the example input:
```plaintext
Prediction: No Heart Disease
Node Truth Values: [1, 1, 1]
```

Here:
- Node 0 condition `chest_pain == 0` is true (`1`).
- Node 1 condition `oldpeak <= 1.5` is true (`1`).
- Node 2 condition `ca <= 1` is true (`1`).

This explanation and structure satisfy your requirements for a formatted tree in Python. You can adapt the thresholds and feature importance as needed depending on domain-specific insights or data analysis.
