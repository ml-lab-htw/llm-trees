Here is the Python implementation of your decision tree classifier formatted as a function. It takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as input, and it outputs a prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the conditions for the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] in [3, 1]  # Typical angina (3) or Atypical angina (1)
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0.5            # Number of major vessels <= 0.5
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.0        # ST Depression > 1.0
    
    # Make the prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease (Class 0)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease (Class 1)
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if X["thalach"] <= 140:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease (Class 1)
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease (Class 0)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease (Class 0)
    
    # Return the prediction and the truth values of inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### How It Works:
1. **Input Dictionary (`X`)**:
   - The input is a dictionary where the keys represent features (e.g., `chest_pain`, `ca`, `oldpeak`, etc.) and the values are their respective values for a given patient.

2. **Node Evaluations**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the patient has "Typical angina" (3) or "Atypical angina" (1) chest pain type, as these are strongly associated with the absence of heart disease.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 0.5. A higher number indicates higher likelihood of heart disease.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the ST Depression (`oldpeak`) exceeds 1.0. Higher ST Depression is a likely indicator of heart disease.

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If the patient has "Typical angina" or "Atypical angina" (`nodes[0]`) and meets node 1's condition, the prediction is **No Heart Disease (Class 0)**.
   - Otherwise, for patients with non-"Typical angina"-related chest pain:
     - If the ST Depression (`oldpeak`) is greater than 1.0 (`nodes[2]`) and their maximum heart rate (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 140, the prediction is **Heart Disease (Class 1)**.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns:
     - **`prediction`**: Binary classification, where `1` = Heart disease, `0` = No heart disease.
     - **`nodes`**: A list of truth values (`True`/`False` or `1`/`0`) corresponding to whether each inner decision path of the tree is satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,   # Typical angina
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 240,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 0.5,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 2
}

# Get the prediction and truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

# Output the result
print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Nodes Evaluated:", nodes)
```

### Example Output for the Above Case:
```
Prediction: No Heart Disease
Nodes Evaluated: [True, True, False]
```
