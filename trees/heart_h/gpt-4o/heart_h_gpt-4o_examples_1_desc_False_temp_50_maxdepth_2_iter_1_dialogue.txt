Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree for classifying whether a patient has heart disease or not. The function uses the features `chest_pain` and `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) as determined earlier, and it follows the structure you requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features with the following keys:
        - 'age'
        - 'sex'
        - 'chest_pain'
        - 'trestbps'
        - 'chol'
        - 'fbs'
        - 'restecg'
        - 'thalach'
        - 'exang'
        - 'oldpeak'
        - 'slope'
        - 'ca'
        - 'thal'

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied)
          for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If chest pain type is Asymptomatic
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # If chest pain type is not Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # If number of major vessels <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # If number of major vessels > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inputs**: The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the patient's features. The keys in the dictionary match the exact spelling provided in the feature list.
2. **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if `chest_pain` is `0` (Asymptomatic).
   - `nodes[1]` checks if `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is `<= 0`.
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If the chest pain type is `Asymptomatic` (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
   - Otherwise, the decision depends on the number of major vessels (`ca`):
     - If `ca <= 0` (`nodes[1]` is `True`), the patient is classified as not having heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
     - If `ca > 0` (`nodes[1]` is `False`), the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
4. **Outputs**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The classification result (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,  # Number of major vessels
    "thal": 3
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, False]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds and conditions are based on domain knowledge and the provided feature descriptions.
- This decision tree is simple and interpretable, with a maximum depth of 2.
