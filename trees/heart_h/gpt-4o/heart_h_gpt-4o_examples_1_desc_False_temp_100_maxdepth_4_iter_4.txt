Below is a Python function that represents a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 4 based on the Features you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Create a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] > 0  # Condition based on the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 3  # Thalassemia (Reversible defect)
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0  # ST Depression induced by exercise
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] < 150  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the conditions in the decision tree:
1. **ca > 0**: If the patient has more than 0 major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, it tends to indicate a higher risk of heart disease.
2. **thal == 3**: A reversible defect in thalassemia is often associated with a higher risk of heart disease.
3. **oldpeak > 2.0**: A high ST depression induced by exercise may indicate a greater chance of heart disease.
4. **thalach < 150**: A lower maximum heart rate achieved during exercise can also be a sign of heart disease.

The function returns both the predicted class (`prediction`) and a list (`nodes`) that stores the truth values of the four inner nodes used for the decision-making process.
