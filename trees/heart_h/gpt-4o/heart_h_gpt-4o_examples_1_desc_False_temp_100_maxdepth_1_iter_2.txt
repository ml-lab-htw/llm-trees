Given the Features and target variable, we need to design a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1. This means that the decision tree will have at most one inner node (a single condition) that splits the data, and then the prediction will depend on the outcome of this condition.

The target variable is whether the patient has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no). Based on the features provided, we will select the most relevant feature to split on. In heart disease prediction, features like "ca" (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) and "thal" (thalassemia) are commonly considered important, so we'll use one of those features for the split.

For this example, let's choose the feature `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) as the most important feature. We will set a threshold of `ca <= 1` to split the data, as fewer major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is often associated with a healthier heart.

Here is the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Inner node: Check if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca) is less than or equal to 1
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 1

    # If the condition is satisfied (ca <= 1), predict no heart disease (0)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    # Otherwise, predict heart disease (1)
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- We used the feature `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) as the most important feature.
- The condition checks if `ca <= 1`. If this condition is true, the model predicts that the patient does **not** have heart disease (0).
- If the condition is false (i.e., `ca > 1`), the model predicts that the patient **has** heart disease (1).
- The function also returns a list `nodes` which contains a single boolean value representing whether the condition `ca <= 1` was satisfied or not.

#### Example usage:
```python
patient_data = {
    "age": 45,
    "sex": 1,
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 170,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 0,  # Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    "thal": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Output:
```plaintext
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True]
```

In this case, the model predicts that the patient does not have heart disease (`prediction = 0`) because the condition `ca <= 1` is true (`nodes = [True]`).
