Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on the provided features. The decision tree uses two important features: `chest_pain` and `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy), with threshold values that are meaningful based on medical knowledge.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list to store the boolean values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Check the chest pain type
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest pain type is Asymptomatic, predict heart disease (yes = 1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # If chest pain type is not Asymptomatic, check number of major vessels
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 0  # Check if number of major vessels is greater than 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the patient has more than 0 major vessels colored, predict heart disease
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If the patient has 0 major vessels colored, predict no heart disease
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The root node checks if the patient has **Asymptomatic chest pain** (`chest_pain == 0`).
  - If `Asymptomatic`, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
- **Node 1**: If the patient does not have Asymptomatic chest pain, the decision is based on the **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy** (`ca`).
  - If `ca > 0`, the patient is classified as having heart disease.
  - If `ca == 0`, the patient is classified as not having heart disease.

This decision tree is simple yet effective, using key medical features to make predictions.
