Here's a decision tree of depth 5 based on the Features you provided, formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list of the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Chest pain type
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic chest pain
    
    # Node 2: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 1  # More than 1 major vessel colored
    
    # Node 3: Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise)
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0  # Oldpeak greater than 2.0
    
    # Node 4: Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] < 150  # Max heart rate less than 150 bpm
    
    # Node 5: Thalassemia
    nodes[4] = X["thal"] == 3  # Reversible defect in thalassemia
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Asymptomatic chest pain
        if nodes[1]:  # More than 1 major vessel colored
            if nodes[2]:  # Oldpeak > 2.0
                if nodes[3]:  # Max heart rate < 150
                    if nodes[4]:  # Reversible defect in thalassemia
                        prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Oldpeak > 2.0
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # More than 1 major vessel colored
            if nodes[3]:  # Max heart rate < 150
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # Reversible defect in thalassemia
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease present
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1 (`nodes[0]`)**: Checks if the patient has asymptomatic chest pain (`chest_pain == 0`).
2. **Node 2 (`nodes[1]`)**: Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is greater than 1 (`ca > 1`), which indicates a higher risk of heart disease.
3. **Node 3 (`nodes[2]`)**: Evaluates if the ST depression induced by exercise (`oldpeak`) is greater than 2.0. A higher `oldpeak` can indicate more severe heart problems.
4. **Node 4 (`nodes[3]`)**: Checks if the maximum heart rate achieved during exercise (`thalach`) is less than 150 bpm. Lower heart rate recovery can be a sign of cardiovascular problems.
5. **Node 5 (`nodes[4]`)**: Determines if the patient has a reversible defect in thalassemia (`thal == 3`), which can be associated with heart disease.

### Usage:
- To use this function, pass a dictionary `X` with the feature values. 
- The function will return a prediction (1 if heart disease is present, 0 if absent) and a list of truth values for the conditions of each inner node.

For example, to predict for a sample patient:

```python
X = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": 1,  # Male
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic 
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 130,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 2.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 2,
    "thal": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This example would output whether the patient likely has heart disease (`prediction`) and the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
