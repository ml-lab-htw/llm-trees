### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The decision tree starts by checking the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`). If it's 0 or less, we tend to lean towards a higher risk of heart disease.
  
- **Node 1**: The tree then checks the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`). A value greater than 140 indicates a lower risk of heart disease for this branch.

- **Node 2**: The tree checks if the patient experiences exercise-induced angina (`exang`). If the angina is absent (0), it slightly lowers the risk of heart disease.

- **Node 3**: The tree then checks if the ST depression (`oldpeak`) is less than or equal to 1. Higher values indicate more severe exercise-induced ischemia, which relates to heart disease risk.

- **Node 4**: Finally, it checks for a reversible defect in thalassemia (`thal`). If a reversible defect is present, the risk of heart disease is higher.
