Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts whether a patient has heart disease (`1` for yes, `0` for no) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features with the following keys:
        - 'age'
        - 'sex'
        - 'chest_pain'
        - 'trestbps'
        - 'chol'
        - 'fbs'
        - 'restecg'
        - 'thalach'
        - 'exang'
        - 'oldpeak'
        - 'slope'
        - 'ca'
        - 'thal'
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if chest pain type is asymptomatic (0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check if maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) is <= 140 bpm
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If chest pain type is asymptomatic
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease (yes)
    else:  # If chest pain type is not asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # If maximum heart rate achieved is <= 140 bpm
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease (yes)
        else:  # If maximum heart rate achieved is > 140 bpm
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease (no)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the `chest_pain` type is `0` (asymptomatic). This is a strong indicator of heart disease.
2. **Node 1**: If the patient does not have asymptomatic chest pain, the second condition checks if the `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) is less than or equal to `140`. A lower maximum heart rate is often associated with heart disease.
3. **Prediction**:
   - If the patient has asymptomatic chest pain (`chest_pain == 0`), they are classified as having heart disease (`1`).
   - Otherwise, the decision depends on the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`):
     - If `thalach <= 140`, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`1`).
     - If `thalach > 140`, the patient is classified as not having heart disease (`0`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
patient_data = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 120,  # Maximum heart rate achieved
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Example Output:
For the above example:
- `nodes[0]` is `True` because `chest_pain == 0` (asymptomatic).
- `nodes[1]` is `True` because `thalach <= 140`.
- The prediction is `1` (the patient has heart disease).
