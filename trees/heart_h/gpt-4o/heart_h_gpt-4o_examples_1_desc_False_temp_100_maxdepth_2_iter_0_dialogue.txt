Here is the Python function representing the decision tree classifier based on the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to keep track of the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check chest pain type (Asymptomatic or not)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # 0 = Asymptomatic
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If chest pain is asymptomatic
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Check the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 0  # 0 = no major vessels affected by fluoroscopy
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If there are major vessels affected
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): We check if the **chest pain type** is "Asymptomatic" (`chest_pain == 0`). If true, the function predicts **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`), as asymptomatic patients are less likely to have heart disease.
   
2. If the patient is not asymptomatic, we proceed to **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`), where we check the **number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy** (`ca > 0`). If there are any major vessels affected (`ca > 0`), the function predicts **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).

3. If no major vessels are affected (`ca == 0`), the function predicts **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input for a patient:
patient_data = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 1,  # Atypical angina
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 0,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 175,
    "exang": 1,  # No exercise-induced angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 1,  # One major vessel colored by fluoroscopy
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

# Output
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Prediction: 1 (Heart disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Nodes: [False, True]
```
