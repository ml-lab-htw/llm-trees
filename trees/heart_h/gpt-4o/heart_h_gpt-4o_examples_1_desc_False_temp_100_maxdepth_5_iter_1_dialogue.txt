Below is the Python function implementation for a decision tree classifier based on the provided feature names, descriptions, and target variable encoding. I've selected meaningful thresholds and conditions for the splits, guided by relevance to heart disease indicators.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease (target: yes = 1, no = 0)
    based on the input features and returns decision node truth values.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing patient features with the exact keys:
                  ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs',
                  'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
               - prediction (int): 1 if the patient is predicted to have heart disease, 0 otherwise.
               - nodes (list): List of truth values (1 or 0) for decision nodes.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of decision nodes.

    # Node 1: Thalassemia check
    # If thal == 1 (Fixed defect), a strong indication of heart disease.
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # If True: Thalassemia indicates "Fixed defect".
        # Node 2: Check Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
        # Angina induced by exercise (exang == 2) is a strong indicator of heart disease.
        nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease.
        else:
            # Node 3: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
            # If ca <= 1, higher likelihood of heart disease.
            nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease.
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease.
    else:  # If False: Non-Fixed defect or other Thalassemia case.
        # Node 4: Chest Pain Type (chest_pain)
        # Typical angina (chest_pain == 3) often suggests no heart disease.
        nodes[3] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease.
        else:
            # Node 5: ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak)
            # If oldpeak > 1.5, it suggests greater heart stress and potential disease.
            nodes[4] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
            if nodes[4]:
                # Further check the Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope).
                # A Downsloping slope (slope == 1) strongly indicates heart disease.
                if X["slope"] == 1:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease.
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease.
            else:
                # Also check Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach).
                # If thalach <= 150 bpm, lower heart performance may indicate heart disease.
                if X["thalach"] <= 150:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease.
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease.

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input:
patient_data = {
    "age": 45,
    "sex": "male",  # This isn't used in our tree
    "chest_pain": 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    "trestbps": 130,  # Resting blood pressure
    "chol": 230,  # Cholesterol level
    "fbs": 1,  # Fasting blood sugar
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal ECG
    "thalach": 140,  # Maximum heart rate achieved
    "exang": 2,  # Yes, angina induced by exercise
    "oldpeak": 2.3,  # ST depression value
    "slope": 1,  # Downsloping
    "ca": 1,  # 1 major vessel
    "thal": 1  # Fixed defect
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

# Print outputs
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 means heart disease, 0 means no heart disease.
print("Decision Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Truth values of the decision nodes.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Decision Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `thal == 1` (Fixed defect) → Strong indicator of heart disease.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `exang == 2` (Exercise-induced angina → yes).
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `ca <= 1` (Number of major vessels ≤ 1 → higher likelihood of disease).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if `chest_pain == 3` (Typical angina → no disease).
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if `oldpeak > 1.5` (ST depression during exercise).

2. **Target**:
   - Returns a prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease).
   - Also returns a list of the truth values for the inner nodes. These can help in interpretability and debugging.
