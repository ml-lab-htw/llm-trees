Here's the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not, formatted as a Python function. The function also returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 1
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] > 150
    nodes[3] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise Induced Angina: yes
    nodes[4] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
    nodes[5] = X["chest_pain"] in [3, 2, 1]  # Typical angina, Atypical angina, Non-anginal pain

    if nodes[0]:  # Chest Pain Type: Asymptomatic
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 1
            if nodes[2]:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 150
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 150
                if nodes[3]:  # Exercise Induced Angina: yes
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:  # Exercise Induced Angina: no
                    if nodes[4]:  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.5
                        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                    else:  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest <= 1.5
                        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 1
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Example feature dictionary
X = {
    'age': 59,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 221,
    'fbs': 1,  # false
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal
    'thalach': 120,
    'exang': 2,  # yes
    'oldpeak': 1.6,
    'slope': 2,  # Flat
    'ca': 2,
    'thal': 3  # Reversible defect
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node values:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if `chest_pain` is `0` (Asymptomatic). If `True`, predicts `1` (Heart Disease).
2. **Node 1**: If `chest_pain` is not `Asymptomatic`, checks if `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is less than or equal to `1`.
3. **Node 2**: If `ca` is `<= 1`, checks if `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is greater than `150`.
4. **Node 3**: If `thalach` is `<= 150`, checks if `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina) is `2` (yes).
5. **Node 4**: If `exang` is not `yes`, checks if `oldpeak` (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) is greater than `1.5`.
6. **Node 5**: Simplified node condition to verify `chest_pain` types ([3, 2, 1] for specific chest pain types).
   
By running the code, we will get a diagnosis for heart disease and the specific conditions that were met or not met in the decision tree.
