Let's create the Python function based on the decision tree discussed earlier for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. The function will return a prediction along with a list indicating the truth values of the decision nodes.

### Decision Tree:
1. **Chest Pain Type**:
   - Typical angina (value 3) is less likely associated with heart disease compared to other types.
   
2. **Age**:
   - Age greater than 58.5 years is more indicative of heart disease.
   
3. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**:
   - A maximum heart rate achieved of 135.5 bpm or lower may indicate heart disease.

4. **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)**:
   - Higher values (closer to 2 or 3) can indicate more severe heart issues.

5. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)**:
   - Flat (value 2) or downsloping (value 1) is more indicative of heart disease.

### Python Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 58.5
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 135.5
    nodes[4] = X["slope"] == 3

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
patient_features = {
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 1,
    'chest_pain': 1,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 120,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected output: 1 (if patient has heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # [False, False, False, True, False]
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: Checks if the patient has Typical angina (chest pain type 3).
- **nodes[1]**: Checks if the number of major vessels colored by Fluoroscopy is 0 or 1.
- **nodes[2]**: Checks if the patient is 58.5 years old or younger.
- **nodes[3]**: Checks if the maximum heart rate achieved is 135.5 bpm or lower.
- **nodes[4]**: Checks if the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is Upsloping (value 3).

Given these inputs, the tree navigates through the nodes and makes a prediction. The prediction variable will be 0 or 1 indicating if the patient has a heart disease or not respectively. The nodes array will hold boolean values indicating if the condition of the corresponding node was met.
