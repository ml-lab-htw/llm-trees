    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0

    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 1

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest pain is Asymptomatic, predict heart disease (1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If chest pain is not Asymptomatic and ca > 1, predict heart disease (1)

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the patient has **Asymptomatic chest pain** (chest_pain == 0), which is a strong indicator of heart disease.
- **Node 1** is evaluated only if the patient does not have Asymptomatic chest pain. It checks if the **number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)** is greater than 1. A larger number of occluded vessels is associated with a higher risk of heart disease.
- The final prediction is either 1 (heart disease) or 0 (no heart disease), and the list `nodes` holds the truth values of the inner conditions.
