Here’s how the defined decision tree for predicting heart disease would look in Python. The function makes a prediction based on the provided input dictionary `X` (features) and also returns the truth values of the inner nodes (as a list):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of inner node conditions (truth values)
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Decision tree conditions
    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] == 2  # "thal" = Normal (encoded as 2)
    # Node 1
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0  # "ca" = Number of major vessels <= 0
    # Node 2
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] <= 2.0  # "oldpeak" = ST depression <= 2.0
    # Node 3
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] > 140  # "thalach" = Maximum heart rate > 140
    # Node 4
    nodes[4] = X["ca"] > 0  # "ca" = Number of major vessels > 0

    # Decision tree traversal
    if nodes[0]:  # "thal" == Normal
        prediction = 0  # Class: No heart disease (0)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # "ca" <= 0
            prediction = 1  # Class: Heart disease (1)
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # "oldpeak" <= 2.0
                if nodes[3]:  # "thalach" > 140
                    prediction = 0  # Class: No heart disease (0)
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Class: Heart disease (1)
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Class: No heart disease (0)

    # Return the predicted class and the list of truth values for each node
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Let’s test the function on an example case:

```python
# Input features for a single patient
X_test = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": 1,  # male
    "chest_pain": 3,  # Typical angina
    "trestbps": 130,  # Resting blood pressure
    "chol": 250,  # Cholesterol
    "fbs": 1,  # Fasting Blood Sugar False (1)
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 150,  # Maximum heart rate
    "exang": 1,  # No exercise-induced angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,  # ST depression
    "slope": 3,  # Upsloping
    "ca": 1,  # Number of major vessels
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print(f"Truth values of inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Example Explanation:
1. The patient has "thal" = 3 (Reversible defect), so `nodes[0] = False`. This determines that the decision moves past the first node.
2. The "ca" (number of major vessels) is 1, so `nodes[1] = False` — the next branch is taken.
3. The "oldpeak" = 1.5, which satisfies `oldpeak <= 2.0`, so `nodes[2] = True`.
4. The "thalach" = 150 satisfies `thalach > 140`, so `nodes[3] = True`.
5. At this point, the decision results in class 1 (Heart disease), as per the tree traversal logic.

### Output for the Example:
```
Prediction: 1
Truth values of inner nodes: [False, False, True, True, False]
``` 

This Python function captures the decision tree logic with meaningful thresholds and outputs the necessary information as specified.
