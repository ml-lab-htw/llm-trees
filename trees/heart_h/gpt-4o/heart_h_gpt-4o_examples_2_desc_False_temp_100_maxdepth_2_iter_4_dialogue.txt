Let's write a Python function that represents the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction based on the given features. The function will return a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 120  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["chest_pain"] == 3:  # Typical angina
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_sample = {
    'age': 51,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 1,  # Atypical angina
    'trestbps': 130,  # Resting Blood Pressure
    'chol': 234,  # Serum Cholesterol
    'fbs': 1,  # Fasting Blood Sugar
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal Resting ECG
    'thalach': 150,  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    'exang': 1,  # No Exercise Induced Angina
    'oldpeak': 1.2,  # ST Depression
    'slope': 3,  # Upsloping
    'ca': 1,  # Number of Major Vessels Colored
    'thal': 3  # Reversible defect
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0:** Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`X["ca"] <= 0.5`) is satisfied.
- **Node 1:** Checks if the maximum heart rate achieved (`X["thalach"] <= 120`) is satisfied.

### Conditions:
- **If Node 0 is true (`X["ca"] <= 0.5`):**
  - Next check is the type of chest pain:
    - If **typical angina** (`X["chest_pain"] == 3`): predict **no heart disease (0)**
    - Else: predict **heart disease (1)**
  
- **If Node 0 is false (`X["ca"] > 0.5`):**
  - Next check is the maximum heart rate:
    - If heart rate **less than or equal to 120** (`X["thalach"] <= 120`): predict **heart disease (1)**
    - Else: predict **no heart disease (0)**

This function is designed to closely mirror the structured decision-making process explained in the previous simple tree diagram while using the accurate feature names and potential thresholds as inputs.
