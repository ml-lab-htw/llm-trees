Here's a Python function that implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on the specified features. The function will return the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

For the decision tree, we'll use:
1. `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
2. `chest_pain` (Chest Pain Type)

Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # No major vessels colored implies no heart disease
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Chest Pain Type
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical angina
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'age': 63,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,  # Typical angina
    'trestbps': 145,
    'chol': 233,
    'fbs': 1,  # false
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,  # no
    'oldpeak': 2.3,
    'slope': 2,  # Flat
    'ca': 2,  # 2 Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    'thal': 3  # Reversible defect
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart disease' if prediction else 'No heart disease'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Evaluates if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is 0 or not. If `ca` is 0 (implying no major vessels are colored), the patient is predicted to have no heart disease.
2. **Node 1**: If there is at least one vessel colored (`ca` > 0), it then evaluates the type of chest pain (`chest_pain`). If the patient has `chest_pain` type 3 (Typical angina), it suggests a higher risk of heart disease.

### Output:
For the example provided:
- **Prediction**: Outputs `Heart disease` because there are 2 vessels colored (`ca` > 0) and `chest_pain` is `Typical angina`.
- **Nodes**: Outputs the list `[False, True]`, where:
  - `nodes[0]` is `False` because `ca` is not <= 0.
  - `nodes[1]` is `True` because `chest_pain` equals 3 (Typical angina).
