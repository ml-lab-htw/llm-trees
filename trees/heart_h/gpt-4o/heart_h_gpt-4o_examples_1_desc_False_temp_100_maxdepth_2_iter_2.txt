Let's build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, based on the features provided.

The Features include factors related to heart disease. We will choose 2-3 important features for heart disease prediction and build a binary decision tree with a depth of 2.

Given that heart disease is often correlated with:
1. **thal** (Thalassemia, a blood disorder that affects the heart),
2. **ca** (Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, an indicator of blood flow blockages, which is highly relevant to heart disease),
3. **oldpeak** (ST Depression, a measure that indicates heart strain during exercise),

I will use these features to construct a decision tree for predicting heart disease.

Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list with None, we will store True (1) or False (0) for each node condition
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First condition (inner node 1): Check if Thalassemia (thal) is normal (2)
    nodes[0] = X["thal"] == 2
    
    # Second condition (inner node 2): Check if the number of major vessels (ca) is 0
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] == 0
    
    # Decision logic based on tree structure
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease if thal is normal and no major vessels blocked
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease if thal is normal but there are major vessels blocked
    else:
        if X["oldpeak"] > 1.0:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease if thal is abnormal and there is significant ST depression
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease if thal is abnormal but ST depression is low

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **First node (thal)**: If the patient has a normal thalassemia result (`thal == 2`), this is generally a good sign, so we're likely to predict no heart disease unless other conditions indicate otherwise.
   
2. **Second node (ca)**: If the patient has no major vessels blocked (`ca == 0`), this is a strong indicator that the patient does not have heart disease. Otherwise, we predict heart disease.

3. **Fallback node (oldpeak)**: If the thalassemia is abnormal but the ST depression (`oldpeak`) is mild (`<= 1.0`), we predict no heart disease. If it's high (`> 1.0`), we predict heart disease.

This Python function returns both the prediction (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease) and the truth values of the conditions in the internal nodes.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input:
X = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 1,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 0,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3
}

# Call the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

Output will be:
```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [False, False]
```

In this case, the patient is predicted to have heart disease (`prediction = 1`), and the conditions for the internal nodes (`nodes`) are both `False`.
