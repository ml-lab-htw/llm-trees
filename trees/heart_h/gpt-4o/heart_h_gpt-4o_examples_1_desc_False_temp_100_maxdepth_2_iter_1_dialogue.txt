Here is the Python function based on the decision tree we discussed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings that you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic (0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check if Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca) is <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest pain is asymptomatic, predict no heart disease (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If chest pain is not asymptomatic, check number of major vessels
        if nodes[1]:
            # If number of major vessels is 0, predict no heart disease
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If number of major vessels is more than 0, predict heart disease
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first decision is based on whether the patient has **Asymptomatic Chest Pain** (`chest_pain == 0`). If true, the function predicts `0` (no heart disease).
- **Node 1**: If the patient has any other type of chest pain, the next decision is based on the **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy** (`ca`). If `ca <= 0`, the prediction is `0` (no heart disease), otherwise `1` (heart disease).
- The function returns the final prediction as well as a list `nodes` containing the truth values of the conditions at each decision node.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'age': 55, 
    'sex': 'male', 
    'chest_pain': 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 160,
    'exang': 1, 
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 1,  # One major vessel colored
    'thal': 2,
    'target': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output:
```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [False, False]
```

In this example, the first condition (`chest_pain == 0`) is `False` (since chest pain is Non-anginal), and the second condition (`ca <= 0`) is also `False` (since `ca` is 1). Hence, the final prediction is `1` (heart disease).
