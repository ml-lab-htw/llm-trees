Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function for predicting whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0). The function returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define each node condition in the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic (most indicative of heart disease)
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 0         # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0
    nodes[2] = X["thal"] in [1, 3]  # Thalassemia is Fixed defect or Reversible defect
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.0   # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.0
    nodes[4] = X["thalach"] > 140   # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 140 bpm

    # Traverse the decision tree based on the truth values of the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Chest pain type is Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0
            if nodes[2]:  # Thalassemia is Fixed defect or Reversible defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:  # Thalassemia is Normal
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # Chest pain type is not Asymptomatic
        if nodes[3]:  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.0
            if X["slope"] == 3:  # Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment is Upsloping
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:  # Slope is Flat or Downsloping
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # ST Depression <= 1.0
            if nodes[4]:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 140 bpm
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 140 bpm
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are feature names (matching exact spelling) and the values are the feature values for a single patient.
2. **Nodes List**: `nodes` is a list of boolean values representing whether the condition of each decision tree node was satisfied (1 for `True`, 0 for `False`).
3. **Conditions**: Logical expressions are used to evaluate whether a specific condition for each decision point is satisfied. These conditions correspond to thresholds determined from the decision tree.
4. **Tree Traversal**: Using nested `if-else` conditions, the function mimics the traversal of the decision tree to determine the patient's outcome.

### Example Usage
Suppose we have the following patient data:
```python
patient = {
    "age": 54,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,  # False
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 120,
    "exang": 2,  # Yes
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}
```

The function can be called as:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(patient)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, False, True, True, False]
```

In this case:
- `nodes[0]` is `True` because the patient has asymptomatic chest pain.
- `nodes[1]` is `False` because the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is 1 (not <= 0).
- `nodes[2]` is `True` because the patient has a "Reversible defect" thalassemia.
- `nodes[3]` is `True` because ST depression is 1.5 (greater than 1.0).
- `nodes[4]` is `False` because the maximum heart rate achieved is 120 (not > 140).

Therefore, the prediction is `1` (Heart disease).
