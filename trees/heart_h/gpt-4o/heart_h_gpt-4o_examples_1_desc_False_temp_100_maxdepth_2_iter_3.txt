Based on the Features and target variable, I will create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, as requested. The decision tree will have between 2 and 3 inner nodes, depending on the most important features.

Here is the decision tree based on the Features:

### Decision Tree:
- **Node 1**: Check if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 0.
  - **Node 2 (Left Child)**: If `ca` <= 0, then check if the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is greater than 150.
    - If `thalach` > 150, predict **No heart disease** (`target = 0`).
    - If `thalach` <= 150, predict **Heart disease** (`target = 1`).
  - **Node 3 (Right Child)**: If `ca` > 0, predict **Heart disease** (`target = 1`).

### Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Check if maximum heart rate achieved is greater than 150
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 150
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1** checks if `ca` (the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) is less than or equal to 0. This is an important feature because the number of vessels affected by heart disease can indicate the severity of the condition.
2. **Node 2** (left child of Node 1) checks if `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) is greater than 150. A higher heart rate during exercise can indicate better heart health, hence a lower likelihood of heart disease.
3. If `ca` is greater than 0 (right child of Node 1), the decision tree directly predicts heart disease (`target = 1`), as more major vessels affected by heart disease strongly indicate the presence of the condition.

The function returns both the prediction (whether the patient has heart disease or not) and a list representing whether the condition of each inner node was satisfied (1 for True, 0 for False).
