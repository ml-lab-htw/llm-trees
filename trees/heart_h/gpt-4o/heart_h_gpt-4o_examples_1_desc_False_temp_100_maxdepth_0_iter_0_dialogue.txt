    else:

        nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise Induced Angina corresponds to 2 (yes)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If exercise-induced angina is present, predict Heart Disease
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if the patient's chest pain is **Asymptomatic** (encoded as `0`). If yes, we predict **No Heart Disease** (0).
   
2. If the chest pain is not asymptomatic, we move to **Node 1**, which checks if the patient experiences **Exercise Induced Angina** (encoded as `2`). If yes, we predict **Heart Disease** (1).

3. If the patient does not experience exercise-induced angina (encoded as `1` for "no"), we predict **No Heart Disease** (0).

The function returns two things:
1. **prediction**: A binary value indicating whether the patient has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).
2. **nodes**: A list of truth values representing whether the conditions at each node were satisfied or not.
