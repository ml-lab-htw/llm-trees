Here is the decision tree function for classifying whether a patient has a heart disease or not (`1 = yes`, `0 = no`). The function is based on the decision tree I outlined earlier, formatted as requested. It returns both the prediction and a list of truth values indicating which conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]  # 8 inner nodes in our decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[2] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise Induced Angina (yes)
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] > 140.5
    nodes[4] = X["thal"] == 3  # Reversible defect
    nodes[5] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.5
    nodes[6] = X["slope"] == 1  # Downsloping

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Inputs (X):**
  - A dictionary where the keys are the exact feature names provided (`'age'`, `'sex'`, `'chest_pain'`, `'trestbps'`, `'chol'`, `'fbs'`, `'restecg'`, `'thalach'`, `'exang'`, `'oldpeak'`, `'slope'`, `'ca'`, `'thal'`).
  - The values are expected to match the range and encoding described for each feature.

- **Nodes:**
  - Represents the conditions for the inner nodes of the tree. Each entry in the `nodes` list is `True` (1) if the condition is satisfied and `False` (0) otherwise.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - Based on the decision tree structure, nested `if-else` statements are used to traverse the tree and assign the appropriate prediction (`1` = Heart Disease, `0` = No Heart Disease).

- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: A single integer (`1` or `0`) representing the classifier's prediction.
  - `nodes`: A list of `1` (True) or `0` (False) values indicating whether the corresponding decision conditions were satisfied.

### Example Usage:
Input a dictionary representing patient features to get the prediction and truth values for the nodes:

```python
# Example patient data
patient = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": 1,  # male
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 240,
    "fbs": 1,  # false
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 150,  # Maximum Heart Rate
    "exang": 2,  # Exercise Induced Angina (yes)
    "oldpeak": 3.0,  # ST depression
    "slope": 1,  # Downsloping
    "ca": 0,  # No major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    "thal": 3,  # Reversible defect
}

prediction, node_truths = predict(patient)
print("Prediction (Heart Disease):", prediction)  # Output: 1
print("Node truth values:", node_truths)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, False, True, True, True, None]
```

This function adheres to the requirements and translates the decision tree into an implementation that captures both the prediction and the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes.
