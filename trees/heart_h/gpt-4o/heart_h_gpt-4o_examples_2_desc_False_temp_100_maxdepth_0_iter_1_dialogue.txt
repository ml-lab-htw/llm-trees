Let's build a Python function to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on the provided decision tree. The function will return the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 9

    nodes[0] = X['chest_pain'] == 3  # Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X['age'] <= 55  # Age <= 55 (within Typical angina branch)
    nodes[2] = X['chol'] <= 240  # Serum Cholesterol <= 240 (within Age <= 55 branch)
    nodes[3] = X['chest_pain'] == 1  # Chest Pain Type == Atypical angina
    nodes[4] = X['ca'] <= 0  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0 (within Atypical angina branch)
    nodes[5] = X['chest_pain'] == 2  # Chest Pain Type == Non-anginal pain
    nodes[6] = X['thalach'] <= 150  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 150 (within Non-anginal pain branch)
    nodes[7] = X['chest_pain'] == 0  # Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
    nodes[8] = X['ca'] <= 1  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 1 (within Asymptomatic branch)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
        if nodes[1]:  # Age <= 55
            if nodes[2]:  # Serum Cholesterol <= 240
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
            else:  # Serum Cholesterol > 240
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # Age > 55
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    elif nodes[3]:  # Chest Pain Type == Atypical angina
        if nodes[4]:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    elif nodes[5]:  # Chest Pain Type == Non-anginal pain
        if nodes[6]:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 150
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 150
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    elif nodes[7]:  # Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
        if nodes[8]:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 1
            if X['thal'] == 1:  # Thalassemia == Fixed defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            elif X['thal'] == 3:  # Thalassemia == Reversible defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            elif X['thal'] == 2:  # Thalassemia == Normal
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 1
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Default case (highly unlikely since chest_pain should have been covered in conditions)

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
patient_data = {
    'age': 58,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 3,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'heart disease' if prediction else 'no heart disease'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. The function first initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes.
2. Each node checks the corresponding condition from the decision tree and stores the result (True/False).
3. The conditions from the tree are compared step by step to make the prediction (`0` for no heart disease, `1` for heart disease).
4. Finally, the function returns the prediction and the `nodes` list.

Replace the placeholder values in the example usage with actual patient data to get the prediction and inner node truth values accordingly. The function is designed to follow the structure and logic derived from the initial decision tree you provided.
