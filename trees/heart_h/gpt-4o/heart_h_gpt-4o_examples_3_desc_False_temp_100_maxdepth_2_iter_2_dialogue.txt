Based on the requirements and example format provided, hereâ€™s a Python function that builds a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. We'll use the features `chest_pain` and `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) with specific thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical angina
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

    # Decision based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # If chest_pain is Typical angina
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # If Maximum Heart Rate Achieved is <= 150
            prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_patient = {
    'age': 54,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,  # false
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal
    'thalach': 155,
    'exang': 1,  # no
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 3,  # Upsloping
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2  # Normal
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this function:
- `nodes[0]` checks if the `chest_pain` is of type 3 (Typical angina), which is a strong indicator of heart disease.
- `nodes[1]` checks if the `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is less than or equal to 150 bpm, another important indicator for heart disease.

The function then makes a prediction:
- If `chest_pain` is Typical angina, it predicts the presence of heart disease.
- If `chest_pain` is not Typical angina but `thalach` is less than or equal to 150 bpm, it still predicts the presence of heart disease.
- Otherwise, it predicts no heart disease.

The function also returns a list (`nodes`) with the truth values of the inner nodes to indicate whether each condition was satisfied or not.
