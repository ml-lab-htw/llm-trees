            prediction = 1  # Predict heart disease (yes = 1)

### Explanation:
1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`)**: The first decision node checks the **chest_pain** feature. If the chest pain type is **Asymptomatic** (encoded as 0), it strongly suggests an underlying heart condition, so the prediction is **heart disease (1)**.
   
2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`)**: If the chest pain is not asymptomatic, the next decision is based on the **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (`ca`)**. If **`ca` is greater than 0**, meaning at least one major vessel is blocked, this is a strong indicator of heart disease, so the prediction is **heart disease (1)**. If no vessels are blocked (i.e., `ca == 0`), we predict **no heart disease (0)**.

This function returns a prediction of whether the patient has heart disease (`1` for yes, `0` for no) and a list of boolean values representing whether the conditions of the internal decision nodes were satisfied.
