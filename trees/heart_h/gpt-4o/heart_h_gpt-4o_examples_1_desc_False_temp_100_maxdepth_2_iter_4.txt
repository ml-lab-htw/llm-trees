Here is a potential decision tree based on the Features you've provided, with a maximum depth of 2:

### Decision Tree Structure:
- **First Node**: The first split is based on the feature `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) because higher heart rates are often associated with better cardiovascular fitness, which may suggest a lower risk of heart disease.
- **Second Node**: If `thalach` is below a certain threshold, the second node further splits based on `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy), which is a significant indicator of heart disease.
- **Leaf Nodes**: The tree makes predictions based on these two features.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # First split on 'thalach' (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] >= 150
    
    # Second split on 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on whether the `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is greater than or equal to 150.
   - If **True** (i.e., the patient achieved a high maximum heart rate), we move to node 1.
   - If **False** (i.e., the patient has a lower maximum heart rate), the model predicts heart disease (`prediction = 1`).

2. **Node 1**: If `thalach` is greater than or equal to 150, the second split is on `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy).
   - If `ca` is less than or equal to 1, the model predicts no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
   - Otherwise, it predicts heart disease (`prediction = 1`).

### Example Input:

```python
X = {
    "age": 45,
    "sex": 1,  # Male
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 160,  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    "thal": 2
}
```

### Example Output:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# prediction = 0 (No heart disease)
# nodes = [True, True]
``` 

In this example, since `thalach` is greater than or equal to 150 and `ca` is less than or equal to 1, the model predicts that the patient **does not have heart disease**.
