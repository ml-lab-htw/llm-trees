Given the feature descriptions and the target variable encoding, let's create the decision tree function that adheres to the specified requirements. 

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example of how to use the predict function
# Let's say the patient's features are as follows:
patient_features = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 3
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- We start by creating a list `nodes` with `None` values to keep track of the truth values for each internal node in the decision tree.
- The first node checks if `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is â‰¤ 140. If this condition is true, the model predicts "Heart Disease" (1).
- If the first condition is false (`thalach` > 140), the model then checks the chest pain type:
  - If `chest_pain` is `0` (Asymptomatic), it predicts "Heart Disease" (1).
  - If `chest_pain` is not `0`, it predicts "No Heart Disease" (0).

This design ensures the tree's depth does not exceed 2, and decision making remains simple and interpretable. The function returns both the prediction and the truth values of the internal nodes used to make the prediction. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a dictionary of patient features and prints the prediction and node values.
