Based on the given features and the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, here's a Python function that predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not (`target: 1 = Yes, 0 = No`) based on the feature `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy):

---

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on the decision tree of depth 1.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features. 
                  Expected keys: ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 
                                  'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        nodes (list): A list representing the truth value of the inner nodes.
    """
    # Evaluate the condition of the root node
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5  # Root node condition: is the number of major vessels <= 0?

    # Make the prediction based on the root node condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Yes, heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation

1. **Feature Used (`ca`):**
   - `"ca" (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)` has values in {0, 1, 2, 3}. The chosen threshold is `0.5` because this allows the condition to categorize patients with `ca = 0` into the "No heart disease" class, while `ca > 0` (1, 2, or 3) indicates "Heart Disease."

2. **Nodes List:**
   - A list `nodes` is used to track the truth value (`True`/`False`, represented as `1`/`0`) of each inner node.
   - Since the decision tree has only one depth, there is a single root node, and thus `nodes` is a single-element list.

3. **Thresholds:**
   - The threshold `0.5` was chosen to ensure that the decision logic works correctly for integer values of `ca`.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Patient with no major vessels
patient_features = {
    'age': 45,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 240,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,  # Number of major vessels
    'thal': 2
}
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)  # Prediction: 0 (No heart disease)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)

# Example 2: Patient with multiple major vessels
patient_features = {
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 'female',
    'chest_pain': 0,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 300,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 1,
    'thalach': 120,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 2.3,
    'slope': 1,
    'ca': 2,  # Number of major vessels
    'thal': 1
}
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)  # Prediction: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output for the Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   ```plaintext
   Prediction: 0
   Nodes: [1]
   ```
   (Condition is true: `ca <= 0.5`, so the patient is predicted to have no heart disease.)

2. **Example 2:**
   ```plaintext
   Prediction: 1
   Nodes: [0]
   ```
   (Condition is false: `ca > 0.5`, so the patient is predicted to have heart disease.)
