Based on your requirements and the given feature descriptions, here is a Python function that implements a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. The prediction is based on the given features, and the inner nodes' conditions are returned as a list of boolean values.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Condition for the root node
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Condition for the first split
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3  # Typical angina
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        # Condition for the second split
        nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 2  # Normal thalassemia
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 233,
    "fbs": 1,  # false 
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,  # no
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 0, 
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

print(predict(patient_data))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Decision Tree Construction**:
   - **Root Node (Node 0)**: The root node checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 0.5.
   - **First Split (Node 1)**: If the root node condition is satisfied, the next node checks if the chest pain type (`chest_pain`) is "Typical angina" (encoded as 3).
   - **Second Split (Node 1)**: If the root node condition is not satisfied, the next node checks if thalassemia (`thal`) is "Normal" (encoded as 2).

2. **Inner Nodes**:
   - These are stored in the `nodes` list as boolean values indicating whether the condition for that node is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`).

3. **Example Usage**:
   - The `predict` function can be called with a dictionary containing the patient's features to get the prediction and the list of inner node conditions.

This function simplifies the decision-making process based on a maximum depth of 2 and provides a clear structure for understanding the basis of classification.
