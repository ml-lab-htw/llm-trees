Here is the decision tree implementation in Python as per your request, formatted to match the example format and depth of 3. The function predicts whether a patient has heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no) given the features provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has a heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no) based on input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary with keys matching feature names:
        'age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 
        'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal'
    
    Returns:
    (int, list): A tuple containing:
        - The prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease)
        - A list of truth values (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for each inner node
    
    """
    # Initialize the truth values list for each inner node
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Chest Pain Type = Asymptomatic
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 140 bpm
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0   # ST Depression Induced by Exercise > 2.0
    
    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if X["ca"] > 0:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0 - Chest Pain Type**:
   - If `chest_pain` is 0 (Asymptomatic): There’s a higher likelihood of heart disease, so we check further using `ca` (Number of Major Vessels).
   - If not Asymptomatic, we proceed to examine the heart rate achieved.

2. **Node 1 - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**:
   - If `thalach` is ≤ 140 bpm (low heart rate): It could indicate heart disease, so we continue with more checks.
   - If it’s > 140 bpm, then it’s likely no heart disease.

3. **Node 2 - ST Depression Induced by Exercise**:
   - For low heart rates (`thalach` ≤ 140), if `oldpeak` > 2.0: This is indicative of significant heart stress, predicting heart disease.
   - If `oldpeak` ≤ 2.0, it’s likely no heart disease.

4. **Number of Major Vessels** (`ca`):
   - If `chest_pain` is Asymptomatic but there are no major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca` ≤ 0), then it’s predicted to be no heart disease. Otherwise, heart disease is predicted.

### How to Use the Function:

You can call this function with a dictionary containing the patient’s features. For example:

```python
# Example input
patient = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,            # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 0,
    'restecg': 3,
    'thalach': 120,             # Maximum heart rate achieved
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.5,             # ST Depression
    'slope': 1,
    'ca': 2,                    # Number of major vessels
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient)
print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Prediction: Heart Disease
Node Truth Values: [1, 1, 1]
``` 

This shows that the patient is predicted to have heart disease, and each of the conditions at the nodes was satisfied.
