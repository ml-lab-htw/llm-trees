Let's implement the decision tree as a Python function that will return a single prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, using the given feature keys and target encoding.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision point based on Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If ca <= 0.5
        # Second decision point based on Thalassemia (thal)
        nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 2  # Thalassemia: Normal
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If thal == Normal
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # If thal is Fixed defect or Reversible defect
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # If ca > 0.5
        # Second decision point based on Chest Pain Type (chest_pain)
        nodes[1] = (X["chest_pain"] == 3) or (X["chest_pain"] == 1)  # Typical angina or Atypical angina
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If chest_pain is Typical angina or Atypical angina
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # If chest_pain is Non-anginal pain or Asymptomatic
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

The function `predict` will:
1. Accept a dictionary `X` containing feature values for a given patient.
2. Evaluate the decision tree conditions step by step.
3. Populate the `nodes` list with truth values of the inner nodes.
4. Make a prediction based on the evaluated conditions.
5. Return the prediction and the list of node evaluations.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python
# Example input
input_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 2,  # Non-anginal pain
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,  # false
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal
    'thalach': 160,
    'exang': 1,  # no
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,  # Flat
    'ca': 1,  # 1 major vessel
    'thal': 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(input_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

This example demonstrates how to use the function to make predictions for whether a patient has heart disease based on their features. The function returns both the prediction and the evaluations of the inner nodes.
