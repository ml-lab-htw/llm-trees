Here is a decision tree function with a maximum depth of 3, based on the Features and target you provided. The tree uses a few key features such as `thal`, `ca`, and `oldpeak`, as these are commonly seen as important indicators of heart disease.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check the Thalassemia status (thal)
        nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 3  # Reversible defect
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease likely
        else:
            # Node 2: Check the ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)
            nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease likely
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Check the Thalassemia status (thal)
        nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 1  # Fixed defect
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease likely
        else:
            # Node 2: Check the Slope of peak exercise ST segment (slope)
            nodes[2] = X["slope"] == 1  # Downsloping
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease likely
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: First, we check the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`). If the value is less than or equal to 0.5, we proceed to check `thal`.
- **Node 1**: If `ca` is low, we then check the `thal` status. If it's a `3` (reversible defect), we predict heart disease (`1`). If not, we move to check `oldpeak`.
- **Node 2**: If `oldpeak` (ST depression) is greater than 1.5, we predict heart disease (`1`). Otherwise, no heart disease (`0`).
- In case `ca` is greater than 0.5, we check `thal` again, and if it's a `1` (fixed defect), we predict heart disease. If not, we move to check `slope`. If `slope` is downsloping (`1`), we predict heart disease, otherwise no heart disease.

This tree has three inner nodes, and the maximum depth is 3.
