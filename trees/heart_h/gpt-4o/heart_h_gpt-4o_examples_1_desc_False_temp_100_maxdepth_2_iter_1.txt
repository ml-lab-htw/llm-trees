Given the Features and the Target variable (whether the patient has heart disease or not), I will create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. The decision tree will focus on two features that are commonly important in predicting heart disease: `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) and `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy). These features are commonly used in heart disease risk assessment.

### Decision Tree:
- **Node 1:** Check if `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved) is less than or equal to 140. Lower heart rates during exercise can indicate a problem with the heart's ability to pump blood.
- **Node 2:** Check if `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) is less than or equal to 1. A higher number of major vessels with fluoroscopy coloration can indicate blockages, which are associated with heart disease.

Hereâ€™s the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 1: Based on 'thalach' (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    
    # Node 2: Based on 'ca' (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
    nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 1
    
    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If thalach <= 140
        if nodes[1]:  # If ca <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Patient likely has heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Patient likely does not have heart disease
    else:  # If thalach > 140
        prediction = 0  # Patient likely does not have heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The first condition checks if the patient's maximum heart rate (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 140. If true, it moves to the next condition.
- The second condition checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 1. If both conditions are true, the patient is predicted to have heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
- If the first condition is false (i.e., `thalach > 140`), the patient is predicted not to have heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
- If `thalach <= 140` but `ca > 1`, the model predicts the patient does not have heart disease.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 135,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.0,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function will output the prediction (whether the patient has heart disease or not) and a list of the truth values for the inner nodes based on the input features.
