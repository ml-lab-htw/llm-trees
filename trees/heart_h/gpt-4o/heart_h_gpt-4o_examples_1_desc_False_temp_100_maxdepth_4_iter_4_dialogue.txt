Below is the Python implementation of the decision tree classifier based on the example decision tree provided earlier. The function takes a dictionary `X` (where the keys are the exact feature names provided) and returns a prediction (`0` or `1`) and a list of truth values (`0` or `1`) for the inner nodes.

### Python Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Create a list of 7 (one for each decision node in the tree)
    
    # Evaluate the conditions at each decision node
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 1  # 1 = no
    nodes[2] = X["thalach"] > 140
    nodes[3] = X["exang"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[4] = X["thal"] == 1  # 1 = Fixed defect
    nodes[5] = X["slope"] == 2  # 2 = Flat
    nodes[6] = X["oldpeak"] > 2.0

    # Traverse the decision tree based on truth values
    if nodes[0]:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 0.5
        if nodes[1]:  # Exercise Induced Angina == no
            if nodes[2]:  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 140
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        elif nodes[3]:  # Exercise Induced Angina == yes
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = None  # Should not reach here logically, fallback
    else:  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0.5
        if nodes[4]:  # Thalassemia == Fixed defect
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:  # Thalassemia in (Normal, Reversible defect)
            if nodes[5]:  # Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment == Flat
                if nodes[6]:  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 2.0
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:  # Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment != Flat
                if X["age"] > 55:  # Age > 55
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:  # Age <= 55
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,  # Typical angina
    "trestbps": 120,  # Resting BP mmHg
    "chol": 240,  # Serum Cholesterol
    "fbs": 1,  # Fasting Blood Sugar false
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal ECG
    "thalach": 150,  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    "exang": 1,  # No Exercise Induced Angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 0,  # 0 Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Get prediction and truth values of the nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print("Truth values of nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Truth values of the inner nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Prediction Logic**: The tree is implemented as a series of nested conditions based on the feature thresholds and splits constructed earlier. Each condition corresponds to a node in the decision tree, and the leaf nodes yield the final classification.
- **Inner Node Truth Values**: The list `nodes` contains `1` if the corresponding condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise. For example, `nodes[0]` checks if `ca <= 0.5`.
- **Thresholds**: These were selected based on the logical splits described in the earlier tree. For example:
  - `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is an important feature, with `<= 0.5` being a meaningful threshold.
  - `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) with a threshold of `140` splits patients into groups typical for heart disease classification.
  - `oldpeak`, `thal`, and `slope` were similarly chosen based on domain knowledge. 

This implementation strictly follows the feature names, target values, and logic of the decision tree with a max depth of 4. The structure ensures readability and interpretability while offering predictions and node evaluation details.
