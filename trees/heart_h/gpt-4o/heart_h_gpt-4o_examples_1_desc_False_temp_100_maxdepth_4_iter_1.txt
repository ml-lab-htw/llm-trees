Here is the decision tree based on the Features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision Tree Structure
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] > 1  # First split on number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 3  # Second split on thalassemia (Reversible defect)
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5  # Third split on ST depression induced by exercise
    nodes[3] = X["age"] > 55  # Fourth split on age (higher risk for older patients)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Higher risk of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Still high risk of heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Lower risk of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Lower risk of heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Lower risk of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Lower risk of heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Higher risk of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Higher risk of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Higher risk of heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Higher risk of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Lower risk of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Lower risk of heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: The first split is based on the "ca" feature (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy), where a value greater than 1 suggests a higher risk of heart disease.
- **nodes[1]**: The second condition checks if "thal" (thalassemia) equals 3, indicating a reversible defect, which implies a higher risk of heart disease.
- **nodes[2]**: The third decision is based on "oldpeak" (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest). A value greater than 1.5 suggests a higher risk of heart disease.
- **nodes[3]**: The fourth split is based on "age", with older patients (age > 55) being more likely to have heart disease.

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 4 nodes and attempts to make predictions based on factors typically linked to heart disease.

### Usage Example:
```python
# Example input (patient data)
patient_data = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": 1,
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 2.0,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 2,
    "thal": 3
}

# Get prediction and truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Decision Path: {nodes}")
```

This function will return a prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease) and a list of truth values for each inner node.
