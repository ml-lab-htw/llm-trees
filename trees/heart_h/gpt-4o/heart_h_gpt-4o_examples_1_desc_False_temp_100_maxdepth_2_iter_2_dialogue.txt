### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: Checks if the chest pain type is asymptomatic (`chest_pain == 0`). If true, the decision proceeds to Node 1, which evaluates the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca > 0`).
- **Node 1 (if asymptomatic)**: If the number of vessels colored is greater than 0, the prediction is heart disease (`prediction = 1`), otherwise, no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
- **Node 1 (if not asymptomatic)**: If the chest pain type is not asymptomatic, the decision checks if the thalassemia value indicates a reversible defect (`thal == 3`). If true, the prediction is heart disease (`prediction = 1`), otherwise, no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).

This function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
