Here's a decision tree of maximum depth 3 based on the Features and the Target variable `target` (heart disease prediction):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First decision node based on maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
    nodes[0] = X["thalach"] <= 150
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second decision node based on chest pain type (chest_pain)
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Third decision node based on age
            nodes[2] = X["age"] > 60
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low likelihood of heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease based on non-typical chest pain
    else:
        # Second decision node if thalach > 150, based on exercise induced angina (exang)
        nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 2
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease due to angina
        else:
            # Third decision node based on serum cholesterol (chol)
            nodes[2] = X["chol"] > 240
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # High likelihood of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low likelihood of heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`). If the maximum heart rate is less than or equal to 150, there is a higher chance of heart disease, so we move to the next decision.
   
2. **Node 1** (if `thalach <= 150`): The second decision is based on the chest pain type (`chest_pain`). If the chest pain type is `3` (Typical angina), we then check the age in the next node.

3. **Node 2** (if `thalach <= 150` and `chest_pain == 3`): If the person is older than 60, the likelihood of heart disease is high (`prediction = 1`), otherwise it's lower (`prediction = 0`).

4. **Node 1** (if `thalach > 150`): If the maximum heart rate achieved is more than 150, the next decision is based on whether the patient has exercise-induced angina (`exang`). If yes (`exang == 2`), the likelihood of heart disease is high.

5. **Node 2** (if `thalach > 150` and `exang != 2`): If there is no exercise-induced angina, we check the cholesterol levels (`chol`). If cholesterol is higher than 240, there is a higher likelihood of heart disease (`prediction = 1`), otherwise, the likelihood is lower (`prediction = 0`).

### How to Use:
- Pass a dictionary `X` containing the Features like age, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.
- The function `predict(X)` will return:
  - The predicted outcome (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease).
  - A list of truth values representing the conditions of the inner nodes (1 if satisfied, 0 otherwise).
