Based on the Features and target variable (`target: patient has heart disease or not`), I will construct a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1. Given that we are limited to a single inner node, I will select an important feature that is commonly associated with heart disease to make the decision. One such feature is `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy), as it can be a strong indicator of heart disease.

Here is the resulting decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] > 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision node is based on the `ca` feature (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy). If the number of major vessels is greater than 0, the patient is predicted to have heart disease (`prediction = 1`). Otherwise, the prediction is that the patient does not have heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
- The `nodes` list contains one boolean value that represents whether the condition of the inner node is satisfied (`True` if `ca > 0`, otherwise `False`).

### Example:
Let's run a sample prediction:

```python
X = {
    "age": 54,
    "sex": 1,  # Male
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 240,
    "fbs": 1,  # Fasting Blood Sugar is false
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,  # No exercise-induced angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 2,  # 2 major vessels colored
    "thal": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

#### Output:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True]
```

In this case, since `ca = 2`, the condition `ca > 0` is satisfied, so the model predicts that the patient has heart disease (`prediction = 1`), and the inner node condition is `True`.
