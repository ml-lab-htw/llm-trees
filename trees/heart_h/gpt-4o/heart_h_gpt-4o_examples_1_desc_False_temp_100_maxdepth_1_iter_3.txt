Based on the Features and the target variable (whether a patient has heart disease or not), I will create a decision tree with a depth of 1. The decision tree will have one inner node, and I will choose one important feature for splitting.

Since this is a small tree with a depth of 1, I'll select a key feature related to heart disease. A common indicator of heart disease is the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`). Higher values of `ca` generally indicate a higher likelihood of heart disease.

Here's the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Inner node: check the number of major vessels ('ca')
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # If 'ca' is 0 or less, predict heart disease (yes = 1)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Otherwise, predict no heart disease (no = 0)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Feature used**: `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)
  - The decision rule is based on whether the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 0.
  - If `ca` is 0 or fewer (meaning none or very few major vessels are colored), the model predicts the presence of heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
  - If `ca` is greater than 0, the model predicts no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).
  
The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. It returns a prediction (either 0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
