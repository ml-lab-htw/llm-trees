Let's create a Python function to implement the decision tree classifier for heart disease prediction based on the provided feature set. We'll use the conditions from the decision tree and include appropriate checks to build the truth value list (`nodes`).

Here are the exact keys of the features:
- `age`
- `sex`
- `chest_pain`
- `trestbps`
- `chol`
- `fbs`
- `restecg`
- `thalach`
- `exang`
- `oldpeak`
- `slope`
- `ca`
- `thal`

And the target variable:
- `target` (1 = yes, 0 = no)

### Decision Tree and Python Function

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['ca'] <= 0  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X['chest_pain'] <= 1  # Chest Pain Type (Asymptomatic/Atypical angina = 0, 1)
    nodes[2] = X['exang'] <= 1  # Exercise Induced Angina (1 = no)
    nodes[3] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.75  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0
            else:
                prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    'age': 52,
    'sex': 'female',
    'chest_pain': 1,
    'trestbps': 120,
    'chol': 168,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 147,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.4,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 3,
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation
1. **Nodes**: A list of truth values representing the conditions in the decision tree.
   - `nodes[0]` checks if `ca` (the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) is less than or equal to 0.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if `chest_pain` type is less than or equal to 1 (either asymptomatic or atypical angina).
   - `nodes[2]` checks if `exang` (exercise-induced angina) is less than or equal to 1 (meaning no).
   - `nodes[3]` checks if `oldpeak` (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest) is less than or equal to 1.75.

2. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is true, it then checks `nodes[1]`.
   - If `nodes[1]` is true, it next checks `nodes[2]` to decide.
   - If `nodes[2]` is true, the prediction is 0 (no heart disease), else the prediction is 1 (heart disease).
   - If `nodes[1]` is false, the prediction is 1 (heart disease).
   - If `nodes[0]` is false, it then checks `nodes[3]` to decide.
   - If `nodes[3]` is true, the prediction is 0 (no heart disease), else the prediction is 1 (heart disease).

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values, processes the conditions in the decision tree, and returns the predicted class along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
