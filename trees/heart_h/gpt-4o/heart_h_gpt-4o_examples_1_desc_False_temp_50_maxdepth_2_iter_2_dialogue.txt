Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the decision tree.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the tree.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    # Node 0: Check the chest pain type (0 = Asymptomatic)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If chest pain type is Asymptomatic
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the maximum heart rate achieved is <= 140 bpm
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If max heart rate achieved is <= 140
            prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
        else:  # If max heart rate achieved is > 140
            prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inner Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the chest pain type is **Asymptomatic** (`chest_pain == 0`). This is the first condition in the decision tree.
   - `nodes[1]`: If the first condition is not satisfied, it checks whether the **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved** is less than or equal to 140 (`thalach <= 140`).

2. **Predictions**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `False`, the decision moves to the second condition (`nodes[1]`):
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
     - Otherwise, the patient is classified as not having heart disease (`prediction = 0`).

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns the predicted class (`prediction`) and the list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 120,
    "chol": 240,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 3,
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart Disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, None]
```

### Example Walkthrough:
- Given `X["chest_pain"] == 0`, `nodes[0]` is `True`, so the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
- Since the first condition is satisfied, the second condition (`nodes[1]`) is not evaluated (`None`).

This function is modular and easy to extend if you decide to add more depth or features to the decision tree later.
