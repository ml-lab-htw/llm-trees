Based on the Features and the target variable (`target`), we will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 using the most significant feature to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Given that we are not training this on actual data, we will choose a feature that is typically considered important for heart disease prediction, such as `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy).

If the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is greater than 0, there is a high likelihood of heart disease. If it is 0, then the patient is less likely to have heart disease. This decision rule will form the inner node of our depth-1 decision tree.

Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Inner node condition: check if the number of major vessels (ca) is greater than 0
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] > 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient likely has heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Patient likely does not have heart disease
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Feature used**: `ca` (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy).
- **Condition at the inner node**: If `ca > 0`, the patient is predicted to have heart disease (prediction = 1). If `ca = 0`, the patient is predicted not to have heart disease (prediction = 0).
- **`nodes[0]`** stores the result of the condition (`ca > 0`), where `True` (1) means the condition is satisfied and `False` (0) means it is not.

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a patient and returns a prediction along with the truth value of the inner node condition.
