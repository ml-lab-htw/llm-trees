Given the Features and the target variable (heart disease, yes = 1, no = 0), let's build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features for predicting heart disease.

In this case, I'll prioritize features based on general domain knowledge about heart disease. Commonly important features are:

1. **ca** (Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy): This is a strong indicator of heart disease.
2. **thalach** (Maximum heart rate achieved): Lower maximum heart rate is often associated with heart problems.
3. **oldpeak** (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest): A higher value may indicate heart issues.

Now, let's build the decision tree:

### Decision Tree:

- First node: `ca` (Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy) <= 1.0
  - If true (ca <= 1.0): Move to the second node
  - If false (ca > 1.0): Predict heart disease (1)

- Second node: `thalach` (Maximum heart rate achieved) <= 150
  - If true (thalach <= 150): Predict heart disease (1)
  - If false (thalach > 150): Predict no heart disease (0)

This tree has 2 inner nodes and a maximum depth of 2. Now, we format it into a Python function:

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: ca <= 1.0
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 1.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second decision node: thalach <= 150
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 150
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` which contains the features.
- It checks the first condition (`ca <= 1.0`). If true, it moves to the next condition (`thalach <= 150`).
- Depending on the values of these conditions, it makes a prediction of heart disease or no heart disease.
- It returns the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

### Example Usage:

If we have a patient with the following features:

```python
X = {
    "age": 58,
    "sex": 1,  # male
    "chest_pain": 3,  # typical angina
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,  # false
    "restecg": 2,  # normal
    "thalach": 145,  # maximum heart rate achieved
    "exang": 2,  # yes, exercise induced angina
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 2,  # flat slope
    "ca": 1,  # 1 major vessel colored by fluoroscopy
    "thal": 2  # normal thalassemia
}
```

You can call the function like this:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output:

```
Prediction: 1, Inner nodes: [True, True]
```

This means the model predicts that the patient has heart disease (1), and both conditions (`ca <= 1.0` and `thalach <= 150`) were satisfied (`True`).
