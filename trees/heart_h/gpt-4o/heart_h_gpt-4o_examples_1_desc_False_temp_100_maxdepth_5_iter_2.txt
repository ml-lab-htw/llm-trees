Here is a decision tree of depth 5 based on the Features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Inner Nodes
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 1  # Check number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
    nodes[1] = X["thal"] == 3  # Check if thalassemia is reversible defect
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5  # Check ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    nodes[3] = X["age"] > 55  # Check if age is greater than 55
    nodes[4] = X["chol"] > 240  # Check if cholesterol level is above 240
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # High risk of heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Low risk of heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low risk of heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # High risk due to age
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Low risk
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1  # High risk due to cholesterol
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Low risk

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

- **Node 0**: The tree first checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 1. This feature is important because it assesses the number of affected vessels, which is a significant indicator in determining heart disease risk.
  
- **Node 1**: If the number of vessels is less than or equal to 1, the next check is whether the patient has a reversible defect in thalassemia (`thal == 3`). A reversible defect is a strong indicator of heart disease.

- **Node 2**: If the patient has a reversible defect, the model checks if the ST depression induced by exercise (`oldpeak`) is greater than 1.5. Higher values here indicate a greater likelihood of heart disease.

- **Node 3**: If the ST depression is elevated, the model evaluates the patient's age. If the patient is over 55 years old, the model predicts a higher risk of heart disease.

- **Node 4**: If the number of major vessels is greater than 1, the model checks cholesterol (`chol`). If it is higher than 240 mg/dl, the patient is considered to have a high risk of heart disease.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
features = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": 1,
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 1,
    "thalach": 160,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 2.0,
    "slope": 3,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 3
}

# Predict heart disease presence and get the truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the function would return a prediction of `1` (indicating the presence of heart disease) and the values of the inner nodes (e.g., `[True, True, True, True, False]`), which show which conditions were satisfied in the decision process.
