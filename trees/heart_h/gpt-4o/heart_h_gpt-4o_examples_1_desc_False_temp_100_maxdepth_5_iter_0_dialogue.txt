Here is the Python function based on the features and target variable descriptions you provided. The tree structure follows the earlier decision tree I suggested, formatted into a function capable of returning both a prediction and the list of truth values for the nodes in the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    # Nodes based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.8  # ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.8
    nodes[2] = X["thal"] == 1  # Thalassemia == Fixed defect
    nodes[3] = X["thalach"] <= 140  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 140
    nodes[4] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise Induced Angina == yes

    # Decision tree logic for prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # ST Depression > 1.8
            if nodes[2]:  # Thalassemia == Fixed defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease (yes)
            else:  # Thalassemia != Fixed defect
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease (no)
        else:  # ST Depression <= 1.8
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease (no)
    else:  # Chest Pain Type != Asymptomatic
        if nodes[3]:  # Max Heart Rate <= 140
            if nodes[4]:  # Exercise Induced Angina == yes
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease (yes)
            else:  # Exercise Induced Angina == no
                prediction = 1 if X["thal"] == 3 else 0  # Thalassemia: Reversible defect (yes), otherwise no
        else:  # Max Heart Rate > 140
            prediction = 1 if X["ca"] > 0 else 0  # Major Vessels: > 0 (yes), == 0 (no)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input (`X`)**:
   - The function accepts a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names provided in your dataset (`"age"`, `"sex"`, `"chest_pain"`, etc.).
2. **Nodes**:
   - A list, `nodes`, tracks the evaluation (True/False) at each inner node of the decision tree.
3. **Conditions**:
   - Each condition maps to a decision node in the tree. The thresholds for the nodes are filled using meaningful values based on the given ranges and common medical thresholds.
4. **Logic**:
   - Each `if-else` block corresponds to a branch in the tree, checking the condition at each depth.

### Example Use:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 236,
    "fbs": 1,  # Fasting Blood Sugar: False
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 150,  # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    "exang": 1,  # Exercise Induced Angina: No
    "oldpeak": 2.3,  # ST Depression
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 0,  # Major Vessels Colored
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # List of truth values for the inner nodes
```

### Output for the Example:
```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [True, True, False, False, False]
```

This means the patient is predicted to have heart disease (1), and the list `[True, True, False, False, False]` reflects which conditions were satisfied during the tree traversal.
