Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function will return a prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features with the following keys:
        - 'age'
        - 'sex'
        - 'chest_pain'
        - 'trestbps'
        - 'chol'
        - 'fbs'
        - 'restecg'
        - 'thalach'
        - 'exang'
        - 'oldpeak'
        - 'slope'
        - 'ca'
        - 'thal'
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if chest pain type is asymptomatic (0)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check if maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) is <= 140
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Chest pain type is asymptomatic
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # Chest pain type is not asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # Maximum heart rate achieved is <= 140
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:  # Maximum heart rate achieved is > 140
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Here is an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Example input features
patient_features = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 1,  # Atypical angina
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,  # False
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 145,  # Maximum heart rate achieved
    "exang": 1,  # No exercise-induced angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 2  # Normal
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (No heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0, 0]
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the chest pain type is "asymptomatic" (`chest_pain == 0`). If true, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
2. **Node 1**: If the chest pain type is not "asymptomatic," the second condition checks if the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 140. If true, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`); otherwise, the patient is classified as not having heart disease (`prediction = 0`).

This function is simple, interpretable, and adheres to the maximum depth of 2.
