Hereâ€™s the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier based on the feature set you provided. The tree structure has a maximum depth of 2 and uses clinically relevant thresholds for the selected features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
    # Threshold: <= 0 (no vessels blocked)
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second decision node: Chest Pain Type (chest_pain)
        # Typical angina (3) is associated with no heart disease, while other types might indicate heart disease
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease if major vessels are blocked (ca > 0)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0** checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 0. If no vessels are blocked, we move to the next decision node. If one or more vessels are blocked (`ca > 0`), the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
  
- **Node 1** is activated when no vessels are blocked (`ca <= 0`). It checks the type of chest pain (`chest_pain`). If the patient has typical angina (`chest_pain == 3`), the patient is classified as **No Heart Disease**. Otherwise (for other chest pain types), the patient is classified as **Having Heart Disease**.

### Example:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "age": 54,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 1,  # Atypical angina
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,  # False
    "restecg": 2,  # Normal
    "thalach": 160,
    "exang": 1,  # No exercise-induced angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,  # Flat
    "ca": 0,  # No major vessels blocked
    "thal": 3  # Reversible defect
}

# Predict using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the function checks the number of major vessels (`ca = 0`), proceeds to evaluate chest pain (`chest_pain = 1`), and predicts **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`). The `nodes` list would be `[True, False]`, indicating that the first condition (ca <= 0) was satisfied, but the second condition (chest_pain == 3) was not.
