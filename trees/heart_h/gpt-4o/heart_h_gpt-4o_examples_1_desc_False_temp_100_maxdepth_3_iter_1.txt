Based on the Features and the target variable, I'll construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3, and it will have between 3 and 7 inner nodes. The decision tree will be based on the most important features that are typically indicative of heart disease, such as chest pain, thalassemia, exercise-induced angina, major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and others.

Here is the decision tree represented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check chest pain type (a higher value might suggest lower risk)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest pain type is 'Atypical angina' or 'Asymptomatic' (lower risk)
        # Node 2: Check number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] > 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If there are major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
            prediction = 1  # Predict heart disease
        else:
            # No major vessels colored
            # Node 3: Check thalassemia type (reversible defect is more indicative of disease)
            nodes[2] = X["thal"] == 3
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Predict heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # If chest pain type is 'Typical angina' or 'Non-anginal pain' (higher risk)
        # Node 2: Check exercise-induced angina
        nodes[1] = X["exang"] == 2  # 'Yes' indicates higher risk
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Predict heart disease
        else:
            # Node 3: Check maximum heart rate achieved (lower heart rate indicates higher risk)
            nodes[2] = X["thalach"] <= 150
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Predict heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:

1. **Node 1:** The first condition checks the **chest pain type** (`chest_pain`). If the chest pain type is `Atypical angina (1)` or `Asymptomatic (0)`, the decision tree proceeds to assess further risk factors. If the chest pain type is higher (i.e., `Typical angina (3)` or `Non-anginal pain (2)`), it will take a different path.
   
2. **Node 2:** Depending on the result of **Node 1**, the next decision is based on the **number of major vessels colored** (`ca`). If there are no major vessels colored, the decision tree moves to **Node 3**, where it checks other factors like **thalassemia**. If there are major vessels colored (`ca > 0`), it predicts heart disease.

3. **Node 3:** If the chest pain and major vessels don't indicate heart disease, it checks **thalassemia** (`thal`). If the patient has a `reversible defect (3)`, it predicts heart disease. Otherwise, it predicts no heart disease.

4. In the case where the chest pain is `Typical angina` or `Non-anginal pain`, it checks if the patient has **exercise-induced angina** (`exang`). If `yes`, it predicts heart disease. If not, it checks the **maximum heart rate achieved** (`thalach`), where a lower heart rate indicates a higher risk of heart disease.

This decision tree is designed to capture important medical markers associated with heart disease.
