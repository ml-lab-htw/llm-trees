Below is the Python function that implements the heart disease classifier decision tree with a depth of 3. The function takes a dictionary `X` (with the specified spelling of feature keys) and returns the classifier's prediction as well as the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Implementation

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Track the outcomes of inner nodes
    
    # Condition at the root (Node 0): Chest Pain Type == 0 (Asymptomatic)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic
        # Condition at Node 1: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 1
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 1

        if nodes[1]:  # If Number of Major Vessels <= 1
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels > 1
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    else:  # If Chest Pain Type is not Asymptomatic
        # Condition at Node 2: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved <= 140 (thalach)
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140

        if nodes[1]:  # If Maximum Heart Rate <= 140
            # Condition at Node 3: Thalassemia == 1 (Fixed defect)
            nodes[2] = X["thal"] == 1

            if nodes[2]:  # If Thalassemia is Fixed defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # If Thalassemia is not Fixed defect
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

        else:  # If Maximum Heart Rate > 140
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function
- **Inputs**: 
  - `X`: A dictionary representing the input features. Each key corresponds to a specific feature as defined. For example:
    ```python
    sample_input = {
        "age": 50,
        "sex": "male",
        "chest_pain": 0,
        "trestbps": 130,
        "chol": 240,
        "fbs": 1,
        "restecg": 2,
        "thalach": 120,
        "exang": 1,
        "oldpeak": 2.3,
        "slope": 2,
        "ca": 2,
        "thal": 1,
    }
    ```
- **Outputs**:
  - `prediction`: The classifier's output, where `1` indicates that the patient has heart disease, and `0` indicates they do not.
  - `nodes`: A list of Boolean values representing whether the conditions of the corresponding inner nodes are satisfied (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`).

### Sample Input and Output
#### Input:
```python
input_sample = {
    "age": 56,
    "sex": "female",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 120,
    "chol": 230,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 130,  # Maximum Heart Rate
    "exang": 1,
    "oldpeak": 1.0,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,  # Number of Major Vessels
    "thal": 2,  # Thalassemia: Normal
}
```

#### Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(input_sample)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Nodes: [True, True, None]
```

- **Explanation**:
  - First condition (`node[0]`): The patient has chest pain type 0 (Asymptomatic), so `nodes[0] = True`.
  - Second condition (`node[1]`): `ca` (number of major vessels) is `1`, which satisfies the condition `ca <= 1`. Thus, `nodes[1] = True`.
  - Since the second condition is satisfied, the model predicts `0` (No Heart Disease). Node 3 is not evaluated, so `nodes[2] = None`.

### Example Decision Flow
1. **Root Decision**: Whether chest_pain is `0` (Asymptomatic).
2. **Second Decision** (if Chest Pain = 0): Whether `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored) is `<= 1`.
3. **Second Decision** (if Chest Pain â‰  0): Whether `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is `<= 140`.
4. **Third Decision** (if `thalach` <= 140): Whether `thal` (Thalassemia) is `1` (Fixed defect). 

This function implements the depth-3 decision tree classifier consistent with the given problem and feature specifications.
