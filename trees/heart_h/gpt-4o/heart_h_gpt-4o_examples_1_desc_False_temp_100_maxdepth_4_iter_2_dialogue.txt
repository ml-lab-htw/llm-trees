Here is the Python function to represent the decision tree model for predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. The function returns a prediction (`0` for no heart disease, `1` for heart disease) and a list containing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Since the max depth is 4, there can be a maximum of 7 inner nodes (binary splits).
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic (most indicative of heart disease)
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140  # Maximum heart rate achieved
    nodes[2] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise induced angina (yes)
    nodes[3] = X["ca"] >= 2  # Number of major vessels (2 or more)
    nodes[4] = X["age"] > 55  # Older age is more associated with heart disease
    nodes[5] = X["thal"] == 1  # Fixed defect linked to heart issues
    nodes[6] = X["trestbps"] > 130  # Resting blood pressure threshold

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Chest Pain Type == Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # Maximum Heart Rate <= 140
            if nodes[2]:  # Exercise Induced Angina == yes
                if nodes[3]:  # Number of Major Vessels >= 2
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:  # Exercise Induced Angina == no
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # Maximum Heart Rate > 140
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:  # Chest Pain Type != Asymptomatic
        if nodes[4]:  # Age > 55
            if nodes[5]:  # Thalassemia == Fixed defect
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # Thalassemia != Fixed defect
                if nodes[6]:  # Resting Blood Pressure > 130
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # Age <= 55
            if X["slope"] == 2:  # Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment == Flat
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # Slope != Flat
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes List**:
   The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes, representing whether each condition is satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false).

2. **Tree Conditions**:
   Each internal node corresponds to a condition based on the features provided.

   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `chest_pain` equals `0` (Asymptomatic).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved) is less than or equal to 140 bpm, a common threshold for identifying abnormal heart rates.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina) equals `2` (yes).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy) is greater than or equal to 2, which is associated with significant heart abnormalities.
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if `age` is greater than 55 years, a risk factor for heart disease.
   - `nodes[5]`: Checks if `thal` (Thalassemia) equals `1` (Fixed defect), a feature associated with heart defects.
   - `nodes[6]`: Checks if `trestbps` (Resting Blood Pressure) is greater than 130 mmHg, a typical threshold for high blood pressure.

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   The decision structure builds a binary tree based on the conditions. Starting at the root (`nodes[0]`), the function moves down the tree based on the feature values in the input dictionary `X`.

4. **Inputs**:
   - `X`: A dictionary containing the feature values with keys as described.

5. **Outputs**:
   - `prediction`: The final classification (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease).
   - `nodes`: The list of truth values for the internal nodes, showing which conditions were satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "age": 60,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,
    "trestbps": 145,
    "chol": 233,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 120,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 2,
    "thal": 1
}

# Get the prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart Disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True, True, True, True, True]
