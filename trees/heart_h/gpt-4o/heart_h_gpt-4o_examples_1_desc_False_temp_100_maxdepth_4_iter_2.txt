Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 based on the Features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check chest pain type
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic chest pain
    
    # Node 2: Check thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 150
    
    # Node 3: Check oldpeak (ST depression)
    nodes[2] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.5
    
    # Node 4: Check ca (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy)
    nodes[3] = X["ca"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Chest pain is asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach > 150
            if nodes[2]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
                if nodes[3]:  # ca == 0
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:  # Chest pain is not asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # thalach > 150
            if nodes[2]:  # oldpeak <= 1.5
                if nodes[3]:  # ca == 0
                    prediction = 0  # No heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
- **Node 1:** The tree initially checks if the patient has asymptomatic chest pain (`chest_pain == 0`). Asymptomatic chest pain is often associated with a higher likelihood of heart disease.
- **Node 2:** If the patient has asymptomatic chest pain, the next check is whether their maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is greater than 150. A higher heart rate is often associated with better cardiovascular function, so a lower heart rate might indicate a higher risk of heart disease.
- **Node 3:** The next check is the ST depression induced by exercise (`oldpeak <= 1.5`). Lower ST depression values suggest less severe heart disease.
- **Node 4:** Finally, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is checked. A value of `0` indicates no major blockages, which is a good sign for heart health.

The decision tree returns a **prediction** (either `1` for heart disease or `0` for no heart disease) and also returns the **nodes list**, which contains the truth values (`1` for true, `0` for false) for the conditions in the inner nodes.
