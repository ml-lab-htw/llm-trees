### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: If cholesterol (`chol`) is greater than 240, it is considered high, which is a risk factor for heart disease.
- **nodes[1]**: If maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is less than or equal to 150, this could be a sign of reduced cardiovascular function, often associated with heart disease.
- **nodes[2]**: If number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is greater than 0, this suggests a higher likelihood of cardiovascular issues.
- **nodes[3]**: If ST depression induced by exercise (`oldpeak`) is greater than 1.0, it indicates ischemia, which is a sign of heart disease.

The decision tree makes predictions based on these conditions and returns both the prediction (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease) and a list of truth values representing which conditions were met at each level of the tree.
