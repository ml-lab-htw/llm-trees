Below is the Python function that implements the specified decision tree for predicting whether a patient has heart disease based on the feature **'ca'** (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy).

The function follows the requirements: it returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

---

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a patient has heart disease based on the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values with exact keys given in the specification.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize the nodes list to store truth values for conditions
    nodes = [None]  # Depth 1 tree has only one node
    
    # Check the condition for the first (and only) inner node
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 0.5  # Threshold for 'ca'

    if nodes[0]:  # If 'ca' <= 0.5
        prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:  # If 'ca' > 0.5
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input:**
   - The input `X` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the exact feature names provided in your specification, e.g., `'ca'`.

2. **Inner Node Logic:**
   - The decision tree has one inner node, where we check the value of `'ca'` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy).
   - The threshold chosen is `<= 0.5`, meaning if `'ca'` is 0 or no vessels are affected, we predict **no heart disease**. If `'ca'` is more than 0.5 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 major vessels), we predict **heart disease**.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: The predicted class (1 for heart disease, 0 for no heart disease).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the conditions (in this case, just one condition).

### Example Usage:

#### Example 1: Patient without Heart Disease
```python
X = {
    'age': 45,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 120,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,  # Number of major vessels
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (No heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True]
```

#### Example 2: Patient with Heart Disease
```python
X = {
    'age': 60,
    'sex': 'female',
    'chest_pain': 0,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 300,
    'fbs': 2,
    'restecg': 1,
    'thalach': 120,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 2.5,
    'slope': 1,
    'ca': 2,  # Number of major vessels
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [False]
```
