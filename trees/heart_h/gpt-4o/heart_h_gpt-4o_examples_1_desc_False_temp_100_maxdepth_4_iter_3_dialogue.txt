Below is the Python function implementing a decision tree classifier for predicting whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0). The function makes a prediction based on the inputs' features and returns both the prediction and the corresponding truth values of the intermediate nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """

            - 'chest_pain': Chest Pain Type (3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina)

            - 'fbs': Fasting blood sugar (1 = false, 2 = true)
            - 'restecg': Resting Electrocardiographic Results (2 = Normal, 3 = ST-T wave abnormality, 1 = Left ventricular hypertrophy)
            - 'thalach': Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
            - 'exang': Exercise Induced Angina (1 = no, 2 = yes)
            - 'oldpeak': ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5)
            - 'slope': Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (3 = Upsloping, 2 = Flat, 1 = Downsloping)
            - 'ca': Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3)
            - 'thal': Thalassemia (2 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect)
    
    Returns:

        - nodes: list of int
            A list representing whether the condition of each decision node is satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false)

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 0 (Root):** The decision tree starts by checking if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is greater than 0. This is a strong indicator of the likelihood of heart disease.

2. **Node 1:** If `ca > 0`, the tree checks the type of Thalassemia (`thal`). A "Reversible defect" (coded as 3) is more likely to indicate heart disease.

3. **Node 2:** If `thal` is a "Reversible defect," the tree examines whether the patient experiences exercise-induced angina (`exang`). Exercise-induced angina is also a strong risk factor.

4. **Node 3:** Finally, if the patient has exercise-induced angina, the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (`oldpeak`) is checked. A value over 2.0 is associated with greater risk of heart disease.

If `ca <= 0` at the root, the decision tree evaluates maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) and chest pain type (`chest_pain`) to infer the likelihood of heart disease.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input for a patient
X = {
    'age': 62,
    'sex': 1,
    'chest_pain': 0,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 260,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 140,
    'exang': 2,
    'oldpeak': 2.3,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 2,
    'thal': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds for conditions like `oldpeak`, `thalach`, etc., were chosen based on typical ranges from healthcare data but can be adjusted based on real-world training results.
- This decision tree assumes categorical encoding as described in your feature descriptions. Ensure the input adheres to this encoding.
