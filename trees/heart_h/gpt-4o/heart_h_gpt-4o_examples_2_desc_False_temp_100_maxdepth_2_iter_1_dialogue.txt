Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 as described. This function uses 'Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy' (ca) and 'Chest Pain Type' (chest_pain) as the decision-making features. The function returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # For a tree of depth 2, we need 2 inner nodes.
    
    # Node 0: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy <= 1
    nodes[0] = X["ca"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Chest Pain Type == Typical angina
        nodes[1] = X["chest_pain"] == 3
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    'age': 63,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 1,  # Atypical angina
    'trestbps': 145,
    'chol': 233,
    'fbs': 1,  # false
    'restecg': 3,  # Having ST-T wave abnormality
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,  # no
    'oldpeak': 2.3,
    'slope': 3,  # Upsloping
    'ca': 0,  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    'thal': 3,  # Reversible defect
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes status:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0:** Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 1.
- **Node 1:** Within the group passing Node 0, it checks if the chest pain type (`chest_pain`) is "Typical angina" (encoded as 3).

If both conditions indicate low risk (Node 0 and Node 1 are true), the patient is classified as not having heart disease (`prediction = 0`). Otherwise, the patient is classified as having heart disease (`prediction = 1`).

This function captures the decision logic as described and provides outputs useful for tracing the decision-making process.
