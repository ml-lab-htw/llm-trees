Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable. The function will return a prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a patient has heart disease or not based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the patient's features with the following keys:
        - 'age': age (years)
        - 'sex': sex (male, female)
        - 'chest_pain': Chest Pain Type (3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina)
        - 'trestbps': Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
        - 'chol': Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
        - 'fbs': Fasting Blood Sugar (1 = false, 2 = true)
        - 'restecg': Resting Electrocardiographic Results (2 = Normal, 3 = Having ST-T wave abnormality, 1 = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
        - 'thalach': Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
        - 'exang': Exercise Induced Angina (1 = no, 2 = yes)
        - 'oldpeak': ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5)
        - 'slope': Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (3 = Upsloping, 2 = Flat, 1 = Downsloping)
        - 'ca': Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3)
        - 'thal': Thalassemia (2 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 otherwise.
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check Chest Pain Type
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic chest pain
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
        nodes[1] = X["ca"] <= 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Check Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
        nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
patient_features = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 0,  # Asymptomatic
    "trestbps": 130,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 120,
    "exang": 2,
    "oldpeak": 2.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,
    "thal": 3
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Heart disease)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the patient has "Asymptomatic" chest pain (`chest_pain == 0`). This is a strong indicator of heart disease.
2. **Node 1 (Left Subtree)**: If the patient has "Asymptomatic" chest pain, the next condition checks the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca <= 1`). Fewer vessels are associated with heart disease.
3. **Node 1 (Right Subtree)**: If the patient does not have "Asymptomatic" chest pain, the next condition checks the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach <= 140`). A lower maximum heart rate is associated with heart disease.

This function is designed to be interpretable and uses meaningful thresholds based on medical knowledge.
