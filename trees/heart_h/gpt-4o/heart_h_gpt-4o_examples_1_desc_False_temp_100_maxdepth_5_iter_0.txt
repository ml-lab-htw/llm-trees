Certainly! Based on the Features and target variable provided, here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 5. I've selected key features based on their medical significance to heart disease. Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the chest pain type is less than or equal to 1 (Atypical angina or Asymptomatic)
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] <= 1
    
    # Node 1: Check if the maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) is greater than 150 bpm
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] > 150
    
    # Node 2: Check if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca) is less than or equal to 0
    nodes[2] = X["ca"] <= 0
    
    # Node 3: Check if the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak) is greater than 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] > 1.5
    
    # Node 4: Check if the slope of peak exercise ST segment (slope) is flat (slope = 2)
    nodes[4] = X["slope"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0:** The first condition checks the type of chest pain. If the chest pain type is asymptomatic or atypical angina (`chest_pain <= 1`), it leads to further conditions. If it's a more severe type, we move to the next set of conditions.
   
2. **Node 1:** If the patient's maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach > 150 bpm`) is high, it influences the risk of heart disease.

3. **Node 2:** If the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca <= 0`) is low, it indicates a lower likelihood of heart disease.

4. **Node 3:** If the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (`oldpeak > 1.5`) is high, it suggests more severe heart disease.

5. **Node 4:** If the slope of the peak exercise ST segment is flat (`slope == 2`), this is often associated with heart disease.

### Usage:
The function `predict(X)` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (e.g., "age", "sex", "chest_pain") and the values are the corresponding values for a patient. It returns:
- `prediction`: 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 if they do not.
- `nodes`: A list of boolean values (1 or 0) indicating whether the conditions in the decision tree were satisfied at each inner node.

This decision tree is a simple approximation based on common risk factors for heart disease but is not trained on actual data.
