Let's transform the decision tree for predicting heart disease into a Python function that processes the provided features and returns the prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here is what the function looks like:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    nodes[0] = X["chest_pain"] == 0  # Asymptomatic
    nodes[1] = X["thalach"] <= 140
    nodes[2] = X["exang"] == 2  # Exercise Induced Angina: yes
    nodes[3] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.0
    nodes[4] = X["ca"] == 0  # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy = 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # no heart disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # heart disease
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # no heart disease
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # heart disease
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # no heart disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # heart disease

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage:
X = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 1,  # Atypical angina
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,  # Fasting Blood Sugar: false
    'restecg': 2,  # Normal
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,  # no
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,  # Flat
    'ca': 1,  # Number of Major Vessels: 1
    'thal': 3  # Reversible defect
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction (1=heart disease, 0=no heart disease): ", prediction)
print("Nodes condition results: ", nodes)
```

This function:

1. Initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
2. Evaluates the conditions at each node and stores the results in the `nodes` list.
3. Uses nested conditions to navigate through the decision tree and make the final prediction.
4. Returns the prediction and the list of truth values of the inner nodes.

Feel free to modify the function to fit additional or different conditions if further detailed thresholds or more features are needed.
