Sure! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree, formatted as per your instructions. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` of feature values, returns a single prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease), and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize the list of node conditions
    
    # Node 0: Check if Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic (0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['chest_pain'] == 0)
    
    # Node 1: Check if Exercise Induced Angina is Yes (2)
    nodes[1] = int(X['exang'] == 2)
    
    # Node 2: Check if Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy is greater than 0
    nodes[2] = int(X['ca'] > 0)
    
    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - `chest_pain`:
    - `0`: Asymptomatic
    - `1`: Atypical angina
    - `2`: Non-anginal pain
    - `3`: Typical angina
  - `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina):
    - `1`: No
    - `2`: Yes
  - `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy):
    - Values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`

- **Nodes Explanation:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the chest pain type is **Asymptomatic** (`chest_pain == 0`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if exercise-induced angina is **Yes** (`exang == 2`).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is greater than `0` (`ca > 0`).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **First**, if the patient has asymptomatic chest pain (`nodes[0] == 1`), they are predicted to have heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Else**, if the patient experiences exercise-induced angina (`nodes[1] == 1`), they are predicted to have heart disease.
  - **Else**, if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy is greater than `0` (`nodes[2] == 1`), they are predicted to have heart disease.
  - **Else**, the patient is predicted **not** to have heart disease (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the function with an example patient data:

```python
# Example patient data
X_example = {
    'age': 58,
    'sex': 'male',  # Note: 'sex' feature is not used in this decision tree
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 240,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,  # No exercise-induced angina
    'oldpeak': 1.2,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 3
}

# Predict using the decision tree function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Heart Disease' if prediction == 1 else 'No Heart Disease'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Heart Disease
Nodes: [1, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] = 1` because `chest_pain == 0` (Asymptomatic).
- `nodes[1] = 0` because `exang == 1` (No).
- `nodes[2] = 0` because `ca == 0`.

Since `nodes[0] == 1`, the prediction is that the patient **has heart disease**.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` has the correct keys and that the values are encoded as specified.
- The function does not consider features like `'sex'` or `'age'` since they're not part of this particular decision tree.
- This function assumes that the input data has been preprocessed to match the expected encodings.
