Sure! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Features:**

- **age**: Age (years)
- **sex**: Sex (male, female)
- **chest_pain**: Chest Pain Type
  - 3 = Typical angina
  - 0 = Asymptomatic
  - 2 = Non-anginal pain
  - 1 = Atypical angina
- **trestbps**: Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- **chol**: Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting Blood Sugar
  - 1 = false
  - 2 = true
- **restecg**: Resting Electrocardiographic Results
  - 2 = Normal
  - 3 = Having ST-T wave abnormality
  - 1 = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- **thalach**: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
- **exang**: Exercise Induced Angina
  - 1 = no
  - 2 = yes
- **oldpeak**: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5)
- **slope**: Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
  - 3 = Upsloping
  - 2 = Flat
  - 1 = Downsloping
- **ca**: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3)
- **thal**: Thalassemia
  - 2 = Normal
  - 1 = Fixed defect
  - 3 = Reversible defect

**Target Variable:**

- **target**: Patient has a heart disease or not (yes = 1, no = 0)

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if chest pain type is Asymptomatic (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['chest_pain'] == 0)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If chest_pain == 0 (Asymptomatic)
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if maximum heart rate achieved is greater than 150 bpm
        nodes[1] = int(X['thalach'] > 150)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Node 0 (Depth 0):**
   - **Condition:** `X['chest_pain'] == 0`
     - Checks if the chest pain type is **Asymptomatic**.
   - **nodes[0]:**
     - `1` if the condition is true (chest pain is Asymptomatic).
     - `0` otherwise.
   - **Action:**
     - If `nodes[0] == 1`, classify as **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else, proceed to node 1.

2. **Node 1 (Depth 1):**
   - **Condition:** `X['thalach'] > 150`
     - Checks if the maximum heart rate achieved is greater than **150 bpm**.
   - **nodes[1]:**
     - `1` if the condition is true (thalach > 150).
     - `0` otherwise.
   - **Action:**
     - If `nodes[1] == 1`, classify as **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).
     - Else, classify as **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample patient data
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 1,      # Atypical angina
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,             # false
    'restecg': 2,         # Normal
    'thalach': 160,       # Maximum heart rate achieved
    'exang': 1,           # no
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 2,           # Flat
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2             # Normal
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")     # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")               # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Nodes List:** `[0, 1]`
  - `nodes[0] = 0`: Chest pain is not Asymptomatic (`chest_pain` != 0).
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: Maximum heart rate achieved is greater than 150 bpm (`thalach` > 150).
- **Prediction:** `0` (No Heart Disease)

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.
- It utilizes the most important features:
  - **Chest Pain Type (chest_pain)**
  - **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**
- The conditions and thresholds are based on meaningful clinical insights:
  - **Asymptomatic chest pain** is strongly associated with heart disease.
  - **Lower maximum heart rates** during exertion may indicate underlying heart conditions.

**Conclusion:**

This function can be used to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on the provided features. The `nodes` list helps to trace the decision path taken during the prediction.
