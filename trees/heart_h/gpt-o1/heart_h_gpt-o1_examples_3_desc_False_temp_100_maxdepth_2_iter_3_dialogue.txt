Sure, here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Features:**

- **age**: Age (years)
- **sex**: Sex
  - `male`
  - `female`
- **chest_pain**: Chest Pain Type
  - `3` = Typical angina
  - `0` = Asymptomatic
  - `2` = Non-anginal pain
  - `1` = Atypical angina
- **trestbps**: Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)
- **chol**: Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl)
- **fbs**: Fasting Blood Sugar
  - `1` = false
  - `2` = true
- **restecg**: Resting Electrocardiographic Results
  - `2` = Normal
  - `3` = Having ST-T wave abnormality
  - `1` = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- **thalach**: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
- **exang**: Exercise Induced Angina
  - `1` = no
  - `2` = yes
- **oldpeak**: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5)
- **slope**: Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
  - `3` = Upsloping
  - `2` = Flat
  - `1` = Downsloping
- **ca**: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`)
- **thal**: Thalassemia
  - `2` = Normal
  - `1` = Fixed defect
  - `3` = Reversible defect

**Target Variable:**

- **target**: Patient has a heart disease or not
  - `1` = yes (Has Heart Disease)
  - `0` = no  (Does not have Heart Disease)

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Node 0: Check if Exercise Induced Angina is 'no' (exang == 1)
    nodes[0] = X["exang"] == 1
    # Node 1: Check if ST Depression Induced by Exercise (oldpeak) <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["oldpeak"] <= 2.0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Has Heart Disease

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

The decision tree uses two features to classify whether a patient has heart disease:

1. **Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)**:
   - **Node 0 Condition**: `exang == 1` (Patient does **not** experience exercise-induced angina).
     - If **True** (`nodes[0] = 1`), the patient is classified as **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **False** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to Node 1.

2. **ST Depression Induced by Exercise (`oldpeak`)**:
   - **Node 1 Condition**: `oldpeak <= 2.0`
     - If **True** (`nodes[1] = 1`), the patient is classified as **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **False** (`nodes[1] = 0`), the patient is classified as **Has Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a patient's data:

```python
patient_data = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 2,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 2,      # 'yes' - experiences exercise-induced angina
    "oldpeak": 1.5,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 0,
    "thal": 2
}
```

We can make a prediction:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")      # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")                # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 0`: The patient experiences exercise-induced angina (`exang = 2`).
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The patient's ST depression (`oldpeak = 1.5`) is less than or equal to 2.0.
- Based on the decision tree, the patient is classified as **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).

---

**Note on Thresholds:**

- The threshold value for **ST Depression Induced by Exercise (`oldpeak`)** is set at `2.0`. This is a clinically meaningful value, as higher ST depression values often indicate more significant myocardial ischemia.
