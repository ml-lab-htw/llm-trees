Here's the Python function that represents the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    nodes[0] = int(X['ca'] <= 0.5)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a patient. It uses the 'Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy' (`'ca'`) to make a prediction:

- If `'ca'` is **0**, the condition `X['ca'] <= 0.5` is satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `1`), and the function predicts **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`).
- If `'ca'` is **1**, **2**, or **3**, the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `0`), and the function predicts **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).

The `nodes` list contains the truth value of the inner node condition, where:

- `nodes[0] = 1` if `X['ca'] <= 0.5` is **True**
- `nodes[0] = 0` if `X['ca'] <= 0.5` is **False**

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_features = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 2,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the feature `'ca'` in your input dictionary `X` is represented as an integer (0, 1, 2, or 3) according to the encoding provided.
