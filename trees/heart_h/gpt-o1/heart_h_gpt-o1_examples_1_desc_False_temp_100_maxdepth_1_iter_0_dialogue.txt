Certainly! Based on the features and specifications you've provided, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. The decision tree uses the `oldpeak` feature (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest) to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if 'oldpeak' is less than or equal to 1.0
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.0

    if nodes[0]:
        # 'oldpeak' is less than or equal to 1.0
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        # 'oldpeak' is greater than 1.0
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `oldpeak` (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest)
  - This feature measures the depression in the ST segment of an ECG after exercise compared to rest. Higher values generally indicate more severe heart conditions.
- **Threshold:** `1.0`
  - A threshold of `1.0` is chosen as a meaningful value based on medical studies and statistical analysis of datasets related to heart disease.
  
**Function Details:**

- **Input:** `X` is a dictionary containing the patient's features. The keys must exactly match the feature names provided:

  ```python
  ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg',
   'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']
  ```

- **Nodes List:** `nodes` is a list that records the truth value of the decision at each inner node.
  - `nodes[0]` stores the result (`True` or `False`) of the condition `X["oldpeak"] <= 1.0`.
  
- **Predictions:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., `oldpeak` â‰¤ 1.0), the function predicts `0`, indicating **No Heart Disease**.
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (i.e., `oldpeak` > 1.0), the function predicts `1`, indicating **Heart Disease**.
  
- **Output:** The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (`0` or `1`).
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values of the inner nodes (in this case, only one node).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'age': 54,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 246,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 173,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 0.0,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encodings and Ranges:** Be sure to use the specified encodings for categorical features and ensure numerical features fall within expected ranges.
- **Threshold Justification:** The threshold value was chosen based on common medical interpretations of `oldpeak`. Values greater than `1.0` often indicate significant ST depression, which is associated with heart disease.
- **Depth of Tree:** The decision tree has a maximum depth of `1`, using only a single feature to make the classification.

Feel free to use this function and adjust the threshold if you have access to specific data or domain knowledge that suggests a different cutoff value would be more appropriate.
