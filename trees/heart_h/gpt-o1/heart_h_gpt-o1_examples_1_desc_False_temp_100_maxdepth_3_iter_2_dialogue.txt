Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. It returns a prediction (`0` for "No Heart Disease", `1` for "Heart Disease") and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries in this list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    # Node 0: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca) <= 0.5
    nodes[0] = int(X['ca'] <= 0.5)

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak) <= 1.0
        nodes[1] = int(X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0)
        nodes[2] = None  # No third node on this path
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        nodes[1] = None
        # Node 2: Thalassemia (thal) == 3 (Reversible defect)
        nodes[2] = int(X['thal'] == 3)
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` with three entries, corresponding to the maximum depth of the tree. Each entry will be `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` if not, and `None` if that node isn't used in that path.

- **Node 0:** Checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to `0.5` (effectively `0` since `ca` is an integer value of `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`).

  ```python
  nodes[0] = int(X['ca'] <= 0.5)
  ```

- **If Node 0 Condition is Satisfied:** (i.e., `ca` is `0`)

  - **Node 1:** Evaluates the `oldpeak` feature, which is the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

    ```python
    nodes[1] = int(X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0)
    ```
  
  - **Prediction:**
    - If `oldpeak` â‰¤ `1.0`, predict **No Heart Disease** (`0`).
    - If `oldpeak` > `1.0`, predict **Heart Disease** (`1`).
  
- **Else:** (i.e., `ca` is `1`, `2`, or `3`)

  - **Node 2:** Checks if the `thal` feature (Thalassemia) equals `3` (Reversible defect).

    ```python
    nodes[2] = int(X['thal'] == 3)
    ```

  - **Prediction:**
    - If `thal` equals `3`, predict **Heart Disease** (`1`).
    - If `thal` is not `3`, predict **No Heart Disease** (`0`).

**Feature Keys and Encoding:**

- **'ca'**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`).
- **'oldpeak'**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (`0` to `5`).
- **'thal'**: Thalassemia (`1` = Fixed defect, `2` = Normal, `3` = Reversible defect).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 2,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 240,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 3
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Heart Disease
Nodes: [1, 0, None]
```

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: Condition `ca <= 0.5` is **True**.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: Condition `oldpeak <= 1.0` is **False**.
  - `nodes[2] = None`: Not used in this path.

**Thresholds Explanation:**

- **Threshold for 'ca':** Using `<= 0.5` effectively checks if `ca` is `0`, since `ca` can only be `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`.

- **Threshold for 'oldpeak':** A value of `1.0` is meaningful in clinical settings; higher `oldpeak` values often indicate more significant heart stress during exercise.

- **Value for 'thal':** A `thal` value of `3` corresponds to a **Reversible Defect**, which is a significant indicator of heart disease.

**Conclusion:**

This function follows the structure of the decision tree with a maximum depth of 3. It uses the most important features (`ca`, `oldpeak`, `thal`) to classify patients regarding the presence of heart disease. The `nodes` list provides insight into the decisions made at each node of the tree for a given patient's data.
