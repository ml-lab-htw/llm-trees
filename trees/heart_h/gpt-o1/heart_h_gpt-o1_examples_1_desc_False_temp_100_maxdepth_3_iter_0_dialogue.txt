Certainly! Here is the Python function `predict` that implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and encodings. The function returns a single prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease) and a list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) corresponding to the inner nodes of the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['chest_pain'] == 0 else 0

    # Node 1: Check if Exercise Induced Angina is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['exang'] == 2 else 0

    # Node 2: Check if Maximum Heart Rate Achieved is less than or equal to 140 bpm
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['thalach'] <= 140 else 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # If Exercise Induced Angina is yes
            prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
        else:  # If Exercise Induced Angina is no
            prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:  # If Chest Pain Type is not Asymptomatic
        if nodes[2]:  # If Max Heart Rate Achieved <= 140 bpm
            prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
        else:  # If Max Heart Rate Achieved > 140 bpm
            prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `'chest_pain'`: Chest Pain Type (3 = Typical angina, **0 = Asymptomatic**, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 1 = Atypical angina)
  - `'exang'`: Exercise Induced Angina (**1 = no**, **2 = yes**)
  - `'thalach'`: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)

- **Inner Nodes and Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `chest_pain == 0` (Asymptomatic).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `exang == 2` (Exercise Induced Angina is 'yes').
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `thalach <= 140` bpm.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **Node 0:** If `chest_pain` is Asymptomatic (`nodes[0] == 1`):
    - **Node 1:** Regardless of whether `exang` is 'yes' or 'no', the patient is predicted to have heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Node 0:** If `chest_pain` is not Asymptomatic (`nodes[0] == 0`):
    - **Node 2:** If `thalach <= 140` bpm (`nodes[2] == 1`):
      - Predict heart disease (`prediction = 1`).
    - **Node 2:** If `thalach > 140` bpm (`nodes[2] == 0`):
      - Predict no heart disease (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a patient with the following features:

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,    # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,     # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    'exang': 2,         # Exercise Induced Angina: yes
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")          # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")        # Output: Node Truth Values: [1, 1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- The patient has Asymptomatic chest pain (`nodes[0] == 1`).
- The patient has Exercise Induced Angina (`nodes[1] == 1`).
- The Maximum Heart Rate Achieved condition is not evaluated for this patient path.
- The model predicts that the patient **has heart disease** (`prediction == 1`).
