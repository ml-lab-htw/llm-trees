Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the provided feature keys and encodings, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca) <= 0.5
    nodes[0] = int(X["ca"] <= 0.5)

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak) <= 1.0
        nodes[1] = int(X["oldpeak"] <= 1.0)
        # Since the next node is not evaluated in this path, set it to 0
        nodes[2] = 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        # Node 1 is not evaluated in this path
        nodes[1] = 0
        # Node 2: Exercise Induced Angina (exang) == yes (encoded as 2)
        nodes[2] = int(X["exang"] == 2)
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `ca`: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3)
  - `oldpeak`: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5)
  - `exang`: Exercise Induced Angina (1 = no, 2 = yes)

- **Decision Tree Conditions:**
  - **Node 0:** Check if `ca` ≤ 0.5 (which effectively checks if `ca` == 0)
    - If **yes** (ca == 0):
      - **Node 1:** Check if `oldpeak` ≤ 1.0
        - If **yes**, predict **No Heart Disease** (0)
        - If **no**, predict **Heart Disease** (1)
    - If **no** (ca > 0):
      - **Node 2:** Check if `exang` == 2 (Exercise Induced Angina == yes)
        - If **yes**, predict **Heart Disease** (1)
        - If **no**, predict **No Heart Disease** (0)

- **Nodes List:**
  - Each entry corresponds to an inner node condition:
    - `1` if the condition is **satisfied**
    - `0` if the condition is **not satisfied** or **not evaluated** in that path

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    "age": 55,
    "sex": "male",
    "chest_pain": 3,
    "trestbps": 140,
    "chol": 250,
    "fbs": 1,
    "restecg": 2,
    "thalach": 150,
    "exang": 2,       # Exercise Induced Angina (yes)
    "oldpeak": 2.3,
    "slope": 2,
    "ca": 1,          # Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
    "thal": 3
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with correct keys and encodings.
- The function strictly follows the feature keys and encodings provided.
- The prediction is `1` for **Heart Disease** and `0` for **No Heart Disease**.
- The nodes list provides insight into which conditions were met during the prediction process.
