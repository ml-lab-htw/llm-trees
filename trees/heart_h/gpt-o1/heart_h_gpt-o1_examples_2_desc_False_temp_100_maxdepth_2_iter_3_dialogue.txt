Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier based on the features and conditions provided. This function follows the format you've specified, returning a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    # Node 0: Check if Exercise Induced Angina is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["exang"] == 2)
    # Node 1: Check if Maximum Heart Rate Achieved is less than or equal to 150 bpm
    nodes[1] = int(X["thalach"] <= 150)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Exercise Induced Angina is 'yes'
        prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
    else:
        # If Exercise Induced Angina is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Maximum Heart Rate Achieved is less than or equal to 150 bpm
            prediction = 1  # Patient has heart disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Patient does not have heart disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `exang`: Exercise Induced Angina
    - Encoded as `1` for **no**
    - Encoded as `2` for **yes**
  - `thalach`: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved in beats per minute (bpm)

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Truth value of the first condition (`X["exang"] == 2`)
    - `1` if the patient experiences exercise-induced angina (`yes`)
    - `0` otherwise
  - `nodes[1]`: Truth value of the second condition (`X["thalach"] <= 150`)
    - `1` if the patient's maximum heart rate achieved is less than or equal to 150 bpm
    - `0` otherwise

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **First Condition (`nodes[0]`):**
     - If the patient has exercise-induced angina (`exang` == `2`), they are classified as having **heart disease**.
  2. **Second Condition (`nodes[1]`):**
     - If the patient does **not** have exercise-induced angina (`exang` != `2`), we check the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`).
     - If `thalach` ≤ 150 bpm, the patient is classified as having **heart disease**.
     - If `thalach` > 150 bpm, the patient is classified as **not** having heart disease.

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The classification result.
    - `1` indicates the patient **has heart disease**.
    - `0` indicates the patient **does not have heart disease**.
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    - Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient = {
    'age': 54,
    'sex': 'male',           # Use appropriate encoding if needed
    'chest_pain': 1,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 140,
    'exang': 1,              # Patient does not have exercise-induced angina
    'oldpeak': 1.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `Prediction: 1` means the model predicts that the patient **has heart disease**.
  - `Nodes: [0, 1]` indicates:
    - `nodes[0] = 0`: The patient does **not** have exercise-induced angina.
    - `nodes[1] = 1`: The patient's maximum heart rate achieved is **≤ 150 bpm**.

**Note on Feature Encodings:**

Please ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys and encodings specified:

- **Feature Keys:**
  - `'age'`
  - `'sex'` (encode as needed based on your data)
  - `'chest_pain'`
  - `'trestbps'`
  - `'chol'`
  - `'fbs'`
  - `'restecg'`
  - `'thalach'`
  - `'exang'`
  - `'oldpeak'`
  - `'slope'`
  - `'ca'`
  - `'thal'`

- **Target Variable:**
  - `'target'`: Patient has heart disease (`1` for **yes**, `0` for **no**)

**Feature Encodings:**

- `'exang'`: Exercise Induced Angina
  - `1`: **No**
  - `2`: **Yes**
- `'thalach'`: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
  - Numeric value in bpm

**Explanation of Decision Thresholds:**

- **Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`):**
  - Presence of exercise-induced angina is a strong indicator of heart disease.
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (`thalach`):**
  - A maximum heart rate achieved of **≤ 150 bpm** during exercise testing can indicate a diminished cardiovascular response, suggestive of underlying heart disease.

By using these features and thresholds, the decision tree provides a simple yet clinically relevant model for predicting heart disease.
