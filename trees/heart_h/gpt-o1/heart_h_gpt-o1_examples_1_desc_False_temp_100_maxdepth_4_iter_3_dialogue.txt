Certainly! Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier you provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features (with exact keys as specified) and returns a prediction (`0` for "No Heart Disease" and `1` for "Heart Disease") along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list of 5 elements for the nodes

    # Node 0: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca) <= 0
    nodes[0] = X['ca'] <= 0
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Chest Pain Type (chest_pain) == Typical angina (3)
        nodes[1] = X['chest_pain'] == 3
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:
            # Node 2: Thalassemia (thal) == Normal (2)
            nodes[2] = X['thal'] == 2
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        # Node 3: Exercise Induced Angina (exang) == Yes (2)
        nodes[3] = X['exang'] == 2
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            # Node 4: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak) <= 1.0
            nodes[4] = X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    # Ensure nodes list has boolean values (convert None to False if not evaluated)
    for i in range(len(nodes)):
        if nodes[i] is None:
            nodes[i] = False
        else:
            nodes[i] = bool(nodes[i])

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'ca'`: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (values: 0, 1, 2, 3)
  - `'chest_pain'`: Chest Pain Type (3 = Typical angina, 0 = Asymptomatic, 1 = Atypical angina, 2 = Non-anginal pain)
  - `'thal'`: Thalassemia (2 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 3 = Reversible defect)
  - `'exang'`: Exercise Induced Angina (1 = No, 2 = Yes)
  - `'oldpeak'`: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (continuous value from 0 to 5)

- **Nodes Explained:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the patient has 0 major vessels colored (`X['ca'] <= 0`)
  - **Node 1:** If Node 0 is `True`, checks if chest pain type is Typical angina (`X['chest_pain'] == 3`)
  - **Node 2:** If Node 1 is `False`, checks if thalassemia result is Normal (`X['thal'] == 2`)
  - **Node 3:** If Node 0 is `False`, checks if exercise-induced angina is Yes (`X['exang'] == 2`)
  - **Node 4:** If Node 3 is `False`, checks if ST depression is <= 1.0 (`X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0`)

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If **Node 0** is `True`:
    - If **Node 1** is `True`: Predict **0** (No Heart Disease)
    - Else:
      - If **Node 2** is `True`: Predict **0** (No Heart Disease)
      - Else: Predict **1** (Heart Disease)
  - Else:
    - If **Node 3** is `True`: Predict **1** (Heart Disease)
    - Else:
      - If **Node 4** is `True`: Predict **0** (No Heart Disease)
      - Else: Predict **1** (Heart Disease)

- **Nodes List:**
  - The `nodes` list contains the truth values (`True` or `False`) of the inner nodes:
    - `nodes[0]`: Result of `X['ca'] <= 0`
    - `nodes[1]`: Result of `X['chest_pain'] == 3` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `True`)
    - `nodes[2]`: Result of `X['thal'] == 2` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `True` and `nodes[1]` is `False`)
    - `nodes[3]`: Result of `X['exang'] == 2` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`)
    - `nodes[4]`: Result of `X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False` and `nodes[3]` is `False`)

- **Handling Unevaluated Nodes:**
  - Nodes that are not evaluated during the prediction are set to `False` in the `nodes` list to maintain consistent output.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,        # Typical angina
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 160,
    'exang': 1,             # No
    'oldpeak': 0.5,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2               # Normal
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Note:** Ensure that all feature values provided in `X` match the exact keys and encoding as specified. The feature `'sex'` in this function is not used, but if included in the dataset, it should be encoded appropriately (e.g., `'male'` or `'female'`) if used in future models.

This function follows the decision tree structure provided, uses the most significant features, and adheres to the maximum depth of 4 as per your request.
