Certainly! Based on the features provided and aiming to construct a decision tree of depth 1, I'll select a significant feature with a meaningful threshold to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

One of the important features for predicting heart disease is **'oldpeak'** (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest). Elevated 'oldpeak' values are associated with higher risk of heart disease.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Only one inner node at depth 1
    nodes[0] = X["oldpeak"] <= 1.0  # Threshold chosen based on medical insights
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `'oldpeak'` (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest)
- **Threshold:** `1.0` (Patients with 'oldpeak' > 1.0 are more likely to have heart disease)
- **Logic:**
  - If `oldpeak <= 1.0`:
    - `nodes[0]` is `True`
    - Predict `0` (Patient does **not** have heart disease)
  - Else (`oldpeak > 1.0`):
    - `nodes[0]` is `False`
    - Predict `1` (Patient **has** heart disease)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'age': 58,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 3,
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 230,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,
    'oldpeak': 2.3,
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Note:** In this function:

- We strictly adhere to the exact feature keys provided:
  ```python
  ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']
  ```
- The target variable is:
  - `target`: Patient has heart disease or not (`yes = 1`, `no = 0`)

**Alternate Approach Using 'exang' (Exercise Induced Angina):**

If we choose to use the categorical feature `'exang'` (Exercise Induced Angina), which is encoded as `(1 = no, 2 = yes)`, the function would be:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    nodes[0] = X["exang"] == 2  # Checking if 'exang' equals 2 (yes)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    return prediction, nodes
```

But since you requested to "fill them with meaningful values" for thresholds and to follow the example format closely (which uses inequality conditions with thresholds), the initial function using `'oldpeak'` is more aligned with your instructions.

**Summary:**

- The function `predict` uses the feature `'oldpeak'` to make a prediction.
- It returns:
  - `prediction`: `1` if the patient has heart disease, `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes`: A list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions at each node were satisfied.
