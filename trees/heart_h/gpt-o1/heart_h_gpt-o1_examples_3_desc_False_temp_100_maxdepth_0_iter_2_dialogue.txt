Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize a list to store node truth values

    # Node 0: Check if Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['chest_pain'] == 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic
        # Node 1: Check if Number of Major Vessels (ca) > 0.5
        nodes[1] = int(X['ca'] > 0.5)
        # Regardless of 'ca', classify as Heart Disease
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease (yes)
    else:
        # Chest Pain Type is not Asymptomatic
        # Node 1: Check if Exercise Induced Angina is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
        nodes[1] = int(X['exang'] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Exercise Induced Angina is yes
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease (yes)
        else:
            # Exercise Induced Angina is no
            # Node 2: Check if Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 150 bpm
            nodes[2] = int(X['thalach'] > 150)
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease (no)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease (yes)
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

This function implements the decision tree by evaluating the most important features step by step:

- **Node 0** checks if the patient has **Asymptomatic Chest Pain** (`chest_pain == 0`):
  - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`):
    - **Node 1** checks if the **Number of Major Vessels** (`ca`) is greater than 0.5:
      - This condition is included for completeness, but regardless of its truth value, the patient is classified as having **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If **no** (`nodes[0] = 0`):
    - **Node 1** checks if **Exercise Induced Angina** is **yes** (`exang == 2`):
      - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`):
        - The patient is classified as having **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).
      - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`):
        - **Node 2** checks if the **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved** (`thalach`) is greater than 150 bpm:
          - If **yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`):
            - The patient is classified as **not** having Heart Disease (`prediction = 0`).
          - If **no** (`nodes[2] = 0`):
            - The patient is classified as having **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`).

**Key Points:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - `chest_pain`:
    - `0` = **Asymptomatic**
    - `1` = Atypical angina
    - `2` = Non-anginal pain
    - `3` = Typical angina
  - `exang` (Exercise Induced Angina):
    - `1` = **No**
    - `2` = **Yes**
  - `ca` (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy): `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`
  - `thalach` (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved): Numeric value in bpm

- **Nodes List:**
  - Each element in the `nodes` list corresponds to a condition in the decision tree:
    - `1` if the condition is **True**
    - `0` if the condition is **False**
  - The list helps trace the path taken in the tree for a given input.

- **Prediction:**
  - Returns `1` if the model predicts the patient **has Heart Disease**.
  - Returns `0` if the model predicts the patient **does not have Heart Disease**.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a patient's data:

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',            # Not used in the tree
    'chest_pain': 0,          # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,          # Not used in the tree
    'chol': 250,              # Not used in the tree
    'fbs': 1,                 # Not used in the tree
    'restecg': 2,             # Not used in the tree
    'thalach': 130,           # Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
    'exang': 1,               # No Exercise Induced Angina
    'oldpeak': 1.0,           # Not used in the tree
    'slope': 2,               # Not used in the tree
    'ca': 1,                  # Number of Major Vessels
    'thal': 2                 # Not used in the tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Heart Disease
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1` (Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic)
  - `nodes[1] = 1` (Number of Major Vessels > 0.5)

- **Outcome:**
  - The model predicts that the patient **has Heart Disease**.

**Note:** In this decision tree, the most critical factor is the **Chest Pain Type**. If it's **Asymptomatic**, the patient is immediately classified as having heart disease. If not, the model looks at **Exercise Induced Angina** and **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved** to make the prediction.
