Certainly! Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, using the specified feature keys and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Exercise Induced Angina == No (exang == 1)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['exang'] == 1 else 0  # 1 = No, 2 = Yes
    
    # Node 1: Check if ST Depression Induced by Exercise <= 1.0 (oldpeak <= 1.0)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0 else 0  # Range: 0 to 5

    if nodes[0]:  # Exercise Induced Angina == No
        if nodes[1]:  # ST Depression <= 1.0
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # ST Depression > 1.0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
    else:  # Exercise Induced Angina == Yes
        prediction = 1  # Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Inputs:**
  - `X`: A dictionary containing the patient's features with exact keys as specified.

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the first inner node.
    - **Condition:** `X['exang'] == 1` (Exercise Induced Angina is **No**)
    - **Encoding:** `exang` (1 = No, 2 = Yes)
    - **Value:** `1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the second inner node.
    - **Condition:** `X['oldpeak'] <= 1.0` (ST Depression ≤ 1.0)
    - **Range:** `oldpeak` (0 to 5)
    - **Value:** `1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **First Check (`nodes[0]`):** Is Exercise Induced Angina **No**?
    - **Yes (`nodes[0] == 1`):**
      - **Second Check (`nodes[1]`):** Is ST Depression ≤ 1.0?
        - **Yes (`nodes[1] == 1`):** Predict **No Heart Disease** (`prediction = 0`)
        - **No (`nodes[1] == 0`):** Predict **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`)
    - **No (`nodes[0] == 0`):** Predict **Heart Disease** (`prediction = 1`)

- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values `[nodes[0], nodes[1]]`

### **Usage Example:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient = {
    'age': 54,
    'sex': 'male',                # Note: Ensure correct encoding if needed
    'chest_pain': 0,
    'trestbps': 130,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,                   # 1 = No Exercise Induced Angina
    'oldpeak': 0.5,               # ST Depression
    'slope': 2,
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### **Notes:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Ensure that all feature values in `X` are encoded as per the specified encodings.
    - For `exang`:
      - `1` = No Exercise Induced Angina
      - `2` = Yes Exercise Induced Angina
    - For `oldpeak`:
      - Floating-point value between `0` and `5`.

- **Feature Values:**
  - If features like `sex`, `chest_pain`, etc., are provided as strings or require encoding, convert them to the appropriate numerical values before using the `predict` function.

- **Function Adjustments:**
  - The function assumes that the input `X` has all necessary features with correct keys and encodings.
  - Modify or extend the function if additional preprocessing or error handling is needed.

### **Summary:**

- The function `predict` implements the decision tree classifier.
- It returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class label.
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values indicating which path was taken in the tree.
- The decision logic is based on the most significant features for predicting heart disease in this context:
  - **Exercise Induced Angina** (`exang`)
  - **ST Depression Induced by Exercise** (`oldpeak`)

### **In the Context of the Decision Tree:**

The decision tree can be represented as:

```
|--- exang == 1 (Exercise Induced Angina == No)
     |--- oldpeak <= 1.0
          |--- Prediction: 0 (No Heart Disease)
     |--- oldpeak > 1.0
          |--- Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
|--- exang != 1 (Exercise Induced Angina == Yes)
     |--- Prediction: 1 (Heart Disease)
```

- **Node Conditions Correspond to:**
  - `nodes[0]`: `exang == 1`
  - `nodes[1]`: `oldpeak <= 1.0`

---

### **Function Testing:**

You can test the function with different patient data to see how the prediction and nodes change.

#### **Test Case 1:**

Patient without exercise-induced angina and low ST depression.

```python
patient1 = {
    'exang': 1,        # No Exercise Induced Angina
    'oldpeak': 0.5     # ST Depression <= 1.0
    # Other features can be included as needed
}

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(patient1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [1, 1]
```

#### **Test Case 2:**

Patient without exercise-induced angina but high ST depression.

```python
patient2 = {
    'exang': 1,        # No Exercise Induced Angina
    'oldpeak': 2.0     # ST Depression > 1.0
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(patient2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}, Nodes: {nodes2}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [1, 0]
```

#### **Test Case 3:**

Patient with exercise-induced angina.

```python
patient3 = {
    'exang': 2,        # Yes Exercise Induced Angina
    'oldpeak': 0.5     # ST Depression (value doesn't affect the outcome in this branch)
}

prediction3, nodes3 = predict(patient3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction3}, Nodes: {nodes3}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0, 1]
```

### **Conclusion:**

- The function adheres to your specifications and examples.
- It correctly implements the decision tree logic for predicting heart disease based on the most important features.
- The `nodes` list provides traceability of the decisions made at each node.
