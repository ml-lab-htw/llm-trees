def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = int(X['ca'] <= 0)
    nodes[1] = int(X['chest_pain'] == 0)  # Asymptomatic (encoded as 0)
    nodes[2] = int(X['exang'] == 2)       # Yes (encoded as 2)
    nodes[3] = int(X['slope'] == 2)       # Flat (encoded as 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** checks if the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (`ca`) is less than or equal to 0.
  ```python
  nodes[0] = int(X['ca'] <= 0)
  ```
  
- **Node 1** checks if the chest pain type (`chest_pain`) is "Asymptomatic", which is encoded as `0`.
  ```python
  nodes[1] = int(X['chest_pain'] == 0)
  ```
  
- **Node 2** checks if exercise-induced angina (`exang`) is "Yes", which is encoded as `2`.
  ```python
  nodes[2] = int(X['exang'] == 2)
  ```
  
- **Node 3** checks if the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (`slope`) is "Flat", which is encoded as `2`.
  ```python
  nodes[3] = int(X['slope'] == 2)
  ```

The decision logic follows the decision tree structure you provided:

- If **Node 0** is `True` (1), meaning `ca <= 0`:
  - If **Node 1** is `True` (1), meaning `chest_pain` is "Asymptomatic":
    - Predict `1` (Heart Disease).
  - Else:
    - Predict `0` (No Heart Disease).
- Else:
  - If **Node 2** is `True` (1), meaning `exang` is "Yes":
    - Predict `1` (Heart Disease).
  - Else:
    - If **Node 3** is `True` (1), meaning `slope` is "Flat":
      - Predict `1` (Heart Disease).
    - Else:
      - Predict `0` (No Heart Disease).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,  # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,
    'restecg': 2,
    'thalach': 150,
    'exang': 1,       # No
    'oldpeak': 1.0,
    'slope': 2,       # Flat
    'ca': 0,
    'thal': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Heart Disease
Nodes: [1, 1, 0, 1]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with proper encoding as specified. The function will return a prediction (`0` or `1`) and a list `nodes` indicating which conditions were met (`1`) or not met (`0`).
