The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing feature values and returns a prediction (`1` for heart disease, `0` for no heart disease) along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry in `nodes` is `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 5  # List to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic (encoded as 0)
    nodes[0] = int(X["chest_pain"] == 0)

    # Node 1: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy > 0
    nodes[1] = int(X["ca"] > 0)

    # Node 2: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest > 1.0
    nodes[2] = int(X["oldpeak"] > 1.0)

    # Node 3: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 140 bpm
    nodes[3] = int(X["thalach"] > 140)

    # Node 4: Exercise Induced Angina is Yes (encoded as 2)
    nodes[4] = int(X["exang"] == 2)

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If Chest Pain Type is Asymptomatic
        if nodes[1]:  # If Number of Major Vessels > 0
            prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
        else:  # Number of Major Vessels = 0
            if nodes[2]:  # If ST Depression > 1.0
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # ST Depression <= 1.0
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
    else:  # Chest Pain Type is not Asymptomatic
        if nodes[3]:  # If Maximum Heart Rate Achieved > 140 bpm
            prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease
        else:  # Maximum Heart Rate <= 140 bpm
            if nodes[4]:  # If Exercise Induced Angina is Yes
                prediction = 1  # Heart Disease
            else:  # Exercise Induced Angina is No
                prediction = 0  # No Heart Disease

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys and Encodings Used:**
  - `chest_pain`: Chest Pain Type (0 = Asymptomatic, 1 = Atypical angina, 2 = Non-anginal pain, 3 = Typical angina)
  - `ca`: Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0, 1, 2, 3)
  - `oldpeak`: ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (Value from 0 to 5)
  - `thalach`: Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm)
  - `exang`: Exercise Induced Angina (1 = No, 2 = Yes)

- **Node Conditions:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the chest pain type is **Asymptomatic** (`X["chest_pain"] == 0`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the number of major vessels colored (`ca`) is greater than 0 (`X["ca"] > 0`).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if ST depression induced by exercise (`oldpeak`) is greater than 1.0 (`X["oldpeak"] > 1.0`).
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`) is greater than 140 bpm (`X["thalach"] > 140`).
  - `nodes[4]`: Checks if exercise-induced angina (`exang`) is **Yes** (`X["exang"] == 2`).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If the patient has Asymptomatic chest pain (`nodes[0] == 1`):**
    - **And** the number of major vessels colored is greater than 0 (`nodes[1] == 1`), the patient is predicted to have **Heart Disease**.
    - **Else**, if ST depression is greater than 1.0 (`nodes[2] == 1`), the patient is predicted to have **Heart Disease**.
    - **Else**, the patient is predicted to have **No Heart Disease**.
  - **Else**, if the maximum heart rate achieved is greater than 140 bpm (`nodes[3] == 1`), the patient is predicted to have **No Heart Disease**.
    - **Else**, if exercise-induced angina is **Yes** (`nodes[4] == 1`), the patient is predicted to have **Heart Disease**.
    - **Else**, the patient is predicted to have **No Heart Disease**.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a patient with the following data:

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 55,
    'sex': 'male',
    'chest_pain': 0,      # Asymptomatic
    'trestbps': 140,
    'chol': 250,
    'fbs': 1,             # False
    'restecg': 2,         # Normal
    'thalach': 130,
    'exang': 1,           # No
    'oldpeak': 2.3,
    'slope': 2,           # Flat
    'ca': 1,
    'thal': 3             # Reversible defect
}
```

Predicting using the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", "Heart Disease" if prediction == 1 else "No Heart Disease")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Heart Disease
Nodes: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 1`: Chest pain is Asymptomatic.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: Number of major vessels colored (`ca`) is greater than 0.
- Since `nodes[1]` is `1`, the function predicts **Heart Disease** without evaluating further nodes.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values as per the feature descriptions and encodings provided.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree structure with a maximum depth of 4, using the most significant features to make the prediction.
