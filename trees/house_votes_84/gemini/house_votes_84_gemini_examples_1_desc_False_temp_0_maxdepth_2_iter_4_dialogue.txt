def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Hypothetical important features and thresholds
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] > 1.5  # Vote YES on Contra Aid
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] > 1.5 # Vote YES on Physician Fee Freeze


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted Yes on Contra Aid (Likely Republican)
        if nodes[1]: # Voted Yes on Fee Freeze (Less likely Republican)
            prediction = 1 # Republican - Still leaning Republican due to Contra aid vote
        else: # Voted No on Fee Freeze (More likely Republican)
            prediction = 1 # Republican
    else:  # Voted No on Contra Aid (Likely Democrat)
        if nodes[1]: # Voted yes on fee freeze (Less Likely Republican)
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else: # Voted no on fee freeze (More Likely Republican)
            prediction = 1 # Republican - This combination could swing either way


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've used 1.5 as the threshold for both features. Since the votes are encoded as 2 for yes and 1 for no, this effectively checks if the vote was "yes."
* **Feature Importance:**  Remember, this is still based on a *hypothetical* feature importance. With real data, you would use a library like scikit-learn to train a decision tree and determine the actual important features and optimal thresholds.
* **Depth 2 Limitation:**  The provided structure strictly adheres to a depth of 2.  A deeper tree might be more accurate with this data, but would require more complex logic in the function.
* **Handling Missing Data:**  The current function doesn't handle missing values. In real-world scenarios, you'd need to add checks for missing data (e.g., using `if X['feature_name'] is not None:`) and implement strategies for imputation or alternative logic.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,  #yes
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, # no
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2, #yes
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1, # no
    'el-salvador-adi': 2, # yes
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2, #yes
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1, #no
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2, #yes
    'mx-missile': 1, #no
    'immigration': 2, # yes
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1, # no
    'education-spending': 1, #no
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2, #yes
    'crime': 2, #yes
    'duty-free-exports': 1, #no
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2 #yes
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): {prediction}")
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")
```

This will output the predicted party and the truth values of the inner nodes based on the example voter's data and the hypothetical decision tree logic.  To make this a real decision tree, replace the placeholder logic with logic derived from training on actual voting data.
