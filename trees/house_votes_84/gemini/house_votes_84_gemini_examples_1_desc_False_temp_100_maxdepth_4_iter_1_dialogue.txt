```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Adjusted for 3 inner nodes

    # Using 2 for 'yes' and 1 for 'no', aligning with provided encoding
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: yes
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2      # Education spending: yes
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2 # Aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes

    if nodes[0]:  # Physician fee freeze: yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Education spending: yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:           # Education spending: no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:           # Physician fee freeze: no
        if nodes[2]:  # Aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:           # Aid to Nicaraguan contras: no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:**  The code now correctly uses the provided encoding (2 for 'yes', 1 for 'no') for the voting features.
* **Simplified Logic:** The nested `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to read and understand.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names (e.g., `nodes[0]` representing the "physician-fee-freeze" vote) enhance readability.
* **Reduced Number of Nodes:** The `nodes` list has been adjusted to 3 elements, reflecting the three inner nodes in the decision tree.
* **Target Encoding:** The prediction now aligns with the target encoding (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [True, True, False]
```


This improved function accurately implements the hypothetical decision tree logic and provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes. Remember that this tree's effectiveness depends on the validity of the underlying assumptions about the relationship between votes and party affiliation.  Real-world data is essential for building a robust and accurate classifier.
