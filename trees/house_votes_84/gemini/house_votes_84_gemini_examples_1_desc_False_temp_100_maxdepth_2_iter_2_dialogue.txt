```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Vote yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Vote yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1 # Republican (likely, based on hypothetical importance)
        else: # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0 # Democrat (potentially, adds nuance to the freeze vote)
    else: # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0 # Democrat (more likely if against fee freeze)

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Feature Selection (Hypothetical):** We're *assuming* (as before, without real data) that 'physician-fee-freeze' and 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' are the most important features.  In a real application, you would determine this through feature importance analysis after training a model.

2. **Thresholds:** We use `== 2` as the condition because the votes are encoded as 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".

3. **Tree Structure (Depth 2):** The `if/else` structure mirrors the decision tree logic.  The first split is based on 'physician-fee-freeze', and the second split (within the first `if` block) is on 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'.

4. **Predictions (Hypothetical):**  The assigned predictions (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) are based on the *assumed* relationships between these votes and party affiliation.  With real data, a trained model would determine these relationships more accurately.

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which are equivalent to 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node. This allows you to track which path was taken through the tree for a given input.


**Important Note:**  This function is a *demonstration* of how to structure a decision tree prediction function in Python.  The accuracy of the predictions relies entirely on the *assumed* feature importance and relationships, which are placeholders for real data analysis.  To build a useful model, you *must* train a decision tree classifier on a labeled dataset using a library like scikit-learn.
