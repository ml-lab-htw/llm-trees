**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` List:**  This list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each inner node. Since we have a maximum depth of 2, we initialize it with two `None` values.

2. **Feature Selection (Placeholder):**  The code currently assumes that "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" and "education-spending" are the most important features. This is based on the simplified example from before.  *You'll need to replace these with the actual most important features determined from data analysis.*

3. **Thresholds:** I've used a threshold of `2` (meaning "yes" vote) for both features.  *Again, these are placeholders.  The actual thresholds might be different based on the data and how well the votes separate Democrats and Republicans.*

4. **Decision Logic:** The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision logic of the tree, mirroring the structure described in my previous response.

**Important:**

* **Data-Driven:** This function needs to be used with a dataset that includes the voting records (features) and party affiliations (target) to be meaningful.
* **Feature Importance:** Before using this function, you **must** analyze the data to determine the actual most important features and potentially adjust thresholds based on data patterns. 

Please provide the dataset, and I can help you determine the most important features and create a more accurate decision tree function!
