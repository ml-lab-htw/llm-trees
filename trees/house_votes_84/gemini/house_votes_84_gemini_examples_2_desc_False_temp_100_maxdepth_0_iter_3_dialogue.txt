I still can't create a truly accurate decision tree without training data. However, I can provide a Python function based on the *conceptual example* I gave previously, incorporating the provided feature names and encoding.  Remember, this is a *demonstration* and likely not representative of a real-world model trained on voting data.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Using 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' as the primary split
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # 2 represents "yes"

    # Using 'physician-fee-freeze' as the secondary split
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # 2 represents "yes"

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
            prediction = 1  # Republican (adjusting the example for demonstration)
        else:  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (replace with actual feature values):
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (Democrat in this example)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")      # Output: [False, False]
```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Feature names:** Uses the correct feature names from your specification.
* **Encoding:**  Handles the "2=yes, 1=no" encoding correctly.
* **Pythonic function:** Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

**To reiterate:**  This is a *simplified demonstration*.  A real-world model would need to be trained on actual data and would likely be much more complex. Provide a dataset with voting records and party affiliations, and I can help you create a properly trained decision tree classifier.
