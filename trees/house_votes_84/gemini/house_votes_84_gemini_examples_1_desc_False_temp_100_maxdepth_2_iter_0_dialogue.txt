def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Physician Fee Freeze (yes=2)
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Aid to Nicaraguan Contras (yes=2)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican (potentially more moderate)
    else:
        if X['education-spending'] == 2:  # Education Spending (yes=2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat (potentially more fiscally conservative)

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function directly implements the illustrative decision tree from the previous response, using the correct feature names and encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no, and 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat). The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the inner node conditions.  Remember that this tree is based on assumptions and not trained on real data.  The actual tree structure and feature importance would be different with real-world training.
