```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None] # Only 2 inner nodes in a depth 3 tree with this structure


    # Hypothetical thresholds â€“ replace with data-driven values if you have training data
    nodes[0] = X['handicapped-infants'] == 2  # Voted yes on handicapped infants
    nodes[1] = X['water-project-cost-sharing'] == 2 # Voted yes on water project


    if nodes[0]: #voted yes on handicapped infants
        if nodes[1]: # voted yes on water project cost sharing
            prediction = 1 # Likely Republican
        else: #voted no on water project cost sharing
            prediction = 0 # Likely Democrat
    else: #voted no on handicapped infants
        if X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2: # Voted yes on budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat
        else:#voted no on budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The code directly uses the provided feature encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no).
2. **Thresholds:**  I've filled in the placeholder thresholds with assumptions based on common US political stances.  However, *these are just hypothetical examples.*  You would need real data and a training process to determine appropriate and effective splits.
3. **Number of Nodes:** A depth-3 tree with this structure (as laid out in the previous responses) only has *two* internal decision nodes. The `nodes` list is initialized accordingly.
4. **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure more clearly mirrors the decision tree logic.
5. **Target Encoding:** The function returns 1 for Republican and 0 for Democrat, following the provided target encoding.

**How to use with real data and training:**

You would replace the hypothetical thresholds and branching logic with the output of a decision tree training algorithm (like scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`).  The trained model would give you the actual features to split on, the threshold values, and the class predictions at the leaf nodes. You would then embed this trained logic into the `predict` function.  This way, the function would use the learned decision boundaries instead of the placeholder values.


Example usage (with made-up data):

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2, 
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, 
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}") # Output: 0 (Democrat in this example)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Example: [1, 0] (True, False)
```
