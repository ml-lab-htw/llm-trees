```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on voting record (hypothetical tree).

    Args:
        X: A dictionary of voting records, where keys are feature names 
           and values are 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
        and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Contra aid: yes (2)
    nodes[1] = X['education-spending'] == 2        # Education spending: yes (2)

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on Contra aid
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Voted no on Contra aid
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1 # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Correct Feature Names and Values:** The code now uses the exact feature names provided (e.g., 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 'education-spending') and the correct mapping of 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic outlined in the previous response.
* **Docstring:**  A docstring explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return values, improving readability and maintainability.
* **Return Format:** The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list as a tuple, as requested.

**Example Usage:**

```python
voter_profile = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    # ... other votes ...
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    # ... other votes
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voter_profile)
print(f"Predicted party: {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")

```


This function embodies the *hypothetical* decision tree.  Remember, with real-world data, you would use a machine learning library to train a decision tree and obtain a much more accurate and robust model. This function is solely for demonstrating the code structure based on the hypothetical example.
