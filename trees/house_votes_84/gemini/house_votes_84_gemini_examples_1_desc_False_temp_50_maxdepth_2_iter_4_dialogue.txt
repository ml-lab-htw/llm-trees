def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 1 # Democrat more likely to oppose (vote 'no' = 1)
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Republican more likely to support (vote 'yes' = 2)


    if nodes[0]:  # If voted against physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0 # Democrat
    else: # If voted for physician fee freeze or abstained
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted for aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else: # If voted against aid to Nicaraguan contras or abstained
            prediction = 0 # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that a "yes" vote is encoded as 2 and a "no" vote as 1. The function now correctly uses these encodings.

2. **Meaningful Thresholds:** The original placeholder thresholds have been replaced with logical conditions based on the assumed political leanings related to the selected features ("physician-fee-freeze" and "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"). Democrats were more likely to oppose the physician fee freeze, while Republicans were more likely to support aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.

3. **Handling Abstentions/Missing Data:**  While the provided data encoding doesn't explicitly mention abstentions, a real-world dataset might have missing values or abstentions.  The current logic assumes that abstentions (or any value other than the specified "yes" or "no" codes) are treated as leaning towards the opposite party for that particular branch of the tree.  A more robust solution would handle missing data explicitly, perhaps by assigning it to the majority class at that node or using more sophisticated imputation techniques.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    # ... other votes
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # Voted 'no'
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,  # Voted 'yes'
    # ... other votes
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (Democrat - initially predicts 0 but then overridden by second condition)
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")  # Output: [True, True]
```


Remember, this is still a simplified example. A real-world model would require training on a substantial dataset and likely benefit from more complex decision boundaries, potentially using more features and a greater depth.  Using a machine learning library is the recommended approach for building robust decision tree classifiers.
