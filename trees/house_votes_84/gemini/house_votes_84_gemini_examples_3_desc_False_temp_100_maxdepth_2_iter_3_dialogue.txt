I understand now! You want a Python function representing a decision tree trained on voting data to predict party affiliation, along with a list tracking the truth values of inner nodes. 

**Since you haven't provided the actual voting data to determine feature importance and thresholds, I'll create a sample decision tree function. This example will use plausible features but won't reflect actual relationships in voting patterns.**

```python
def predict_party(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary of votes, with keys from the feature list.
           Values are 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".

  Returns:
    A tuple: (prediction, nodes)
      - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
      - nodes: List of truth values (1/0) for inner nodes
  """

  nodes = 2 * [None]  

  # Example decision tree structure (depth 2)
  nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Voted "yes"
  nodes[1] = X['religious-groups-in-schools'] == 2

  if nodes[0]:  # If voted "yes" on aid to contras
    if nodes[1]:  # Also voted "yes" on religious groups in schools
      prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Less certain, but leaning Democrat
  else:  # Voted "no" on aid to contras
    prediction = 0  # More likely Democrat

  return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
vote_record = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2, 
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, 
    # ... other votes ...
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    # ... remaining votes ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party(vote_record)
print(f"Predicted party: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_party(X)`:**
   - Takes a `X` dictionary as input (keys are feature names, values are vote encodings).
   - Initializes `nodes` list to store truth values.

2. **Decision Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2`: Checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras was "yes" (2).
   - `nodes[1] = X['religious-groups-in-schools'] == 2`: Checks the vote on religious groups in schools similarly.

3. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The `if/else` structure implements the decision tree's branches, assigning a prediction based on the truth values of `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. Building a real decision tree requires labeled voting data and a training process to determine the optimal features and thresholds for splitting.
