**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (1.5 in the example) are used to convert the 1/2 coding for yes/no to a boolean decision.  A value > 1.5 effectively means they voted "yes".
* **Feature Selection:** I've used "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" and "education-spending" based on the previous hypothetical example.  However, with real data, feature importance should be determined through the training process of a `DecisionTreeClassifier`.
* **Data Encoding:** The code correctly handles the 2/1 encoding of the features.
* **Testability:**  The function is now easily testable with different voter profiles.

**To make this truly effective, you *must* train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` on real data.**  The provided code is a structural example implementing the required format, but the feature selection and thresholds should be data-driven.
