```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 represents "yes"

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```


This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single data point (a set of votes) as input.  It checks the vote on the "physician-fee-freeze" issue.  If the vote is "yes" (represented by 2), it predicts Republican (1). Otherwise, it predicts Democrat (0). It also returns a list `nodes` where `nodes[0]` stores the truth value (1 if the condition is met, 0 otherwise) of the split condition.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Voting yes on physician fee freeze
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True]


example_vote2 = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # Voting no on physician fee freeze
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False]
```


Remember that this is a simplified example and a real-world model would require training on a dataset and potentially have a greater depth than 1 for better accuracy.
