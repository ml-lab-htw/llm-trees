```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Vote yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Vote yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]: # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:        # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:        # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if X['education-spending'] == 2:    # Voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else:        # Voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes

```



**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Feature Access:** The code now uses the correct feature names from the provided list (e.g., `X['physician-fee-freeze']`).
2. **Encoding Handling:** The code explicitly checks for the "yes" vote using `== 2`, aligning with the provided encoding.
3. **Simplified Logic:** The nested `if` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. **Reduced Node List:**  The `nodes` list now only includes the nodes actually used in the decision-making process, making it more efficient.


**Example Usage:**


```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,  # Yes to contras
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted Party: {prediction} (1=Republican, 0=Democrat)")  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Node Values: {nodes}")  # Output: [True, True]



example_voter2 = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # No to fee freeze
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2, 
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2, # Yes to education spending
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter2)
print(f"Predicted Party: {prediction} (1=Republican, 0=Democrat)")  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Node Values: {nodes}")  # Output: [False, True]

```


This revised code provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree, correctly handling feature access and encoding, and providing a clear output for both the prediction and the internal node evaluations. Remember that this decision tree is still hypothetical. A real-world application would require training a model on actual data.
