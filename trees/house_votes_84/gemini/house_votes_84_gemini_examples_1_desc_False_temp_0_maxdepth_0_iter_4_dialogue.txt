```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Physician fee freeze vote (using 2 for yes, 1 for no)
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        # Aid to Nicaraguan Contras vote
        nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Education spending vote
        nodes[1] = X['education-spending'] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Access:** The code now correctly accesses the features using the provided keys (e.g., `X['physician-fee-freeze']`).
* **Correct Encoding:**  The code explicitly checks for the values `2` (yes) and `1` (no) as specified in the feature descriptions.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The tree structure is maintained, but the code is simplified to make it more readable.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds are now implicitly defined by the vote values (2 for yes, 1 for no). This directly reflects the decision logic based on the votes.
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes, as requested.


**Example Usage:**


```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```


This example shows how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.  The `nodes` list shows that both inner node conditions were met (both `True`), leading to the prediction of Republican.  Remember, this is a *simplified* example.  A real decision tree would likely be more complex and based on a trained model.
