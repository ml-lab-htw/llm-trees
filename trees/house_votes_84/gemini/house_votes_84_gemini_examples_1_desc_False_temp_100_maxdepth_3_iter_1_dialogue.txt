```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Only two inner nodes in depth 3 tree

    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]: # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else: # Voted no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1 # Republican (Likely, but allowing for some variance)
    else:  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if X['education-spending'] == 2:  # yes on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican (Potentially)
        else: # no on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions indicate that "yes" votes are encoded as 2, and "no" votes as 1.  The code now reflects this correctly.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list is initialized with two `None` values, corresponding to the two decision nodes in our depth-3 tree. The list is populated with boolean values representing the truth of each condition.
* **Clearer Conditions:** The conditions within the `if/else` structure are now more explicit, using `== 2` to check for "yes" votes and directly relating to the feature names and their encoded values.
* **Republican/Democrat Alignment:** The prediction at each leaf node (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) aligns with our initial assumptions.
* **Reduced Complexity:** The original example attempted to use three inner nodes where only two were necessary for our simplified depth-3 tree. This has been corrected for greater accuracy and efficiency.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```


This refined function provides a more accurate implementation of the simplified decision tree logic described earlier while also providing the requested `nodes` list. Remember that this is still a simplified example and a real-world scenario would require a more data-driven approach.
