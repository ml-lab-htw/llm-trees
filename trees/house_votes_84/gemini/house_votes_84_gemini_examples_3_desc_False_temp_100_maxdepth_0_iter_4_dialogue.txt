def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Vote yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Vote yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I've chosen 'physician-fee-freeze' and 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' as the splitting features.  These were used in my earlier conceptual example and are often cited as being important in distinguishing voting patterns of Democrats and Republicans historically (although the political landscape can shift).

2. **Thresholds:** Since the votes are encoded as 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no", the thresholds are set to `== 2` to check for a "yes" vote.

3. **Tree Structure:** The `if/else` structure implements the decision tree logic described previously:

   - A "yes" vote on the physician fee freeze and a "yes" vote on Contra aid likely indicates a Republican.
   - A "no" vote on the fee freeze and a "yes" vote on Contra aid likely indicates a Democrat.
   - And so on...

4. **`nodes` List:**  The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at each inner node. This allows for inspection of the decision path.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, False]
```

**Important Note:** This is a *simplified* example.  A real-world decision tree would likely be more complex, use more features, and be trained on a large dataset of actual voting records to achieve better accuracy.  The choice of features and thresholds would be data-driven, using feature selection techniques and potentially more sophisticated splitting criteria.
