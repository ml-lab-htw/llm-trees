```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] <= 1  # No on Physician Fee Freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] <= 1  # No on Aid to Nicaraguan Contras
    nodes[2] = X['education-spending'] <= 1  # No on Education Spending


    if nodes[0]:  # No on Physician Fee Freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # No on Aid to Nicaraguan Contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Yes on Aid to Nicaraguan Contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Yes on Physician Fee Freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # No on Education Spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Yes on Education Spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions use 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no." The code now correctly uses `<= 1` to check for a "no" vote.

2. **Clearer Node Logic:** The `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree's branches, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Target Encoding:** The function returns 0 for Democrat and 1 for Republican, matching the specified target encoding.

4. **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds are now based on the yes/no vote encoding.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted party: 0 (Democrat)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")  # Output: Node truth values: [True, True, False]

```


This example demonstrates how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.  Remember that this decision tree is hypothetical; a real-world model would need to be trained on actual data.
