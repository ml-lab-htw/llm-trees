**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with conditions related to key votes that are often aligned with party lines (e.g., physician fee freeze, aid to Nicaraguan contras, budget resolution, MX missile, and aid to El Salvador). These are just examples. Analyzing the actual data would help identify the most discriminatory features and thresholds.
* **Republican/Democrat Logic:** The nested `if/else` structure reflects the assumption that certain combinations of votes are more indicative of one party or the other.  For example, voting yes on physician fee freeze, aid to Nicaraguan contras, and the budget resolution is more likely to be a Republican stance.
* **Depth 5:** The tree structure uses a depth of 5 as requested, with nested conditions.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at each inner node, which is useful for understanding the path taken through the tree.


**How to Use with Data:**

You would call the `predict` function with a dictionary representing a single data point.  For example:

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party: {prediction}")  # 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") 
```


This improved version provides a more realistic and interpretable decision tree function, although it's still crucial to remember that the best tree structure and thresholds will depend on the specific data you are using. You should train a decision tree model on your data to find the optimal decision boundaries.
