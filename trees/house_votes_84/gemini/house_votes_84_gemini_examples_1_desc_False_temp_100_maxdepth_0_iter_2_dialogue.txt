```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Vote yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Vote yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if X['education-spending'] == 2: # Vote yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes

```

This Python function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree structure discussed earlier. It takes a dictionary `X` representing a single voting record as input.  The keys of the dictionary correspond to the feature names (vote topics). The values represent the vote (2 for yes, 1 for no).


The function returns the predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list `nodes` containing the truth values of the decision nodes. For example, if `nodes[0]` is `True`, it means the condition `X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2` was met.

Remember: This function is based on a *hypothetical* relationship between votes and party affiliation. To create a truly predictive model, you would need to train a decision tree algorithm on real-world data.
