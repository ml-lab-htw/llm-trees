**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Feature Encoding:**  The code directly uses the feature encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no) in the conditions.
2. **Simplified Structure:**  The nested `if/else` structure reflects the decision tree logic more directly, making it easier to read and understand.
3. **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds are now based on the vote (yes/no), which is the natural decision point in this dataset.
4. **Target Encoding Alignment:** The function returns 0 for Democrat and 1 for Republican, consistent with the provided target encoding.
5. **Reduced Tree Depth:** This simplified tree uses only three key votes, which is often sufficient for a reasonable initial classification in this domain.  A more complex tree could be built if desired, but this keeps the example clear.
6. **Node List:** The `nodes` list accurately tracks the truth values of the conditions.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2, 'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1, 'el-salvador-adi': 2, 'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1, 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2, 'mx-missile': 2, 'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1, 'education-spending': 1, 'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2, 'duty-free-exports': 1, 'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted Party: {prediction}")  # Output: Predicted Party: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") # Output: Node Truth Values: [False, True, True]
```


This improved function provides a more accurate and interpretable implementation of the decision tree logic for the Congressional Voting Records dataset.  Remember that without training data, this remains a simplified example and a real-world application would require a more sophisticated approach using machine learning libraries.
