```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Using physician-fee-freeze and aid-to-nicaraguan-contras as key features
    # Recall: 2 = yes, 1 = no in the data
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Splitting on voting "no" (1) or "yes" (2)
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5  # Splitting on voting "no" (1) or "yes" (2)

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted no or abstention on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted no or abstention on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat (based on our *assumed* relationships)
        else:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
    else:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted no or abstention on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat
        else:  # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:** The code now uses 1.5 as the threshold for the vote features.  This handles the "yes" (2), "no" (1) encoding, treating values less than or equal to 1.5 as effectively "no" or an abstention.

2. **Feature Importance:** Remember that the choice of "physician-fee-freeze" and "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" as the most important features is a *placeholder*. In a real application, you would use feature importance from a trained decision tree model to select the best features.

3. **Data Encoding:** The code assumes the votes are encoded as 1 for "no" and 2 for "yes". Make sure this matches your actual data encoding.

4. **Training:** To build a truly effective model, you *must* train a decision tree classifier on a labeled dataset of votes and party affiliations.  This example provides the function structure but not the learned logic from data.  Use libraries like scikit-learn in Python to train decision tree models:

   ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   # ... load and preprocess your data (X, y) ...
   clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2)  # Set max_depth
   clf.fit(X, y)  # Train the model

   # Then, you can use clf.predict(new_data) for predictions.
   ```


This improved version gives you a working function and clarifies how to build a real decision tree model.  The key is to use a training dataset and a machine learning algorithm to determine the optimal features and splits.
