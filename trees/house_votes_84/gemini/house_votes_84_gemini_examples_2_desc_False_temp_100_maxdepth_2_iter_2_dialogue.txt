You got it! Here's a Python function representing a decision tree for predicting party affiliation based on voting records.  I've chosen 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' and 'physician-fee-freeze' as the splitting features based on general political knowledge. You'll likely need real data and a feature importance calculation to determine the most accurate features and thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

  Args:
      X (dict): A dictionary of features representing a single voting record.
          Features should include:
              'handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing',
              'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', 'physician-fee-freeze',
              'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools',
              'anti-satellite-test-ban', 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras',
              'mx-missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels-corporation-cutback',
              'education-spending', 'superfund-right-to-sue', 'crime',
              'duty-free-exports', 'export-administration-act-south-africa'

  Returns:
      tuple: A tuple containing the predicted party affiliation (1=Republican, 0=Democrat)
              and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

  nodes = 2 * [None]

  # Hypothetical split:
  #   Voting yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras likely indicates Republican
  nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2

  # Hypothetical split:
  #   Voting yes on the physician fee freeze likely indicates Republican
  nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2

  if nodes[0]:  # Supported aid to Nicaraguan contras
      prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
  else:
      if nodes[1]:  # Supported physician fee freeze
          prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
      else:
          prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat

  return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
vote_record = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(vote_record)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1=Republican, 0=Democrat)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the voting record features.
2. **Nodes:** The `nodes` list will store the truth values (True/False) of conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. We initialize it with two `None` values as our tree has a maximum depth of 2.
3. **Feature Splits:**
    - `nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2`: This represents the first split in the tree. We check if the vote on 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' is 2 (yes).
    - `nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2`: If the first condition is false (didn't vote yes on Nicaraguan contras), we check if the vote on 'physician-fee-freeze' is 2 (yes).
4. **Predictions:**
    - If `nodes[0]` is True (voted yes on Nicaraguan contras), we predict Republican (`prediction = 1`).
    - If `nodes[0]` is False, we move to the second condition (`nodes[1]`). If True (voted yes on physician fee freeze), we predict Republican.
    - If both conditions are False, we predict Democrat (`prediction = 0`).
5. **Return:** The function returns the `prediction` and the `nodes` list.

**Remember:** You'll need to replace the placeholder features and thresholds with those determined from analyzing your actual voting data.  You can use libraries like scikit-learn to calculate feature importance and build more robust decision trees.
