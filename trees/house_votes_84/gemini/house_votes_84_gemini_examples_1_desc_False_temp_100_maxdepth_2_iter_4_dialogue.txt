```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Contras aid: yes (2)
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: yes (2)


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Republican (Fiscal conservative?)
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```


This function implements the hypothetical decision tree discussed earlier, using the correct feature names and encoding (2 for "yes," 1 for "no," and 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).  The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the decision nodes, as requested.

Remember, this tree is *not* trained on real data and is for illustrative purposes.  The choices of "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" and "physician-fee-freeze" as the key features and the specific split logic are based on general political assumptions, *not* data analysis.  For a real-world application, you'd train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn on actual data to get a meaningful and accurate model.
