You are still mixing up the Iris dataset (petal length, sepal width) with the Congressional voting dataset. The examples you provided use Iris features, but you want a function for predicting party affiliation based on voting records.  Since you haven't provided *any* voting data, I'll create a plausible decision tree based on common political positions. This is a **hypothetical example** and its accuracy on real-world data is unknown.


```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on voting record (hypothetical example).

    Args:
        X: A dictionary of voting records, where keys are feature names
           (as specified in the prompt) and values are 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
        and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2 # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # Voted yes on MX missile


    if nodes[0]:  # Favors physician fee freeze (generally Republican)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else: # Opposes or didn't vote on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]: # Favors aid to Nicaraguan contras (generally Republican)
            prediction = 1 # Republican
        else: # Opposes or didn't vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            if nodes[2]: # Favors MX missile (generally Republican)
                prediction = 1 # Republican
            else:  # Opposes or didn't vote on MX missile (leaning Democrat)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat


    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (replace with actual voting data):
example_vote = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1,
}


prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* This example tree uses three votes as decision points.  This is a simplification.  A real-world decision tree would likely be more complex and involve more features.
*  The choice of "physician-fee-freeze," "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras," and "mx-missile" as important features is based on general political alignments of the time (assuming the data is from the 1980s, based on the features provided).  **With real data, feature importance would be determined through the decision tree learning process.**
* The encoding of 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no" is used consistently as per your instructions.
* The `nodes` list reflects the truth values of the conditions at each inner node. This is useful for understanding the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.

To build a meaningful decision tree, you *must* provide the actual voting data.  Once you do, I can help you create a much more accurate and relevant model.
