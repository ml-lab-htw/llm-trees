**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Feature Access:**  Accesses features using the correct keys from the provided list (e.g., `X['physician-fee-freeze']`).
2. **Meaningful Thresholds:** Uses `== 1` to check for a "yes" vote (since 2 represents "yes").  This replaces the arbitrary 0.5 threshold, making the logic more directly related to the vote.
3. **Simplified Branching:**  Simplified the nested `if/else` structure to make it more readable.
4. **Consistent Return:** Returns the `prediction` and the `nodes` list as required.
5. **Aligned with Hypothetical Logic:** The decision logic is consistent with the previously described hypothetical tree based on political stances.

**How to Use:**

```python
example_vote = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1, # No
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,   #Yes
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Predicted party: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (if the individual votes yes to physician-fee-freeze and education-spending )
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True, None]
```


**Important Reminder:**  This decision tree is still *hypothetical* and needs to be trained on real data to be useful. The feature selection and thresholds would be determined by the learning algorithm during training.  Use `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn with real data for a truly accurate model.
