**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've used the voting outcomes (2 for yes) as thresholds, aligning with the provided feature encoding.  This makes the conditions in the `if` statements more interpretable.
* **Confidence Removed:** I've removed the confidence levels, as the function is designed to return a single prediction.  In a real-world scenario, you might want to include probabilities with the prediction.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now correctly reflects the truth values of each inner node's condition.
* **Clearer Structure:** The nested `if-else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree's logic, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
* **Example Usage:**  The provided example demonstrates how to use the function with a sample voter's data.


This revised function provides a more accurate and usable implementation of the decision tree, while adhering to the specified format and requirements. Remember, this example is still a simplified representation. A true model would be trained on actual voting data to discover more complex relationships and more accurate prediction boundaries.
