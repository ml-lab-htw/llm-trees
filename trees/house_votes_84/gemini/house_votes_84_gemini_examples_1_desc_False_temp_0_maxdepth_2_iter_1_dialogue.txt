```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Contra Aid: Yes (Republican leaning)
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2 # Physician Fee Freeze: Yes (Republican leaning)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Feature Selection:**  As before, we're using "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" and "physician-fee-freeze" as our key features.  These are chosen based on the (simplified) assumption that they were highly partisan issues at the time.  Remember, in a real-world scenario, you'd use data analysis and feature importance calculations to determine the best features.

2. **Thresholds:** The threshold for both features is set to `== 2`, representing a "yes" vote.  This aligns with our assumption that voting "yes" on these issues is more associated with the Republican party.

3. **Tree Structure (in the code):**
   - The `if nodes[0]` block corresponds to the first level of the tree, checking the vote on contra aid.
   - The nested `if nodes[1]` block corresponds to the second level, checking the vote on the physician fee freeze if the contra aid vote was "no" (1).

4. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which get coerced to 1/0 if used in an arithmetic operation) of the conditions at each inner node. This provides a record of the path taken through the tree for a given input.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output will be either 0 (Democrat) or 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output will be a list of two boolean values representing the decisions taken at each node. 
```


**Important Reminders:**  This is still a simplified example.  Real-world political data is complex.  With actual data, you would use machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal features, thresholds, and tree structure.
