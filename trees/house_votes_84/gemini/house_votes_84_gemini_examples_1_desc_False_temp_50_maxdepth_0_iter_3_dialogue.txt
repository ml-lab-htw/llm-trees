**Key improvements:**

* **Clear feature access:**  Uses `X['feature-name']` to access feature values correctly.
* **Encoding handled:** Uses the provided encoding (2 for "yes", 1 for "no").
* **Node list:** Creates and returns the `nodes` list as specified.
* **Example usage:** Demonstrates how to use the function with example data.
* **Conciseness:** Simplified the code structure while maintaining logic.
* **Corrected Node Handling:** Returns only the relevant nodes used in the prediction path, and ensures that 'nodes' list has the same length for different prediction paths.





This improved function accurately represents the hypothetical decision tree and adheres to the requested format.  Remember to replace the example data with your actual data and potentially adjust the tree structure based on your training results when working with real data.
