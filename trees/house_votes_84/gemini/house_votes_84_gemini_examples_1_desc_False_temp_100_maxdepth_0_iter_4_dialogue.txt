    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: yes (2)
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Aid to Contras: yes (2)

        else:           # Voted no on aid to Contras
            prediction = 0 # Democrat (likely)
    else:          # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if X['education-spending'] == 2: # Voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0 # Democrat (likely)
        else:                           # Voted no on education spending

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The code directly uses the provided feature encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no).
* **Clearer Node Logic:**  The `if/else` structure now explicitly checks for "yes" votes (value 2) making the logic more readable.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the decision logic at each branch, corresponding to the hypothetical tree structure.
* **List of Nodes:**  The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node. This list is returned along with the prediction.


This function implements the previously described hypothetical decision tree. Remember that without real training data, this is just an example and its accuracy on real-world data is unknown.  A real-world tree would require training on a dataset of Congressional voting records and party affiliations.
