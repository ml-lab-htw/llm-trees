You got it! I understand now. You want a Python function that represents a decision tree for predicting political party affiliation based on voting records, returning both the prediction and a list tracking the truth values at internal nodes. 

**Here's a template for the function, along with an example using hypothetical important features and thresholds:**

```python
def predict_party(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (1: Republican, 0: Democrat) based on voting record.

    Args:
      X (dict): A dictionary containing the individual's votes on each issue.
                 Keys should match the feature names exactly. 

    Returns:
      tuple: (prediction, nodes) 
              prediction (int): Predicted party (1 or 0)
              nodes (list): Truth values (1 or 0) for each internal node condition.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Adjust size based on tree depth

    # Example using "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" and "education-spending"
    # You'll need to determine these important features and thresholds
    # from your data and feature importance analysis. 
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # Assuming 2 means "yes"
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2       

    if nodes[0]:  
        prediction = 1 # Republican
    else: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Republican

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** `predict_party(X)` takes a dictionary `X` representing the voting record.
2. **Nodes List:** `nodes` stores the truth values (1 if the condition is True, 0 if False) for each internal node in the decision tree. The length of this list depends on the tree's depth.
3. **Feature Importance and Thresholds:**
   - You **must replace** the placeholder conditions with the actual most important features and their corresponding thresholds. 
   - For example, if your analysis shows that votes on "synfuels-corporation-cutback" and "mx-missile" are most important:
     -  Determine appropriate thresholds (e.g., voting "yes" or "no")
     -  Update the `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` assignments.
4. **Decision Tree Logic:** The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision tree logic. You might need to adjust these based on your tree's structure.
5. **Return Values:** The function returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 or 0) and the `nodes` list, which provides insights into the decision path.

**Key Steps You Need to Take:**

1. **Data Analysis:** Analyze your voting data to determine:
   - The two most important features for predicting party affiliation.
   - Appropriate thresholds for splitting the data based on these features.
2. **Update the Function:**
   - Replace the placeholders in `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` with the correct feature names and thresholds.
   - Adjust the `if` and `else` statements to reflect the decision logic of your final decision tree. 

Once you've completed these steps, the `predict_party` function will represent your custom decision tree for predicting party affiliation.
