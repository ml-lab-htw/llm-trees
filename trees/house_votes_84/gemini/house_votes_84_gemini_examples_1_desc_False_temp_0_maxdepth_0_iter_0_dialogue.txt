```python

    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Vote YES on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Vote YES on aid to Nicaraguan contras


    if nodes[0]:  # Voted YES on physician fee freeze

```



**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Feature Access:** The code directly uses the feature names from the provided list (e.g., `X['physician-fee-freeze']`) for better readability.

2. **Encoding Handling:** The code explicitly checks for the "yes" vote (encoded as `2`)  using `== 2`.

3. **Simplified Structure:** The code reflects the hypothetical decision tree's structure directly. The nested `if/else` statements correspond to the branches of the tree.

4. **Reduced Number of Nodes:** Only the decision nodes are included in the `nodes` list, making it more concise and aligned with the actual decision points in the tree.  The original example had some redundant checks.

5. **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds are now based on the vote encoding (2 for "yes").

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Predicted party affiliation: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True]
```


This improved function provides a more accurate and understandable implementation of the decision tree logic, while also adhering to the requested format and handling the provided feature encodings. Remember that this is a *hypothetical* example. A real-world implementation would require training a decision tree model on actual data.
