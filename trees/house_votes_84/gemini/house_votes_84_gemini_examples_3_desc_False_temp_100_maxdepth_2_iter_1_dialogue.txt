It's difficult to determine the *most important* features and accurate thresholds without analyzing real voting data. However, I can provide you with a Python function template based on your hypothetical decision tree and instructions:

```python
def predict_party(X: dict) -> (int, list):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on voting record.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary representing the individual's votes.
                           Keys should match the provided feature list. 
                           Values should be 2 for "yes" and 1 for "no".

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
            nodes (list): List of truth values (1 or 0) 
                          for conditions at each inner node.
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None] 

    # Example using 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' and 'education-spending'
    # Replace with actual most important features and thresholds after analysis
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Contras aid: Yes (2)
    nodes[1] = X['education-spending'] == 2  # Education spending: Yes (2)

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on Contras aid
        prediction = 1  # More likely Republican 
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on Education spending
            prediction = 0  # More likely Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # More likely Republican 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - `predict_party(X: dict)` defines the function that takes a dictionary of votes as input.

2. **Nodes List:**
   - `nodes = 2 * [None]` initializes a list to store truth values (1 or 0) for the conditions at each inner node of the decision tree. We have two inner nodes in this depth-2 tree.

3. **Feature and Threshold Logic:**
   - This section is where you apply the logic from your decision tree.
   - **Replace** the placeholder features (`'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'`, `'education-spending'`) and thresholds (using `== 2` for "yes" votes) with the actual most important features and their respective thresholds determined from your data analysis.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The `if-else` blocks mimic the decision paths in your tree, assigning a prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.

5. **Return:**
   - The function returns a tuple containing the predicted party affiliation and the `nodes` list.

**Key Points:**

* **Data Analysis:** You'll need to perform feature importance analysis on your voting data to identify the two most important features and determine the appropriate thresholds for splitting. 
* **Tree Structure:** Adjust the `nodes` list size and the `if-else` structure if your decision tree has a different depth or branching.

This Python function provides a framework for implementing your decision tree classifier. Remember to replace the placeholders with actual values obtained from analyzing your voting data.
