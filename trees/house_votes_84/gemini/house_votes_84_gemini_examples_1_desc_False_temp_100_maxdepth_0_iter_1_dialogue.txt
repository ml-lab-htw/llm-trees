This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree presented earlier.  Remember, this is a *demonstration* and isn't trained on real data.  It uses hardcoded thresholds (voting yes/no represented by 2/1 respectively) based on assumed political positions.  In a real application, these thresholds and the structure of the tree itself would be learned from data using a decision tree algorithm.
