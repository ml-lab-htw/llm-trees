You're right, I apologize for the error in my previous response. I missed the part where you specified the need for the labeled data and jumped to building a hypothetical tree. 

Since I still don't have the labeled voting data to calculate actual feature importance and thresholds, I'll create a Python function with placeholder features and thresholds. I'll use the features you provided and make some assumptions about potential important features based on common political stances.

 **Remember, without real data, this is just a template and the chosen features and thresholds are speculative.**

```python
def predict_party(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts political party affiliation based on voting record.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the voting record with keys corresponding
       to the voting issues.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - prediction: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
      - nodes: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
  """
  nodes = 2 * [None]

  # Hypothetical Important Feature 1: 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'
  nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Assuming 2 means "yes"

  # Hypothetical Important Feature 2: 'education-spending' 
  nodes[1] = X['education-spending'] == 2       # Assuming 2 means "yes"

  if nodes[0]:  # Voted "yes" on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    if nodes[1]:  # Also voted "yes" on education spending
      prediction = 1  # Likely Republican 
    else:           # Voted "no" on education spending 
      prediction = 1  # Still likely Republican
  else:            # Voted "no" on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    if nodes[1]:  # Voted "yes" on education spending
      prediction = 0  # Could be Democrat, but this is a split
    else:           # Voted "no" on education spending
      prediction = 0  # More likely Democrat

  return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (replace with actual voting record):
voting_record = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    # ... other voting records
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    # ... other voting records 
}

prediction, nodes = predict_party(voting_record)
print(f"Prediction (1=Republican, 0=Democrat): {prediction}")
print(f"Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**To make this function truly useful:**

1. **Provide the labeled voting dataset.**
2. **Choose a feature importance measure** (e.g., Gini impurity).

With that information, I can train a decision tree classifier, determine the most important features, calculate appropriate thresholds, and create a much more accurate prediction function.
