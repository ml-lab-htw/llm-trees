**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder Values:**  Since you haven't provided training data, I've had to make reasonable assumptions about which features are important and what split points might be useful.  These are placeholders.  *With real data, a decision tree algorithm would determine the best features and splits.*

2. **Feature Encoding:**  I've incorporated the feature encoding you provided (1=no, 2=yes for the votes, and 0=Democrat, 1=Republican for the party). The code directly uses these encoded values.

3. **Depth 5:** The tree reaches a maximum depth of 5, as required.

4. **Hypothetical Splits:** The choices of `physician-fee-freeze`, `education-spending`, `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`, `el-salvador-adi`, and `anti-satellite-test-ban`, and the split points are hypothetical.  **Real-world data is crucial to determine the actual important features and splits.**

5. **Node List:** The `nodes` list is initialized with `None` and then populated with boolean values representing the truthiness of each condition in the tree.  Finally, the boolean values are converted to integers (1 for True, 0 for False) before returning.

**To make this a truly effective decision tree, you *must* provide training data.  With data, you can use libraries like scikit-learn (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) to train a model based on real-world voting patterns.**  The resulting tree will be much more accurate and reliable.
