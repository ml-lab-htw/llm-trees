```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # Physician fee freeze: 2=yes
    nodes[1] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2 # Aid to contras: 2=yes



    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on aid to contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted no on aid to contras
            prediction = 0 # Democrat
    else:  # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if X['education-spending'] == 2: # Voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else: # Voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Feature Encoding:** The code now explicitly checks for the value `2` (representing "yes") for the votes, making the logic more readable and aligned with the provided feature encoding.

2. **Simplified Structure:** The nested `if` statements directly reflect the decision tree logic, making the code easier to follow.

3. **Removed Placeholders:** The provided thresholds are used directly in the code.

4. **Consistent Target Encoding:** The prediction returns `1` for Republican and `0` for Democrat, consistent with the specified target encoding.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}


prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```


This example demonstrates how the function takes a dictionary of voter features and returns the predicted party affiliation and the truth values of the decision nodes. Remember that this is still a *simplified* example.  A real-world model would be trained on data and would likely be more complex.
