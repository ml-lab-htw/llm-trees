This function implements the illustrative decision tree logic based on historically significant votes and the provided feature descriptions.  It's crucial to remember that this is a *simplified example* and not a tree trained on real data. The actual feature importance and thresholds would be different if you were to train a decision tree model using a machine learning library on a real dataset.  This example only serves to demonstrate how to structure such a function using the specified feature names and encoding.
