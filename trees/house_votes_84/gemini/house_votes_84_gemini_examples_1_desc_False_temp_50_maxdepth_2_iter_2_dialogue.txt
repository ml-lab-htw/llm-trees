Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Feature Names and Encoding:**  Uses the provided feature names and encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no).
* **Clearer Logic:** The code comments explain the decision logic more clearly.
* **Consistent Return Type:** Returns the `nodes` list with integer (1/0) values as requested.
* **Example Usage:** Includes an example demonstrating how to use the function.

This revised version addresses the previous issues and provides a more robust and accurate implementation of the decision tree prediction function. Remember that the feature importance and thresholds used are still assumptions.  For a real-world application, you would need to train a decision tree model on actual data.
