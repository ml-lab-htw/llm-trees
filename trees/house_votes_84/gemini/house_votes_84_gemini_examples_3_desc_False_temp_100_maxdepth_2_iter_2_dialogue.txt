You got it! Here is the Python function representing a hypothetical decision tree of depth 2 for predicting party affiliation based on your provided voting data features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation based on voting record.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of voting records, 
                   where keys are feature names and values are 1 (no) or 2 (yes).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            - prediction (int): 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat.
            - nodes (list): Truth values (1 or 0) for each inner node condition.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Hypothetical Decision Tree (depth 2)
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # Voted yes on Contra Aid
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2      # Voted yes on Physician Fee Freeze

    if nodes[0]:  # Voted yes on Contra Aid
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted yes on Physician Fee Freeze
            prediction = 1  # Likely Republican
        else:             # Voted no on Physician Fee Freeze
            prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat 
    else:              # Voted no on Contra Aid
        prediction = 0  # Likely Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage
voting_record = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    # ... other features ...
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2, 
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(voting_record)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1: Republican, 0: Democrat)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

* **`predict(X)` function:**
   - Takes a dictionary `X` representing a single politician's voting record.
   - Initializes `nodes` list to store the truth values of the inner node conditions.
* **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - **`nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2`**:  This is the first split. If the politician voted "yes" (value 2) on aid to Nicaraguan Contras, `nodes[0]` is set to `True` (1), otherwise `False` (0). 
   - **`nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2`**:  The second split depends on the first. If the politician voted "yes" on the physician fee freeze, `nodes[1]` is set to `True` (1), otherwise `False` (0).
* **Prediction:**
    - The `if` and `else` statements implement the tree's branches, leading to a final prediction of 1 (Republican) or 0 (Democrat).

**Important Notes:**

* **This decision tree is hypothetical!**  You'll need actual voting data and a tree-building algorithm to determine the most important features and appropriate thresholds for splitting. 
* **Depth Limitation:** The depth of 2 might be too restrictive for complex real-world scenarios. 
* **Ethical Considerations:** Remember to use such models carefully and be aware of potential biases. 

Let me know when you have the real voting data, and I can help you build a more accurate decision tree.
