Certainly! Based on your specifications, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Evaluate the conditions at each node and store 1 if true, 0 if false
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 1)  # Vote on physician fee freeze: No
    nodes[1] = int(X['el-salvador-adi'] == 2)       # Vote on aid to El Salvador: Yes
    nodes[2] = int(X['crime'] == 2)                 # Vote on crime: Yes

    # Decision logic based on the evaluated nodes
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2] == 1:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:**
  - `nodes[0]` checks if the vote on **physician fee freeze** is **No** (`1`).
  - `nodes[1]` checks if the vote on **aid to El Salvador** is **Yes** (`2`).
  - `nodes[2]` checks if the vote on **crime** legislation is **Yes** (`2`).
  - Each node stores `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If `nodes[0]` is `1`** (voted No on physician fee freeze):
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Democrat)
  - **Else** (voted Yes on physician fee freeze):
    - **If `nodes[1]` is `1`** (voted Yes on aid to El Salvador):
      - **Prediction:** `1` (Republican)
    - **Else:**
      - **If `nodes[2]` is `1`** (voted Yes on crime legislation):
        - **Prediction:** `1` (Republican)
      - **Else:**
        - **Prediction:** `0` (Democrat)

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a representative with the following votes:

- `'physician-fee-freeze'`: `2` (Yes)
- `'el-salvador-adi'`: `1` (No)
- `'crime'`: `2` (Yes)

We can predict their party affiliation as follows:

```python
X = {
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'crime': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Votes are encoded as:
    - `2`: Yes
    - `1`: No
  - Ensure the input dictionary `X` uses these exact keys and encodings.

- **Function Structure:**
  - The function strictly follows the decision tree logic with a maximum depth of 3.
  - The `nodes` list reflects the truth values of the inner nodes:
    - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
    - `0` if not.

- **Thresholds and Conditions:**
  - Since the features are categorical (Yes/No votes with specific encodings), the conditions are equality checks.
  - The thresholds are the specific vote encodings (`1` for No, `2` for Yes), which are meaningful and directly used in the conditions.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Exact Feature Keys:**

  ```python
  ['handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing', 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', 
   'physician-fee-freeze', 'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools', 
   'anti-satellite-test-ban', 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 'mx-missile', 'immigration', 
   'synfuels-corporation-cutback', 'education-spending', 'superfund-right-to-sue', 
   'crime', 'duty-free-exports', 'export-administration-act-south-africa']
  ```

- **Feature Encodings:**

  - All votes are encoded as:
    - `2`: Yes
    - `1`: No

- **Target Variable:**

  - `'party affiliation'`:
    - `1`: Republican
    - `0`: Democrat

**Summary:**

- This function implements the decision tree classifier you provided.
- It checks the most informative features to classify a representative as a Democrat or Republican.
- The `nodes` list helps trace the path taken in the tree for a given prediction.
