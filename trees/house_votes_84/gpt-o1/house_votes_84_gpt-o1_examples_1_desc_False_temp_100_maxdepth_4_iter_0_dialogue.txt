Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list of 4 nodes (maximum depth of 4)
    
    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1
        nodes[1] = int(X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2
            nodes[2] = int(X["duty-free-exports"] == 2)
            # Since both outcomes lead to Republican, Node 3 is not used here
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            nodes[3] = 1  # Placeholder to maintain depth of 4
        else:
            # Node 2
            nodes[2] = int(X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 2)
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            nodes[3] = 1  # Placeholder to maintain depth of 4
    else:
        # Node 1
        nodes[1] = int(X["education-spending"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2
            nodes[2] = int(X["crime"] == 2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            nodes[3] = 1  # Placeholder to maintain depth of 4
        else:
            # Node 2
            nodes[2] = int(X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2)
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            nodes[3] = 1  # Placeholder to maintain depth of 4

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization**: `nodes = [None] * 4` creates a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes, corresponding to the maximum depth of 4.
  
- **Node Conditions**:
  - **Node 0**: Checks if the vote on *physician-fee-freeze* is **"yes"** (encoded as `2`).
    ```python
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    ```
  
- **First Branch** (`nodes[0] == 1`):
  - **Node 1**: Checks if the vote on *adoption-of-the-budget-resolution* is **"yes"**.
    ```python
    nodes[1] = int(X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2)
    ```
  - **Second Level**:
    - **If `nodes[1] == 1`**:
      - **Node 2**: Checks if the vote on *duty-free-exports* is **"yes"**.
        ```python
        nodes[2] = int(X["duty-free-exports"] == 2)
        ```
      - Both outcomes lead to **Republican**, so `prediction = 1`.
      - **Node 3**: Set to `1` as a placeholder to maintain depth 4.
    - **If `nodes[1] == 0`**:
      - **Node 2**: Checks if the vote on *synfuels-corporation-cutback* is **"yes"**.
        ```python
        nodes[2] = int(X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 2)
        ```
      - **If `nodes[2] == 1`**: `prediction = 0` (**Democrat**)
      - **Else**: `prediction = 1` (**Republican**)
      - **Node 3**: Set to `1` as a placeholder to maintain depth 4.
  
- **Second Branch** (`nodes[0] == 0`):
  - **Node 1**: Checks if the vote on *education-spending* is **"yes"**.
    ```python
    nodes[1] = int(X["education-spending"] == 2)
    ```
  - **Second Level**:
    - **If `nodes[1] == 1`**:
      - **Node 2**: Checks if the vote on *crime* is **"yes"**.
        ```python
        nodes[2] = int(X["crime"] == 2)
        ```
      - Both outcomes lead to **Democrat**, so `prediction = 0`.
      - **Node 3**: Set to `1` as a placeholder to maintain depth 4.
    - **If `nodes[1] == 0`**:
      - **Node 2**: Checks if the vote on *aid-to-nicaraguan-contras* is **"yes"**.
        ```python
        nodes[2] = int(X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2)
        ```
      - **If `nodes[2] == 1`**: `prediction = 1` (**Republican**)
      - **Else**: `prediction = 0` (**Democrat**)
      - **Node 3**: Set to `1` as a placeholder to maintain depth 4.

- **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied (True)
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied (False)
  - In this example, `nodes[3]` is used as a placeholder to maintain the maximum depth of 4, even though the tree reaches a leaf node at depth 3. It's set to `1` to indicate the condition is considered satisfied at this placeholder level.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a voting record for a congress member:

```python
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Note:**

- The decision tree has been structured to maintain a maximum depth of 4 as per your request.
- **Feature Key Names and Encoding**: All feature keys and their encodings match the exact specifications you provided.
- **Interpretation of Nodes**:
  - Each `nodes[i]` corresponds to the truth value (`1` or `0`) of the condition at that level.
  - The list `nodes` helps trace the path taken in the decision tree for a given input.

---

**Understanding the Decision Path:**

- **Nodes[0]**: Did the congress member vote **"yes"** on *physician-fee-freeze*?
- **Nodes[1]**:
  - If **Nodes[0] == 1**: Did they vote **"yes"** on *adoption-of-the-budget-resolution*?
  - If **Nodes[0] == 0**: Did they vote **"yes"** on *education-spending*?
- **Nodes[2]**:
  - Depending on previous nodes, checks votes on:
    - *duty-free-exports*,
    - *synfuels-corporation-cutback*,
    - *crime*,
    - *aid-to-nicaraguan-contras*.
- **Nodes[3]**: Placeholder to maintain depth 4.

This function will help you classify the party affiliation of a congress member based on their voting record, using the most significant features up to a maximum depth of 4.
