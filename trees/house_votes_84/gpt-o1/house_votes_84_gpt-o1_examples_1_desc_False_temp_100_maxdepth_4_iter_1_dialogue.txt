Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree, formatted as per your instructions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values for 3 inner nodes

    # Node 0: Checks if 'physician-fee-freeze' vote is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is True, predict Republican (1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Checks if 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' vote is 'yes'
        nodes[1] = int(X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is True, predict Democrat (0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 2: Checks if 'mx-missile' vote is 'yes'
            nodes[2] = int(X['mx-missile'] == 2)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Node 2 condition is True, predict Republican (1)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If all conditions above are False, predict Democrat (0)
                prediction = 0

    # Replace any uninitialized nodes with 0
    nodes = [node if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:**
  - `X`: A dictionary where keys are the exact feature names, and values are the encoded feature values as specified.
- **Outputs:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
  - `nodes`: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- Feature values are encoded as:
  - `2` for 'yes'
  - `1` for 'no'

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Get the prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Note:**

- The order of nodes in the `nodes` list corresponds to the sequence in which the conditions are evaluated in the decision tree.
- If a node's condition is not evaluated because a previous condition directed the flow away from it, its value in the list will be `0` (as per the instruction to represent uninitialized nodes with `0`).
- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the correct keys and value encodings.
