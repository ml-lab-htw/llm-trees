Certainly! Based on the provided decision tree and feature encodings, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 represents 'yes'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Key Matching:** We use `"physician-fee-freeze"` as the key to access the feature in the input dictionary `X`. This matches the exact spelling provided.

- **Condition Encoding:** Since a vote of 'yes' is encoded as `2`, the condition `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2` checks if the vote was 'yes'.

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list contains the truth value of the inner node condition. It will contain `1` if the condition is `True` (i.e., the vote was 'yes') and `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction:** If the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the prediction is `1` (Republican). Otherwise, it's `0` (Democrat).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a sample input:

```python
sample_input = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Voted 'yes'
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    # ... other features
}
```

Calling the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [True]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required feature keys with correctly encoded values as specified.
