```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the vote on adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied (voted 'yes'), predict Republican
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the vote on physician-fee-freeze is 'yes' (2)
        nodes[1] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)

        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied (voted 'yes'), predict Democrat
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # If neither condition is satisfied, predict Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**
  - We initialize a list `nodes` with `None` values to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - The list has a length of 2 because our decision tree has two nodes (excluding leaf nodes).

- **Node 0:**
  - We check if the congressperson voted **'yes'** on the **'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'**.
  - Since the encoding for **'yes'** is `2`, we compare `X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"]` to `2`.
  - We store the result (`1` for True, `0` for False) in `nodes[0]`.

- **Decision at Node 0:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (True), the prediction is `1` (Republican).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (False), we proceed to check the next condition.

- **Node 1:**
  - We check if the congressperson voted **'yes'** on the **'physician-fee-freeze'**.
  - We store the result in `nodes[1]`.

- **Decision at Node 1:**
  - If `nodes[1]` is `1` (True), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
  - If `nodes[1]` is `0` (False), the prediction is `1` (Republican).

- **Return Values:**
  - The function returns the `prediction` and the `nodes` list.
    - `prediction`: `1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat.
    - `nodes`: A list of `0` and `1` indicating whether the conditions at each node were satisfied.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,  # Voted 'no' (1)
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,               # Voted 'yes' (2)
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Explanation of Example:**

- `nodes[0]` is `0` because `X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"]` is `1` ('no').
- Since `nodes[0]` is `0`, we check `nodes[1]`.
- `nodes[1]` is `1` because `X["physician-fee-freeze"]` is `2` ('yes').
- Since `nodes[1]` is `1`, the prediction is `0` (Democrat).

**Notes:**

- **Feature Names:** The feature keys in the input dictionary `X` must match exactly as specified, including hyphens and lowercase letters.
- **Feature Encodings:** 
  - Votes are encoded as `2` for **'yes'** and `1` for **'no'**.
  - The target variable is encoded as `1` for **Republican** and `0` for **Democrat**.
- **Placeholders and Thresholds:** In this case, since the features are categorical with specific encodings, there are no numeric thresholds to fill in. We compare the feature values directly to their encoded values.

Feel free to provide an input dictionary, and I can demonstrate how the function works with that input.
