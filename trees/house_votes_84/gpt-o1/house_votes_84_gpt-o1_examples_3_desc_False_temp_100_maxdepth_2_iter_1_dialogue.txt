Certainly! Based on the decision tree provided earlier and the exact feature names and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` of feature values, uses the decision tree logic to make a prediction, and returns the prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'physician-fee-freeze' vote is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If 'yes', predict Republican
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'el-salvador-adi' vote is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
        nodes[1] = int(X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If 'yes', predict Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # If 'no', predict Democrat
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Votes are encoded as:
    - **2**: Yes
    - **1**: No
  - Target variable (party affiliation) is encoded as:
    - **1**: Republican
    - **0**: Democrat

- **Decision Logic:**

  1. **Node 0:** Check the vote on **'physician-fee-freeze'**:
     - If **'yes'** (`X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2`):
       - Set `nodes[0] = 1` (condition satisfied).
       - **Predict:** **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else:
       - Set `nodes[0] = 0` (condition not satisfied).
       - Proceed to Node 1.

  2. **Node 1:** Check the vote on **'el-salvador-adi'**:
     - If **'yes'** (`X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2`):
       - Set `nodes[1] = 1` (condition satisfied).
       - **Predict:** **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Else:
       - Set `nodes[1] = 0` (condition not satisfied).
       - **Predict:** **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a congressperson with the following votes:

```python
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}
```

Predicting party affiliation:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, None]
```

- The first node condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), so the model predicts Republican without needing to evaluate the second node.

**Notes:**

- The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes[0]`: Result of the first condition (`'physician-fee-freeze' == 2`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Result of the second condition (`'el-salvador-adi' == 2`) if evaluated.
- If a node is not evaluated (because the decision was already made at a previous node), its value remains `None`.

**Feature List and Encodings:**

- **Features:**
  - `'handicapped-infants'`: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'water-project-cost-sharing'`: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'physician-fee-freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'el-salvador-adi'`: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'religious-groups-in-schools'`: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'anti-satellite-test-ban'`: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'`: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'mx-missile'`: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'immigration'`: Vote on immigration (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'synfuels-corporation-cutback'`: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'education-spending'`: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'superfund-right-to-sue'`: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'crime'`: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'duty-free-exports'`: Vote on duty-free exports (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `'export-administration-act-south-africa'`: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes, 1 = no)

- **Target Variable:**
  - `party affiliation`: (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)

This function adheres to the specified format and accurately represents the decision tree classifier based on the most informative features for predicting party affiliation.
