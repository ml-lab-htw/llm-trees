Sure! Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features, checks the condition at the node, and returns the prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    # Check if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (encoded as 1)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** This represents the truth value of the condition at the root node.
  - `nodes[0] = 1` if the condition `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1` (i.e., voted 'no') is satisfied.
  - `nodes[0] = 0` otherwise.
- **Prediction:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (voted 'no' on physician fee freeze), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze), the prediction is `1` (Republican).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a congressperson with the following voting record:

```python
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # Voted 'no'
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}
```

We can predict their party affiliation as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [1]
```

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the feature keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the specified keys, including case and hyphens.
- The votes are encoded as:
  - `2` for **Yes**
  - `1` for **No**
- The target variable `party affiliation` is encoded as:
  - `1` for **Republican**
  - `0` for **Democrat**

**Explanation of the Decision Tree Logic:**

The decision tree uses the vote on the **physician fee freeze** as the decision criterion because it is the most informative feature for predicting party affiliation in this context.

- **If a congressperson voted 'no' (encoded as `1`) on the physician fee freeze:**
  - They are predicted to be a **Democrat** (prediction `0`).
- **If a congressperson voted 'yes' (encoded as `2`) on the physician fee freeze:**
  - They are predicted to be a **Republican** (prediction `1`).

This simple tree effectively classifies the party affiliation based on a single significant vote.
