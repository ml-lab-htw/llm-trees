Certainly! Below is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that takes a dictionary `X` containing the features, returns a single prediction (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican), and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze == yes (2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2
    
    # Node 1: Vote on aid to El Salvador == yes (2 = yes)
    nodes[1] = X['el-salvador-adi'] == 2
    
    # Node 2: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == yes (2 = yes)
    nodes[2] = X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2
    
    # Node 3: Vote on MX missile == yes (2 = yes)
    nodes[3] = X['mx-missile'] == 2
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Node 0
        # If voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # If voted 'no' on physician fee freeze
        if not nodes[1]:  # Node 1
            # If voted 'no' on aid to El Salvador
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # If voted 'yes' on aid to El Salvador
            if nodes[2]:  # Node 2
                # If voted 'yes' on adoption of the budget resolution
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                # If voted 'no' on adoption of the budget resolution
                if not nodes[3]:  # Node 3
                    # If voted 'no' on MX missile
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    # If voted 'yes' on MX missile
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** The list `nodes` contains the truth values (`True` or `False`) of the conditions at each decision point in the tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the vote on **physician-fee-freeze** is 'yes' (encoded as `2`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the vote on **el-salvador-adi** is 'yes'.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the vote on **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution** is 'yes'.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the vote on **mx-missile** is 'yes'.
  
- **Decision Logic:**
  - **Node 0**: If the representative voted 'yes' on the physician fee freeze, they are classified as a **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Node 1**: If they voted 'no' on the physician fee freeze, we check their vote on aid to El Salvador.
    - If they voted 'no' on aid to El Salvador, they are classified as a **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If they voted 'yes' on aid to El Salvador, we proceed to **Node 2**.
  - **Node 2**: Check the vote on adoption of the budget resolution.
    - If they voted 'yes', they are classified as a **Republican**.
    - If they voted 'no', proceed to **Node 3**.
  - **Node 3**: Check the vote on MX missile.
    - If they voted 'no', they are classified as a **Democrat**.
    - If they voted 'yes', they are classified as a **Republican**.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a representative with the following votes:

```python
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}
```

We can predict their party affiliation:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [True, False, False, True]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0]` is `True` because the representative voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze.
  - Since `nodes[0]` is `True`, the prediction is **Republican**.

**Note on Thresholds and Encoding:**

- All votes are encoded as:
  - `2` for **yes**
  - `1` for **no**
  
- The target variable `party affiliation` is encoded as:
  - `1` for **Republican**
  - `0` for **Democrat**

- The conditions directly check for equality (`== 2`) to determine if a 'yes' vote was cast on an issue.

**Complete List of Feature Keys and Encoding:**

  - `'handicapped-infants'`: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants.

**Testing the Function with Multiple Inputs:**

You can test the `predict` function with different voting records to see how the prediction and nodes change:

```python
# Example 1: Likely a Democrat
X_democrat = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # No
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,       # No
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_democrat)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
# Output should be 'Democrat' with appropriate node evaluations.

# Example 2: Likely a Republican
X_republican = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,       # Yes
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_republican)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
# Output should be 'Republican' with appropriate node evaluations.
```
