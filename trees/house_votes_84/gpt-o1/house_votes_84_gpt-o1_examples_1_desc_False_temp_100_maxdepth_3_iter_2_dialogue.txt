Certainly! Here's the formatted decision tree as a Python function. It returns a single prediction (party affiliation) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. 

**Features:**

- **handicapped-infants**: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **water-project-cost-sharing**: Vote on water project cost sharing (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution**: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **physician-fee-freeze**: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **el-salvador-adi**: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **religious-groups-in-schools**: Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **anti-satellite-test-ban**: Vote on anti-satellite test ban (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **aid-to-nicaraguan-contras**: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **mx-missile**: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **immigration**: Vote on immigration (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **synfuels-corporation-cutback**: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **education-spending**: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **superfund-right-to-sue**: Vote on superfund right to sue (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **crime**: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **duty-free-exports**: Vote on duty-free exports (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **export-administration-act-south-africa**: Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (2 = yes, 1 = no)

**Target variable:**

- **party affiliation**: (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze? (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2 else 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If "yes" on physician fee freeze
        # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution? (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2 else 0

        if nodes[1]:  # If "yes" on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            nodes[2] = None  # No further node
        else:  # If "no" on adoption of the budget resolution
            # Node 2: Vote on crime? (2 = yes, 1 = no)
            nodes[2] = 1 if X["crime"] == 2 else 0

            if nodes[2]:  # If "yes" on crime
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # If "no" on crime
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If "no" on physician fee freeze
        # Node 1: Vote on education spending? (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["education-spending"] == 2 else 0
        nodes[2] = None  # No further node
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** checks if the vote on **physician-fee-freeze** is "yes" (2). This is the root node.
  - If **nodes[0] == 1** (condition satisfied):
    - **nodes[1]** checks if the vote on **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution** is "yes" (2).
      - If **nodes[1] == 1**:
        - Prediction is **1 (Republican)**.
        - **nodes[2]** is **None** because we have reached a leaf node.
      - If **nodes[1] == 0**:
        - **nodes[2]** checks if the vote on **crime** is "yes" (2).
          - If **nodes[2] == 1**:
            - Prediction is **1 (Republican)**.
          - If **nodes[2] == 0**:
            - Prediction is **0 (Democrat)**.
  - If **nodes[0] == 0** (condition not satisfied):
    - **nodes[1]** checks if the vote on **education-spending** is "yes" (2).
      - Regardless of **nodes[1]**, the prediction is **0 (Democrat)**.
    - **nodes[2]** is **None** because we have reached a leaf node.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a representative with the following votes:

```python
example_vote = {
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,  # yes
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,  # no
    "crime": 2,  # yes
    "education-spending": 1,  # no
    # ... Other features can be included as needed
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_vote)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- **Node 0**: Physician fee freeze vote is "yes" (nodes[0] == 1).
- **Node 1**: Adoption of the budget resolution vote is "no" (nodes[1] == 0).
- **Node 2**: Crime vote is "yes" (nodes[2] == 1).
- **Prediction**: Since nodes[2] == 1, the representative is predicted to be **Republican**.

**Notes:**

- **Thresholds and Conditions**: The decision tree uses equality checks against the encoded vote values (2 for "yes", 1 for "no") as thresholds.
- **Node List**: The `nodes` list contains truth values for the inner nodes:
  - **1** if the condition is satisfied.
  - **0** if the condition is not satisfied.
  - **None** if the node was not reached during prediction.
- **Maximum Depth**: The decision tree has a maximum depth of **3**, complying with the requirement.

This function models the decision-making process of classifying a representative's party affiliation based on key votes that significantly differentiate between Democrats and Republicans. It allows for tracing the path taken in the tree through the `nodes` list.
