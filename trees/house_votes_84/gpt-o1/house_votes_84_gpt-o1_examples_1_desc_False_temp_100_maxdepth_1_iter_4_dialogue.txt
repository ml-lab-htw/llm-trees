```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `"physician-fee-freeze"`
- **Condition:** `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2`
  - Here, `2` represents a 'yes' vote.
- **Nodes List:** `nodes[0]` will be `1` if the condition is `True` (i.e., the vote was 'yes'), and `0` otherwise.
- **Prediction:**
  - If the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), the model predicts `1` (Republican).
  - If not, it predicts `0` (Democrat).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a congressperson with the following votes:

```python
sample_input = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes traversal: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes traversal: [1]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with their corresponding encoded values as specified.
