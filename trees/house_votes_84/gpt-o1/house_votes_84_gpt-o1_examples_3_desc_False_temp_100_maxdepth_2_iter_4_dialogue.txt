Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if 'physician-fee-freeze' vote is 'no' (encoded as 1)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 1)
    if nodes[0] == 1:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'el-salvador-adi' vote is 'yes' (encoded as 2)
        nodes[1] = int(X['el-salvador-adi'] == 2)
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is 'no' (encoded as `1`). If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), the function predicts `0` (Democrat).
- **Node 1:** If the first condition is not satisfied, it checks if the vote on "el-salvador-adi" is 'yes' (encoded as `2`). If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] == 1`), the function predicts `1` (Republican). Otherwise, it predicts `0` (Democrat).
- The `nodes` list contains `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a sample input:

```python
X_sample = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [1, None]
```

- The first node condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), so the prediction is `Democrat`, and no further nodes are evaluated.

**Note on Feature Encoding:**

- `'yes'` votes are encoded as `2`.
- `'no'` votes are encoded as `1`.
- The target variable `party affiliation` is encoded as `1` for Republican and `0` for Democrat.
