Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the specifications you've provided, here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. The function returns a single prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # There are three inner nodes in the tree
    # Node 0: Check 'physician-fee-freeze' vote
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:  # 'physician-fee-freeze' == 'yes'
        # Node 1: Check 'handicapped-infants' vote
        nodes[1] = int(X['handicapped-infants'] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:  # 'handicapped-infants' == 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # 'physician-fee-freeze' == 'no'
        # Node 2: Check 'el-salvador-adi' vote
        nodes[2] = int(X['el-salvador-adi'] == 1)
        if nodes[2]:  # 'el-salvador-adi' == 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** We start by checking the vote on the **physician fee freeze**.
  - If the congressperson voted **'yes'** (`X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2`), we proceed to **Node 1**.
  - If they voted **'no'**, we proceed to **Node 2**.

- **Node 1:** Here, we check the vote on **handicapped infants**.
  - If they voted **'yes'** (`X['handicapped-infants'] == 2`), we predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If they voted **'no'**, we predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

- **Node 2:** Here, we check the vote on **aid to El Salvador**.
  - If they voted **'no'** (`X['el-salvador-adi'] == 1`), we predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If they voted **'yes'**, we predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).

**Note on the `nodes` list:**

- `nodes[0]`: Represents whether the condition at **Node 0** is satisfied (`1` if **'physician-fee-freeze' == 2**, else `0`).
- `nodes[1]`: Represents the condition at **Node 1**; it is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `1`.
- `nodes[2]`: Represents the condition at **Node 2**; it is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `0`.
- Unused nodes in a particular prediction path will remain `None`.

**Example Usage:**

Let's test the function with an example input:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,                # 'yes'
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,         # 'no'
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,  # 'no'
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,               # 'yes'
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,                    # 'no'
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,        # 'no'
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,            # 'yes'
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,          # 'no'
    'mx-missile': 2,                         # 'yes'
    'immigration': 2,                        # 'yes'
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,       # 'no'
    'education-spending': 2,                 # 'yes'
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,             # 'yes'
    'crime': 2,                              # 'yes'
    'duty-free-exports': 2,                  # 'yes'
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1  # 'no'
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 1, None]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 1`: The condition at Node 0 (`'physician-fee-freeze' == 2`) is **True**.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The condition at Node 1 (`'handicapped-infants' == 2`) is **True**.
- `nodes[2] = None`: Node 2 was not evaluated since the path didn't reach it.
- The model predicts **Republican**.

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure that the keys in your input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature names provided, including spelling and hyphens.
- The feature values should be encoded as specified:
  - Votes are encoded as `2` for **'yes'** and `1` for **'no'**.
- The target variable is encoded as `1` for **Republican** and `0` for **Democrat**.
- The function respects a maximum depth of 3 in the decision tree, as requested.
