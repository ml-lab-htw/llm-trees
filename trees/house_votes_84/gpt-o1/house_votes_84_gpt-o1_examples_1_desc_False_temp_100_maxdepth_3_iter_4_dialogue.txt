```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the vote on 'physician-fee-freeze' is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the condition is satisfied, predict 'Republican' (encoded as 1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the vote on 'el-salvador-adi' is 'Yes' (encoded as 2)
        nodes[1] = int(X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the condition is satisfied, predict 'Republican' (encoded as 1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If none of the above conditions are satisfied, predict 'Democrat' (encoded as 0)
            prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision point in the tree:
    - `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2` checks if the vote on the physician fee freeze is 'Yes'.
    - If this condition is true (`1`), we predict 'Republican'.
    - Otherwise, we proceed to the next node.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision point:
    - `X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2` checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is 'Yes'.
    - If this condition is true (`1`), we predict 'Republican'.
    - Otherwise, we predict 'Democrat'.

- **Prediction Encoding:**
  - `1` represents **Republican**.
  - `0` represents **Democrat**.

- **Nodes Encoding:**
  - Each entry in the `nodes` list is either `1` (condition satisfied) or `0` (condition not satisfied).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a congressperson with the following voting record:

```python
sample_record = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,          # Voted 'No'
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,               # Voted 'Yes'
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}
```

We can make a prediction as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_record)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 0` means the congressperson voted 'No' on the physician fee freeze.
- Since the first condition was not satisfied, we checked the second node.
- `nodes[1] = 1` means the congressperson voted 'Yes' on aid to El Salvador.
- Based on the decision tree, the model predicts that this congressperson is a **Republican**.

**Note:**

- Replace the `sample_record` values with the actual voting records you wish to classify.
- Ensure that all feature keys match exactly as specified and that the feature values use the correct encoding.
