Sure! Based on your request, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function following the examples you've provided. The function will:

- Use the exact feature keys you've specified, paying close attention to spelling and casing.
- Return a single prediction (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
- The entries in the nodes list will be `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the vote on 'physician-fee-freeze' is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted 'yes' on 'physician-fee-freeze', predict Republican
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the vote on 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' is 'yes' (2)
        nodes[1] = int(X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If voted 'yes' on 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', predict Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Democrat
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Votes are encoded as:
    - `2` for **'yes'**
    - `1` for **'no'**
  - Party affiliation is encoded as:
    - `1` for **Republican**
    - `0` for **Democrat**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first split:
    - `1` if `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2` (voted 'yes')
    - `0` otherwise
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second split (evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 0`):
    - `1` if `X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2` (voted 'yes')
    - `0` otherwise

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you might use this function:

```python
# Example input
X_input = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_input)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

In this example:

- The congressperson voted **'no'** (`1`) on `'physician-fee-freeze'`, so `nodes[0]` is `0`.
- Since `nodes[0]` is `0`, we check the second condition.
- They voted **'yes'** (`2`) on `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`, so `nodes[1]` is `1`.
- Therefore, the prediction is `Republican`.

**Note:** Please ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the feature keys exactly as specified, and that the vote values are correctly encoded as `2` for 'yes' and `1` for 'no'.
