Sure! Based on the decision tree provided and the specifications you've given, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
        nodes[1] = 0  # Not evaluated
    else:
        nodes[1] = int(X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**
  - The features are taken directly from the keys you provided. Pay attention to the exact spelling and casing.
    ```python
    # Example feature input:
    X = {
        'handicapped-infants': ...,
        'water-project-cost-sharing': ...,
        'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': ...,
        'physician-fee-freeze': ...,
        'el-salvador-adi': ...,  # Note: 'adi' as given in your feature list
        'religious-groups-in-schools': ...,
        'anti-satellite-test-ban': ...,
        'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': ...,
        'mx-missile': ...,
        'immigration': ...,
        'synfuels-corporation-cutback': ...,
        'education-spending': ...,
        'superfund-right-to-sue': ...,
        'crime': ...,
        'duty-free-exports': ...,
        'export-administration-act-south-africa': ...
    }
    ```

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - Each feature is encoded as `2` for **yes** and `1` for **no**.
  - The target variable `party affiliation` is encoded as `1` for **Republican** and `0` for **Democrat**.

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  1. **Node 0 (Root Node):**
     - Checks if the vote on **physician fee freeze** is **yes** (`2`).
       ```python
       nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
       ```
     - If **yes** (`nodes[0] == 1`), predicts **Democrat** (`0`) and sets `nodes[1]` to `0` (not evaluated).
     - If **no** (`nodes[0] == 0`), proceeds to Node 1.
  2. **Node 1:**
     - Checks if the vote on **aid to El Salvador** (`"el-salvador-adi"`) is **yes** (`2`).
       ```python
       nodes[1] = int(X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2)
       ```
     - If **yes** (`nodes[1] == 1`), predicts **Republican** (`1`).
     - If **no** (`nodes[1] == 0`), predicts **Democrat** (`0`).

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
  - `nodes`: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:
    - `nodes[0]`: `1` if `physician-fee-freeze == 2` (**yes**), else `0`.
    - `nodes[1]`: `1` if `el-salvador-adi == 2` (**yes**), else `0`. If not evaluated (because `nodes[0] == 1`), it's set to `0`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the congressperson voted 'no' on physician fee freeze and 'yes' on aid to El Salvador
X_example = {
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # 'no'
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,       # 'yes'
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Summary:**

- The function `predict` follows the decision tree provided with a maximum depth of 2.
- It uses the most significant features:
  - `"physician-fee-freeze"`
  - `"el-salvador-adi"`
- It returns the predicted party affiliation and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` includes all the feature keys with correct encodings.
- The feature `"el-salvador-adi"` is used as provided in your feature list. If this is a typo and should be `"el-salvador-aid"`, please adjust accordingly.
