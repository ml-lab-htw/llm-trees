Certainly! Based on the specified features, encodings, and the decision tree provided earlier, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*4
    # Node 0: Check if 'physician-fee-freeze' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)
    # Node 1: Check if 'el-salvador-adi' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[1] = int(X['el-salvador-adi'] == 2)
    # Node 2: Check if 'education-spending' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[2] = int(X['education-spending'] == 2)
    # Node 3: Check if 'crime' vote is 'yes' (2)
    nodes[3] = int(X['crime'] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If 'physician-fee-freeze' is 'yes'
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If 'el-salvador-adi' is 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If 'education-spending' is 'yes'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    # If 'crime' is 'yes'
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Checks:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the congressperson voted 'yes' on the **physician fee freeze** (`X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2`).
  - **Node 1:** Checks if they voted 'yes' on **aid to El Salvador** (`X['el-salvador-adi'] == 2`).
  - **Node 2:** Checks if they voted 'yes' on **education spending** (`X['education-spending'] == 2`).
  - **Node 3:** Checks if they voted 'yes' on **crime** legislation (`X['crime'] == 2`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - Contains integer values `1` if the condition is satisfied (i.e., voted 'yes'), or `0` if not (voted 'no').

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If **Node 0** condition is satisfied (voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze), predict **Republican** (`1`).
  - Else, check **Node 1**. If satisfied, predict **Republican** (`1`).
  - Else, check **Node 2**. If satisfied, predict **Democrat** (`0`).
  - Else, check **Node 3**. If satisfied, predict **Republican** (`1`).
  - If none of the above conditions are satisfied, predict **Democrat** (`0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a congressperson with the following votes:

```python
congressperson_vote = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,           # Voted 'no'
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,                # Voted 'no'
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,             # Voted 'yes'
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,                          # Voted 'no'
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}
```

Predicting:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(congressperson_vote)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0, 0, 1, 0]
```

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - **Node 0:** `0` (Voted 'no' on physician fee freeze)
  - **Node 1:** `0` (Voted 'no' on aid to El Salvador)
  - **Node 2:** `1` (Voted 'yes' on education spending)
  - **Node 3:** `0` (Voted 'no' on crime legislation)

Since **Node 2** is satisfied, the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).

**Note on Feature Key Spelling:**

Please ensure that the feature keys in your input dictionary `X` match exactly with the given keys:

- `'physician-fee-freeze'`
- `'el-salvador-adi'` *(Assuming `'el-salvador-adi'` is correctly spelled in your dataset)*
- `'education-spending'`
- `'crime'`

**Important:** The values for each feature should be:

- `2` for **'yes'**
- `1` for **'no'**

This function encapsulates the decision tree logic and provides both the prediction and the evaluation of inner nodes, as requested.
