    else: # Voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]: # Voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1 # Republican (Possibly a more hawkish Democrat, but Republican more likely)

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with actual logic based on the vote values (2 for yes, 1 for no). We assume Republicans are more likely to vote "yes" on both the physician fee freeze and aid to the Contras.

2. **Clearer Logic:**  The code now directly reflects the hypothetical decision tree structure outlined previously.

3. **Feature Encoding:**  The code uses the provided feature encoding (2 for yes, 1 for no) directly.

4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list now accurately tracks the truth values (1 if the condition is met, 0 otherwise) of the inner nodes. This is useful for understanding the path taken through the tree.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_voter = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Yes
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,  # Yes
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [True, True] (Both conditions met)


example_voter2 = { 'physician-fee-freeze': 1, 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1, **{key: 1 for key in example_voter if key not in ['physician-fee-freeze', 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras']}}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_voter2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [False, False]


```


This improved function is more robust, easier to understand, and directly implements the decision tree logic. Remember, this example is still hypothetical.  A real-world implementation would involve training a decision tree model on actual data.
