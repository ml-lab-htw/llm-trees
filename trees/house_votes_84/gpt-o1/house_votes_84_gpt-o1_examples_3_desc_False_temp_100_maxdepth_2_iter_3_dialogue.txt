Certainly! Below is the Python function representing the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the provided features and their encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # Condition: voted 'no' on physician fee freeze
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied (voted 'no'), predict Republican
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        nodes[1] = 0  # Node 1 not evaluated
    else:
        # If Node 0 condition is not satisfied (voted 'yes'), proceed to Node 1
        # Node 1: Vote on aid to El Salvador (1 = no, 2 = yes)
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # Condition: voted 'yes' on El Salvador aid
        # Both branches under Node 1 lead to Democrat
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    # Convert Boolean conditions to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [int(node) if node is not None else 0 for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the representative voted **'no'** (`1`) on the **physician fee freeze**.
  - `nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1`
- **Node 1:** (Evaluated only if Node 0 condition is not satisfied)
  - Checks if the representative voted **'yes'** (`2`) on **aid to El Salvador**.
  - `nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2`
- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is **True** (voted 'no' on physician fee freeze), predict **Republican** (`1`).
  - Else, predict **Democrat** (`0`), regardless of Node 1 outcome (included to maintain tree depth of 2).
- **Nodes List:**
  - Contains the truth values of the conditions (`1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).
  - `nodes[0]`: Indicates if the representative voted 'no' on physician fee freeze.
  - `nodes[1]`: Indicates if the representative voted 'yes' on aid to El Salvador (only meaningful if `nodes[0]` is `0`).

**Feature Encodings:**

- **Votes:**
  - `2` = **Yes**
  - `1` = **No**
- **Target Variable (party affiliation):**
  - `1` = **Republican**
  - `0` = **Democrat**

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # Voted 'no'
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,       # Voted 'yes'
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Interpret prediction
party = 'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'

# Output results
print(f"Prediction (party affiliation): {party}")
print(f"Node evaluations: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (party affiliation): Republican
Node evaluations: [1, 0]
```

**Explanation of Output:**

- **Node Evaluations:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: The representative voted **'no'** on physician fee freeze.
  - `nodes[1] = 0`: Node 1 was not evaluated (set to `0`).
- **Prediction:** Based on the decision tree, since `nodes[0] = 1`, the representative is predicted to be a **Republican**.

**Notes:**

- The function follows the required format, returning:
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).
  - `nodes`: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).
- The decision tree uses the most important features as determined, complying with a maximum depth of **2**.
- Placeholders for thresholds are filled with meaningful values based on the provided feature encodings.

- **Target Variable:**
  - **'party affiliation'**: Indicates the political party.
    - `1` = **Republican**
    - `0` = **Democrat**

**Important:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys as specified, matching the spelling, capitalization, and hyphens.
- The feature values must adhere to the provided encodings for accurate predictions.

**Summary of Decision Tree Logic:**

1. **Node 0:** Check the vote on **physician fee freeze**.
   - If voted **'no'** (`1`):
     - Predict **Republican** (`1`).
   - Else:
     - Proceed to Node 1.
2. **Node 1:** Check the vote on **aid to El Salvador**.
   - Regardless of the vote (since both branches lead to Democrat), predict **Democrat** (`0`).
   - Node 1 is included to maintain the maximum depth of **2** as specified.

By following this function, you can classify the party affiliation based on voting records using the most significant features.
