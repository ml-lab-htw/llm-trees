Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on your specifications:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None, None]
    
    # Node 0: Test if 'physician-fee-freeze' vote is 'yes' (2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)
    
    # Node 1: Test if 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' vote is 'yes' (2 = yes)
    nodes[1] = int(X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2)
    
    # Node 2: Test if 'crime' vote is 'yes' (2 = yes)
    nodes[2] = int(X['crime'] == 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Node 2 condition is satisfied
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - All votes are encoded as `2` for 'yes' and `1` for 'no'.
  - The target variable `party affiliation` is encoded as `1` for 'Republican' and `0` for 'Democrat'.

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the vote on `'physician-fee-freeze'` is 'yes'.
    - If **yes** (condition satisfied), the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
    - If **no** (condition not satisfied), proceed to Node 1.
  - **Node 1:** Checks if the vote on `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'` is 'yes'.
    - If **yes**, the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).
    - If **no**, proceed to Node 2.
  - **Node 2:** Checks if the vote on `'crime'` is 'yes'.
    - If **yes**, the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
    - If **no**, the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents whether the condition at Node 0 is satisfied (`1` if true, `0` if false).
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the condition at Node 1.
  - `nodes[2]`: Represents the condition at Node 2.
  - These nodes are evaluated at the beginning and used in the decision-making process.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where all votes are 'yes' (2)
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 1, 1]
```

**Note:** Make sure that when you use this function, the input dictionary `X` contains all the features with the exact keys as specified, and the values are encoded as per the feature descriptions.
