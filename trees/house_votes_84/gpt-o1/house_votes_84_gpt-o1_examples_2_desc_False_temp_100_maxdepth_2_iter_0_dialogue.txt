Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check 'physician-fee-freeze' vote
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)  # 2 = 'yes'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze, predict Republican
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Check 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' vote
        nodes[1] = int(X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2)  # 2 = 'yes'
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If voted 'yes' on budget resolution, predict Republican
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Else, predict Democrat
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` of length 2 to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the outcome of the first condition.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the outcome of the second condition (if reached).

- **First Condition (Node 0):** We check if the congressperson voted 'yes' on the **physician fee freeze**.
  - Since **2 = 'yes'** and **1 = 'no'**, the condition is `X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2`.
  - `nodes[0]` will be **1** if the condition is true, or **0** otherwise.

- **Second Condition (Node 1):** If the first condition is false (`nodes[0] == 0`), we check if they voted 'yes' on the **adoption of the budget resolution**.
  - The condition is `X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2`.
  - `nodes[1]` will be **1** if the condition is true, or **0** otherwise.

- **Predictions:**
  - If `nodes[0] == 1`, we predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If `nodes[0] == 0` and `nodes[1] == 1`, we predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If both `nodes[0] == 0` and `nodes[1] == 0`, we predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you might use the `predict` function with a sample input:

```python
# Sample input features
X_sample = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Node Truth Values: [0, 1]
```

- In this example, the individual did **not** vote 'yes' on the **physician fee freeze** (`nodes[0] == 0`) but **did** vote 'yes' on the **adoption of the budget resolution** (`nodes[1] == 1`), leading to a prediction of **Republican**.

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with the correct spelling and encoding as specified.
