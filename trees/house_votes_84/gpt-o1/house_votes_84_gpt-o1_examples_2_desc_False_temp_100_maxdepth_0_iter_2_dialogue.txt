Based on the provided decision tree and feature encodings, here is the Python function that returns the party affiliation prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on Physician Fee Freeze?
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # 2 = Yes, 1 = No

    # Node 1: Vote on Adoption of the Budget Resolution?
    nodes[1] = X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2  # 2 = Yes, 1 = No

    # Node 2: Vote on Aid to Nicaraguan Contras?
    nodes[2] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # 2 = Yes, 1 = No

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 is True (Voted Yes on Physician Fee Freeze)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # If Node 0 is False (Voted No on Physician Fee Freeze)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 is True (Voted Yes on Adoption of the Budget Resolution)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # If Node 1 is False (Voted No on Adoption of the Budget Resolution)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Node 2 is True (Voted Yes on Aid to Nicaraguan Contras)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                # If Node 2 is False (Voted No on Aid to Nicaraguan Contras)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes  # Return the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the vote on **physician-fee-freeze** is **Yes** (`2`).
- **nodes[1]:** If `nodes[0]` is `False`, checks if the vote on **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution** is **Yes** (`2`).
- **nodes[2]:** If `nodes[1]` is `False`, checks if the vote on **aid-to-nicaraguan-contras** is **Yes** (`2`).
- **Prediction:** Determines the party affiliation based on the decision tree logic.

**Features Used:**

- **physician-fee-freeze:** Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = Yes, 1 = No)
- **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution:** Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = Yes, 1 = No)
- **aid-to-nicaraguan-contras:** Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (2 = Yes, 1 = No)

**Target Variable:**

- **party affiliation:** (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)

**Example Usage:**

Let's test the function with a sample voting record.

```python
# Sample voting record
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
party = "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat"
print(f"Prediction (Party Affiliation): {party}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (Party Affiliation): Republican
Nodes Truth Values: [True, None, None]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0]:** `X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2` ➔ `2 == 2` ➔ `True`
- Since `nodes[0]` is `True`, the function predicts **Republican** without evaluating the other nodes.

---

**Another Example:**

```python
# Another voting record
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
party = "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat"
print(f"Prediction (Party Affiliation): {party}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (Party Affiliation): Democrat
Nodes Truth Values: [False, False, False]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0]:** `X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2` ➔ `1 == 2` ➔ `False`
- **nodes[1]:** `X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2` ➔ `1 == 2` ➔ `False`
- **nodes[2]:** `X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2` ➔ `1 == 2` ➔ `False`
- All nodes are `False`, so the function predicts **Democrat**.

---

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required feature keys with the correct encoding.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic provided.
- The list `nodes` corresponds to the truth values of the evaluated conditions (inner nodes).
  - `True` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `False` if the condition is not satisfied.
  - Conditions not evaluated remain `None`.

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- **Vote Values:**
  - `2` ➔ Yes
  - `1` ➔ No

**Feature Keys:**

```python
[
    'handicapped-infants',
    'water-project-cost-sharing',
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution',
    'physician-fee-freeze',
    'el-salvador-adi',
    'religious-groups-in-schools',
    'anti-satellite-test-ban',
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras',
    'mx-missile',
    'immigration',
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback',
    'education-spending',
    'superfund-right-to-sue',
    'crime',
    'duty-free-exports',
    'export-administration-act-south-africa'
]
```

By using this function, you can classify the party affiliation based on the most significant voting issues according to the decision tree.
