**Important Considerations:**

* **Real Data:** This function uses placeholder logic. You *must* replace the feature selection (`physician-fee-freeze`, `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras`) and the threshold values (== 2) with insights derived from analyzing your actual data.
* **Feature Importance:** Use a suitable method (e.g., information gain, Gini impurity) to identify the most important features for your decision tree.
* **Thresholds:** The `== 2` checks are examples.  You might need different comparisons depending on your data and the split points chosen by the decision tree algorithm.
* **Depth Limitation:** This function creates a tree of depth 2, as requested.  If you change the depth, you'll need to adjust the logic and `nodes` list accordingly.


This improved answer provides a functional Python code structure and emphasizes the crucial next step of using your real data to train a decision tree model and determine the best features and thresholds.  Once you have those, you can integrate them into this function.
