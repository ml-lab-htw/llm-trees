Certainly! Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the given features. The function returns a single prediction (`1` = Republican, `0` = Democrat) and a list representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)  # 1 if voted 'yes', 0 if 'no'
    nodes[1] = int(X['el-salvador-adi'] == 1)       # 1 if voted 'no', 0 if 'yes'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0** checks the vote on the **physician fee freeze**:
  - If a representative voted **'yes'** (encoded as `2`), `nodes[0]` is `1`.
  - If they voted **'yes'`, the prediction is **Republican** (`prediction = 1`), and the function returns.
- **Node 1** is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., the representative voted **'no'** on the physician fee freeze):
  - It checks the vote on **aid to El Salvador**.
    - If they voted **'no'** on aid to El Salvador (encoded as `1`), `nodes[1]` is `1`, and the prediction is **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If they voted **'yes'** (encoded as `2`), `nodes[1]` is `0`, and the prediction is **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).

### Usage Example:

Suppose we have a representative with the following voting record:

```python
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}
```

We can get the prediction and nodes as follows:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

### Breakdown:

- **physician-fee-freeze**: Voted **'no'** (`1`), so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- **el-salvador-adi**: Voted **'no'** (`1`), so `nodes[1] = 1`.
- Following the decision tree logic:
  - Since `nodes[0] = 0`, we proceed to check `nodes[1]`.
  - Since `nodes[1] = 1`, the prediction is **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

### Feature Keys and Encodings:

- **Feature Keys**:

  ```
  [
    'handicapped-infants', 
    'water-project-cost-sharing', 
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', 
    'physician-fee-freeze', 
    'el-salvador-adi', 
    'religious-groups-in-schools', 
    'anti-satellite-test-ban', 
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 
    'mx-missile', 
    'immigration', 
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback', 
    'education-spending', 
    'superfund-right-to-sue', 
    'crime', 
    'duty-free-exports', 
    'export-administration-act-south-africa'
  ]
  ```

- **Feature Encodings**:

  - Votes are encoded as:
    - `2` = **yes**
    - `1` = **no**

- **Target Variable**:

  - `party affiliation`: 
    - `1` = **Republican**
    - `0` = **Democrat**

### Node Conditions:

1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`):

   - Condition: `X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2`
   - Meaning: Checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is **'yes'**.
   
2. **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`):

   - Condition: `X['el-salvador-adi'] == 1`
   - Meaning: Checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is **'no'**.

### Decision Logic:

- If **Node 0** is `1` (condition satisfied):
  - Predict **Republican**.
- Else, check **Node 1**:
  - If **Node 1** is `1` (condition satisfied):
    - Predict **Democrat**.
  - Else:
    - Predict **Republican**.

### Summary:

This function implements the decision tree using the most significant features to classify the party affiliation based on voting patterns. It follows the structure:

- **Physician Fee Freeze Vote**:
  - **Yes** ➔ **Republican**
  - **No** ➔ Check **Aid to El Salvador Vote**:
    - **No** ➔ **Democrat**
    - **Yes** ➔ **Republican**
