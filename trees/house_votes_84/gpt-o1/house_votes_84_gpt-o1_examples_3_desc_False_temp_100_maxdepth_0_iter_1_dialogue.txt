Certainly! Based on the decision tree provided and the features with their exact keys and encodings, here's the Python function that returns a prediction of party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize a list of 3 elements for the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze? (yes / no)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)  # 1 if 'yes', 0 if 'no'

    if nodes[0]:
        # If the vote on physician fee freeze is 'yes'
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution? (yes / no)
        nodes[1] = int(X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2)  # 1 if 'yes', 0 if 'no'

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # Node 2: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras? (yes / no)
            nodes[2] = int(X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2)  # 1 if 'yes', 0 if 'no'

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Represents whether the condition at the root node is satisfied.
  - `nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)`
    - Checks if the member voted 'yes' (encoded as `2`) on the **physician fee freeze**.
    - If 'yes', `nodes[0]` is `1`; else, it's `0`.

- **nodes[1]:** Evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., member voted 'no' on physician fee freeze).
  - `nodes[1] = int(X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2)`
    - Checks if the member voted 'yes' on the **adoption of the budget resolution**.
    - If 'yes', `nodes[1]` is `1`; else, it's `0`.

- **nodes[2]:** Evaluated if both `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are `0`.
  - `nodes[2] = int(X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2)`
    - Checks if the member voted 'yes' on **aid to Nicaraguan contras**.
    - If 'yes', `nodes[2]` is `1`; else, it's `0`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat):", prediction)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with the correct encodings as specified. The function will return the predicted party affiliation and a list indicating which conditions were satisfied during the decision-making process.
