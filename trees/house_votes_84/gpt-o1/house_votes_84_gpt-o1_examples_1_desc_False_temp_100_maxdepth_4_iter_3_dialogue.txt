```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list of 4 None values for the nodes

    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)  # 1 if voted 'yes', 0 otherwise
    nodes[1] = int(X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2)  # 1 if voted 'yes', 0 otherwise
    nodes[2] = int(X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2)  # 1 if voted 'yes', 0 otherwise
    nodes[3] = int(X["duty-free-exports"] == 2)  # 1 if voted 'yes', 0 otherwise

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Voted 'yes' on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted 'no' on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Voted 'no' on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # Voted 'yes' on aid to El Salvador
            if nodes[3]:  # Voted 'yes' on duty-free exports
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Voted 'no' on duty-free exports
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Voted 'no' on aid to El Salvador
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the individual voted 'yes' (2) on the **physician-fee-freeze**.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the individual voted 'yes' (2) on the **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution**.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the individual voted 'yes' (2) on the **el-salvador-adi**.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the individual voted 'yes' (2) on the **duty-free-exports**.
  
- **Decision Logic:**
  - **Node 0 (Root Node):**
    - If `nodes[0]` is **1** (voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze):
      - Proceed to **Node 1**.
        - Regardless of the vote on **Node 1**, predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
    - Else (voted 'no' on physician fee freeze):
      - Proceed to **Node 2**.
        - If `nodes[2]` is **1** (voted 'yes' on aid to El Salvador):
          - Proceed to **Node 3**.
            - If `nodes[3]` is **1** (voted 'yes' on duty-free exports):
              - Predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
            - Else (voted 'no' on duty-free exports):
              - Predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
        - Else (voted 'no' on aid to El Salvador):
          - Predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a sample input:

```python
sample_input = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 1, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] = 1`: The individual voted 'yes' on physician fee freeze.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The individual voted 'yes' on adoption of the budget resolution.
- Since `nodes[0]` is **1**, the individual is predicted to be a **Republican**.

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - All voting features are encoded as **2 for 'yes'** and **1 for 'no'**.
- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - **1** represents **Republican**.
  - **0** represents **Democrat**.
- **Function Details:**
  - The function accepts a dictionary `X` containing the voting features with exact keys as provided.
  - It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes.
  - It evaluates each node's condition and updates the `nodes` list accordingly.
  - It uses nested `if` statements to traverse the decision tree and make a prediction.
  - It returns the `prediction` and the list of `nodes`.

**Feature Keys (Exact Spelling and Casing):**

- 'handicapped-infants'
- 'water-project-cost-sharing'
- 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'
- 'physician-fee-freeze'
- 'el-salvador-adi'
- 'religious-groups-in-schools'
- 'anti-satellite-test-ban'
- 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'
- 'mx-missile'
- 'immigration'
- 'synfuels-corporation-cutback'
- 'education-spending'
- 'superfund-right-to-sue'
- 'crime'
- 'duty-free-exports'
- 'export-administration-act-south-africa'

**Understanding the Decision Path:**

- The `nodes` list gives insight into which conditions were met (`1`) or not met (`0`).
- By examining the `nodes`, you can trace the path taken in the decision tree to arrive at the prediction.

**Important Considerations:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct values (either **1** or **2**).
- The function strictly relies on the specified feature encodings and keys.
- This simple decision tree classifier may not cover all possible cases in real-world data but provides a basic method for classification based on key voting features.
