Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the provided features. The function returns the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze? (2 = Yes)
    nodes[0] = int(X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the condition at Node 0 is satisfied (Yes), predict Republican
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution? (2 = Yes)
        nodes[1] = int(X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the condition at Node 1 is satisfied (Yes), predict Democrat
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 2: Vote on aid to El Salvador? (2 = Yes)
            nodes[2] = int(X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2)
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # If the condition at Node 2 is satisfied (Yes), predict Republican
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If none of the conditions are satisfied, predict Democrat
                prediction = 0
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Input:** The function `predict` accepts a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a single individual. Each key in `X` must match exactly one of the provided feature keys, and the values must follow the specified encoding (2 = Yes, 1 = No).

- **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list holds the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes in the decision tree. Each element corresponds to a decision point:
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents whether the individual voted "Yes" on the **physician-fee-freeze**.
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents whether the individual voted "Yes" on the **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution**.
  - `nodes[2]`: Represents whether the individual voted "Yes" on the **el-salvador-adi**.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **Node 0:** Checks if the individual voted "Yes" on the **physician-fee-freeze**.
    - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] == 1`):
      - Predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If **No** (`nodes[0] == 0`):
      - Proceed to **Node 1**.
  - **Node 1:** Checks if the individual voted "Yes" on the **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution**.
    - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] == 1`):
      - Predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
    - If **No** (`nodes[1] == 0`):
      - Proceed to **Node 2**.
  - **Node 2:** Checks if the individual voted "Yes" on the **el-salvador-adi**.
    - If **Yes** (`nodes[2] == 1`):
      - Predict **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If **No** (`nodes[2] == 0`):
      - Predict **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

- **Return Value:** The function returns a tuple containing:
  - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
  - `nodes`: A list of integers representing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

Make sure to use the exact keys and value encodings as specified:

- **Feature Keys:**

  ```python
  [
      'handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing',
      'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution', 'physician-fee-freeze',
      'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools',
      'anti-satellite-test-ban', 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 'mx-missile',
      'immigration', 'synfuels-corporation-cutback', 'education-spending',
      'superfund-right-to-sue', 'crime', 'duty-free-exports',
      'export-administration-act-south-africa'
  ]
  ```

- **Value Encoding:**
  - Votes are encoded as **2** for **Yes** and **1** for **No**.

**Example Usage:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function with an example input:

```python
# Example input features for an individual
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Predict party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the results
party = 'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'
print(f'Predicted Party Affiliation: {party}')
print(f'Inner Node Truth Values: {nodes}')
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Party Affiliation: Democrat
Inner Node Truth Values: [0, 1, 0]
```

**Explanation of the Example:**

- **Node 0:** `physician-fee-freeze` vote is **1** (No), so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- **Node 1:** `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution` vote is **2** (Yes), so `nodes[1] = 1`.
- Since `nodes[1]` is **1**, the prediction is **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure that all feature keys in the input dictionary `X` are spelled exactly as specified, including hyphens and lowercase letters.
- The votes must be encoded correctly: **2** for **Yes**, **1** for **No**.
- The nodes list reflects the truth values of the conditions in the order they are evaluated, with **1** indicating the condition is satisfied and **0** indicating it is not.
- This function follows the decision tree logic provided and uses the most significant features to make an accurate prediction.
