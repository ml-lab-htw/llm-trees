Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 5  # Initialize the list to store truth values of the nodes

    # Node 0: Vote on 'physician-fee-freeze' == 2 (Yes)
    nodes[0] = int(X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2)

    if nodes[0]:  # If the vote on 'physician-fee-freeze' is Yes
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        nodes[1] = 0
        nodes[2] = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Vote on 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' == 2 (Yes)
        nodes[1] = int(X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 2)

        if nodes[1]:  # If the vote on 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' is Yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            nodes[2] = 0
        else:
            # Node 2: Vote on 'crime' == 2 (Yes)
            nodes[2] = int(X['crime'] == 2)

            if nodes[2]:  # If the vote on 'crime' is Yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Nodes[3] and Nodes[4] are not used in this tree
    nodes[3] = 0
    nodes[4] = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**
  - `nodes = [0] * 5` initializes a list to keep track of the truth values of the five nodes in the decision tree.
  
- **Node 0:** Checks if the representative voted **Yes** (`2`) on `'physician-fee-freeze'`.
  - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), the function predicts **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If **No** (`nodes[0] = 0`), it moves to Node 1.
  
- **Node 1:** Checks if the representative voted **Yes** (`2`) on `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`.
  - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), the function predicts **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If **No** (`nodes[1] = 0`), it moves to Node 2.
  
- **Node 2:** Checks if the representative voted **Yes** (`2`) on `'crime'`.
  - If **Yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`), the function predicts **Republican** (`prediction = 1`).
  - If **No** (`nodes[2] = 0`), the function predicts **Democrat** (`prediction = 0`).
  
- **Nodes 3 and 4:** These nodes are not used in this decision tree but are included to match the required maximum depth of 5. They are set to `0`.
  
- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the `prediction` (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list `nodes`, which contains the truth values of the conditions at each node.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a representative with the following votes:

```python
representative = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(representative)

print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1` indicates the representative voted **Yes** on `'physician-fee-freeze'`, leading to an immediate classification as **Republican**.
  - `nodes[1]` and `nodes[2]` are `0` because those conditions were not evaluated after the first decision.
  - `nodes[3]` and `nodes[4]` are `0` as they are placeholders to match the maximum depth requirement.

**Feature Key Reference:**

- `'physician-fee-freeze'`: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = Yes, 1 = No)
- `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = Yes, 1 = No)
- `'crime'`: Vote on crime (2 = Yes, 1 = No)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **1**: Republican
- **0**: Democrat

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct spelling and casing as provided.
- The votes should be encoded as **2 for Yes** and **1 for No** as specified.
