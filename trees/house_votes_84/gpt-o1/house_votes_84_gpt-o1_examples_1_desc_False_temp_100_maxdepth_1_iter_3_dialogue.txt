Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, using the most important feature to classify party affiliation (Democrat or Republican):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes, 1 = no

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `"physician-fee-freeze"`
- **Node Condition:** `nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2`
  - The condition checks if the vote on the physician fee freeze is **'Yes'** (encoded as `2`).
- **Prediction Encoding:**
  - `prediction = 1` corresponds to **Republican**.
  - `prediction = 0` corresponds to **Democrat**.
- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes` is a list representing the truth value of the inner node conditions.
  - Since the decision tree has a maximum depth of 1, there is only one inner node (`nodes[0]`).
  - `nodes[0]` is `True` if the condition is satisfied (voted 'Yes'), and `False` otherwise.

**Usage Example:**

Let's consider an example input to see how the function works.

```python
# Sample input features
X_sample = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,  # Voted 'Yes' on physician fee freeze
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Calling the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

# Output the results
party = 'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'
print(f"Prediction: {party}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [True]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- `nodes[0]` is `True` because `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2` (the vote was 'Yes').
- Since `nodes[0]` is `True`, the function predicts `1`, which corresponds to **Republican**.

**Note on Placeholders and Thresholds:**

- There are no placeholders for thresholds in this function since the feature used is categorical with known encoding (`2` for 'Yes' and `1` for 'No').
- The condition directly checks for equality with the encoded value representing a 'Yes' vote.

**List of Features (Keys):**

```python
[
    'handicapped-infants',
    'water-project-cost-sharing',
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution',
    'physician-fee-freeze',
    'el-salvador-adi',
    'religious-groups-in-schools',
    'anti-satellite-test-ban',
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras',
    'mx-missile',
    'immigration',
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback',
    'education-spending',
    'superfund-right-to-sue',
    'crime',
    'duty-free-exports',
    'export-administration-act-south-africa'
]
```

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `party affiliation`: `1` for **Republican**, `0` for **Democrat**.

**Feature Description and Encoding:**

- Each feature represents a vote on a specific issue.
- Votes are encoded as:
  - `2` for **Yes**
  - `1` for **No**

**Summary:**

The function `predict` uses the most informative feature (`"physician-fee-freeze"`) to classify the party affiliation. It checks whether the vote on the physician fee freeze was 'Yes' or 'No' and predicts accordingly:

- **Voted 'Yes' (2):** Predict **Republican** (`1`)
- **Voted 'No' (1):** Predict **Democrat** (`0`)

This simple decision tree provides a straightforward way to classify members based on their voting record on a key issue.
