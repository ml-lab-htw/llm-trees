Certainly! Based on the decision tree constructed earlier and following your instructions, here is the Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - `"physician-fee-freeze"`: (2 = yes, 1 = no)
  - `"el-salvador-adi"`: (2 = yes, 1 = no)
- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `party affiliation`: (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)

**Function Details:**

- **Input:** A dictionary `X` containing the features with exact keys as provided.
- **Nodes List:** Represents the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - `nodes[0]` checks if the vote on the physician fee freeze is **Yes** (i.e., equal to 2).
  - `nodes[1]` checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is **Yes** (i.e., equal to 2).
- **Decision Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (feature condition satisfied), predict **Republican** (`1`).
  - Else, check `nodes[1]`:
    - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, predict **Democrat** (`0`).
    - Else, predict **Republican** (`1`).
- **Output:**
  - `prediction`: The class prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat).
  - `nodes`: A list of integers representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This will output:

```
Prediction: Republican
Nodes: [1, 0]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correct encodings as specified.
