Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree function that implements my previous tree structure:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # physician-fee-freeze: 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # checking if vote is "no"
    # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras: 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # checking if vote is "no"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if "no" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if "no" on contra aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if "yes" on contra aid
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if "yes" on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting record
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is "no" (≤ 1)
4. Checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "no" (≤ 1)
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each condition

The thresholds are set to 1 because according to the feature encoding:
- A value of 1 means "no"
- A value of 2 means "yes"
So "≤ 1" effectively checks for a "no" vote.
