Based on the provided decision tree and feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Converting the yes/no votes (2/1) to binary conditions (True/False)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5        # First split
    nodes[1] = X["water-project-cost-sharing"] <= 1.5  # Second split (left branch)
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5   # Second split (right branch)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5 (voted no)
        if nodes[1]:  # water-project-cost-sharing <= 1.5 (voted no)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # water-project-cost-sharing > 1.5 (voted yes)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze > 1.5 (voted yes)
        if nodes[2]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras <= 1.5 (voted no)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras > 1.5 (voted yes)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the binary decisions
3. Uses 1.5 as the threshold since the votes are encoded as 1 (no) and 2 (yes)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node decisions
5. Makes decisions based on key votes that were typically split along party lines:
   - Physician fee freeze
   - Water project cost sharing
   - Aid to Nicaraguan contras

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because:
- Values <= 1.5 capture "no" votes (
