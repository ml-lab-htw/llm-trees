I'll create a similar function for the congressional voting decision tree, using the exact feature names and encodings provided. Based on the encoding where 2=yes and 1=no for votes, I'll adjust the thresholds accordingly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on physician-fee-freeze (1=no, 2=yes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # splits between no (1) and yes (2)
    
    # Second split on education-spending (1=no, 2=yes)
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5    # splits between no (1) and yes (2)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # education-spending is "no" (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "yes" (2)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean results of each split
3. Makes decisions based on two key votes:
   - First split on physician-fee-freeze (threshold 1.5 separates "no"=1 from "yes"=2)
   - Second split on education-spending (threshold 1.5 separates "no"=1 from "yes"=2)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Republicans are more likely to vote "no" on both physician fee freeze and education spending
- Democrats are more likely to vote "yes" on education spending and physician fee freeze
