Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the information you've provided, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function:

1. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (since our tree has a depth of 2).

2. The first node checks if the vote on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is yes (2).

3. The second node checks if the vote on "education-spending" is yes (2).

4. The prediction is made based on these votes:
   - If "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is yes, predict Republican (1).
   - If "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is no and "education-spending" is yes, predict Democrat (0).
   - If "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is no and "education-spending" is no, predict Republican (1).

5. The function returns the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the format you requested, using the correct feature keys and encoding for votes (2 = yes, 1 = no) and party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
