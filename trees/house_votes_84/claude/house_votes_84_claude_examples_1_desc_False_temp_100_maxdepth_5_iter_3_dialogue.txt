Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function. I'll use the key voting features from my previous tree and adjust the thresholds according to the actual feature encoding (where 2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Converting the conditions to match the feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5      # Split on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5 # Split on Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5        # Split on education spending
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5  # Split on budget
    nodes[4] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5          # Split on El Salvador aid

    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # aid to contras is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to contras is "yes"
            if nodes[2]:  # education spending is "no"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending is "yes"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze is "yes"
        if nodes[3]:  # budget resolution is "no"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution is "yes"
            if nodes[4]:  # El Salvador aid is "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # El Salvador aid is "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree classifier:
1. Uses the actual feature names from the provided list
2. Accounts for the binary encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no) by using 1.5 as the threshold
3. Returns predictions matching the target encoding (1 = Republican
