Based on the decision tree I previously described and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (as our tree has a depth of 2) to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is yes (2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is yes (2).

5. If the vote on Nicaraguan contras aid is yes, we predict Republican (1).

6. If the vote on Nicaraguan contras aid is no, we check the physician fee freeze vote:
   - If it's yes, we predict Republican (1).
   - If it's no, we predict Democrat (0).

7. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the decision tree structure we discussed earlier, using the exact feature keys provided and the correct encoding for votes (2 for yes, 1 for no) and party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
