Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no in the voting data
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5    # Split between yes/no
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # education-spending is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending is 'yes'
            if X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5:  # adi is 'no'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'yes'
        if nodes[2]:  # budget-resolution is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget-resolution is 'yes'
            if nodes[3]:  # nicaraguan-contras-aid is 'no'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # nicaraguan-contras-aid is 'yes'
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the correct feature names as provided in the keys
2. Accounts for the binary voting system (2 = yes, 1 = no) by using 1.5 as the threshold
3. Returns both the prediction (1 for
