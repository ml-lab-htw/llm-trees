Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the 'physician-fee-freeze' and 'education-spending' features, where both features use the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5 (effectively checking if it's 'no' (1))
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second node: education-spending <= 1.5 (effectively checking if it's 'no' (1))
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if physician-fee-freeze is 'no' (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # if education-spending is 'no' (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # if education-spending is 'yes' (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # if physician-fee-freeze is 'yes' (2)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the threshold of 1.5 to effectively split between 'no' (1) and 'yes' (2) votes
2. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions
3. Follows the logic:
   - If voted no on physician fee freeze and no on education spending → Republican
   - If voted no on physician fee freeze but yes on education spending → Democrat
   - If voted yes on physician fee freeze → Democrat
4. The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds (1.5) are chosen because the features are encoded as 1 (no) and 2 (yes), so 1.5 is the natural splitting point between these values.
