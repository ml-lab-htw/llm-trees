Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. I'll use the same structure as my previous tree but adjust it for the correct feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    # Note: in the data, 2 = yes, 1 = no
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'yes'
            if X["education-spending"] <= 1.5:  # education-spending is 'no'
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'yes'
        if nodes[2]:  # budget resolution is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution is 'yes'
            if nodes[3]:  # el-salvador-aid is 'no'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Uses thresholds of 1.5 to split between 'yes' (2) and 'no' (1) votes
3. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) an
