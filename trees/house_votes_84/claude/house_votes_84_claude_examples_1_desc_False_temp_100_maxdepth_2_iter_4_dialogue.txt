Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, adjusting it to use the correct feature names and value encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1
    
    # Second split on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # if yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # if yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting records
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Makes decisions based on two key votes:
   - physician-fee-freeze (first split)
   - education-spending (second split)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The logic reflects typical party positions where:
- Republicans are more likely to vote no on both physician fee freeze and education spending
- Democrats are more likely to vote yes on education spending and/or physician fee freeze
