Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, adjusting for the actual feature encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions to match the encoding where 2=yes, 1=no
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1    # Check if voted "no" on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1    # Check if voted "no" on aid to contras
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if voted "no" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if voted "no" on aid to contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if voted "yes" on aid to contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if voted "yes" on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting record
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates two key votes:
   - physician-fee-freeze
   - aid-to-nicaraguan-contras
4. Returns both the predicted party (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node decisions

The thresholds are set to 1 because in the encoding scheme, 1 = "no" and 2 = "yes", so "<=1" checks for "no" votes.
