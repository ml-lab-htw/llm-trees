Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[4] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # yes

    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze == yes
        if nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # education-spending == yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze == no
        if nodes[3]:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[4]:  # mx-missile == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:

1. The predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the exact feature keys you provided and considers the encoding where 2 represents "yes" and 1 represents "no" for the voting features.

The decision tree structure follows the one I described earlier, using the most likely important features to classify party affiliation. It starts with the vote on physician fee freeze and then branches based on other key issues that tend to divide along party lines.

Remember that this is a simplified model and real-world political affiliations can be more complex. The actual
