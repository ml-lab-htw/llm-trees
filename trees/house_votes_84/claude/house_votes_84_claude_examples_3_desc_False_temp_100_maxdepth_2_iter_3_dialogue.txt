Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is 1 (no). If it's 1 or less, `nodes[0]` is True.

4. The second node checks if the vote on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is 1 (no). If it's 1 or less, `nodes[1]` is True.

5. The prediction logic follows the decision tree:
   - If the vote on physician fee freeze is "no" (≤ 1) and the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "no" (≤ 1), predict Democrat (0).
   - If the vote on physician fee freeze is "no" (≤ 1) and the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "yes" (> 1), predict Republican (1).
   - If the vote on physician fee freeze is "yes" (> 1), predict Republican (1).

6. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the examples you provided, using the correct feature names and encodings as specified in your instructions.
