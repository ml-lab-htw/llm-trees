Based on the given decision tree and the feature descriptions, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first condition checks if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is 2 (yes). If true, it classifies as Republican (1).

4. If the first condition is false, we check the vote on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras". If it's 2 (yes), we classify as Republican (1).

5. If both conditions are false, we classify as Democrat (0).

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the decision tree structure we discussed earlier, using the correct feature names and encoding as provided in the description. The tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the two most discriminative features to classify party affiliation.
