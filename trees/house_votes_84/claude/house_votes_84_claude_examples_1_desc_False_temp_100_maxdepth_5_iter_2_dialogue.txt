Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node truth values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Converting the yes/no votes (2=yes, 1=no) to binary (True if yes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["superfund-right-to-sue"] == 2

    if not nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is no
        if not nodes[1]:  # budget resolution is no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution is yes
            if not nodes[2]:  # education spending is no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending is yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is yes
        if not nodes[3]:  # aid to contras is no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to contras is yes
            if not nodes[2]:  # education spending is no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending is yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the physician fee freeze vote
2. Then branches based on budget resolution or aid to Nicaraguan contras
3. Uses education spending as a final discriminator
4. Includes superfund-right-to-sue as the fifth node (though not used in the actual decision making to keep the tree simple)

The function returns:
- A prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
- A list of 5 boolean values representing whether each condition was met

Key voting patterns:
- Republicans typically voted no on physician fee freeze
-
