Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: physician-fee-freeze check (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5
    
    # Node 1: aid-to-nicaraguan-contras check (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "no" (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "yes" (2)
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses 1.5 as the threshold since the features are encoded as 1 (no) and 2 (yes)
2. Returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
3. Follows the same tree structure as previously described:
   - First split on physician-fee-freeze
   - Second split (only if physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5) on aid-to-nicaraguan-contras
4. Makes predictions based on historical voting patterns where:
   - Republicans typically supported physician fee freeze
   - Among those who opposed physician fee freeze, support for Nicaraguan contras aid typically indicated Republican affiliation
   - Opposition to both typically indicated Democratic affiliation
