Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # yes
    nodes[4] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # yes

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree we discussed earlier, with the following key points:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. Each node checks if a particular vote is "yes" (2).

4. The tree structure follows the logic we outlined earlier, classifying into Republican (1) or Democrat (0) based on the voting patterns.

5. The function returns both the prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation adheres to the provided feature keys and encoding, and follows the structure of the example functions you provided. It uses the most discriminative features we identified earlier to classify party affiliation.
