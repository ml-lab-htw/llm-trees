Based on the provided features and target encoding, here's the decision tree function that classifies party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Converting the yes/no votes (2/1) to binary (1/0) for easier threshold comparison
    nodes[0] = (X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1)  # no vote
    nodes[1] = (X["water-project-cost-sharing"] == 1)  # no vote
    nodes[2] = (X["education-spending"] == 1)  # no vote
    nodes[3] = (X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1)  # no vote
    nodes[4] = (X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1)  # no vote

    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[1]:  # water project cost sharing = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # water project cost sharing = yes
            if nodes[2]:  # education spending = no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending = yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[3]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = yes
            if nodes[4]:  # budget resolution = no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # budget resolution = yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes representing the decision points
3. Converts the yes/no votes (2/1) to binary decisions (0/1) for easier comparison
4. Uses key voting patterns to classify party affiliation:
   - Physician fee freeze
   - Water project cost sharing
   - Education spending
   - Aid to Nicaraguan contras
   - Budget resolution
5. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
