Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. I'll use the key voting issues from my previous tree and adjust them according to the actual feature encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no for all votes
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2    # yes vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote on Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # yes vote on budget resolution

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending = yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # education spending = no
            if nodes[2]:  # aid to Nicaraguan contras = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[3]:  # budget resolution = yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # aid to Nicaraguan contras = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes representing the key decision points
3. Uses the actual feature encodings (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node conditions
5. Focuses on four key voting issues that typically divided along party lines:
   - Physician fee freeze
