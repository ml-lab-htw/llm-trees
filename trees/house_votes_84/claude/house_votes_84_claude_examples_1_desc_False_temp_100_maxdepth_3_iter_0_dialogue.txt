Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree classifier as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Converting the yes/no votes (2/1) to binary (1/0) for easier threshold comparison
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # No vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["water-project-cost-sharing"] <= 1.5  # No vote on water project
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5  # No vote on Nicaraguan aid
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If no on water project
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If yes on water project
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # If no on Nicaraguan aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If yes on Nicaraguan aid
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys as provided
2. Accounts for the feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
3. Returns the correct target encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node results

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because:
- Values â‰¤ 1.5 correspond to "no" votes (1 in the original encoding)
- Values > 1.5 correspond to "yes" votes (2 in the original encoding)

The logic follows the decision tree structure from earlier, where:
- The first split is on the physician fee freeze vote
- The second split for those voting no on fee freeze is based on water project cost sharing
- The third split for those voting yes on fee freeze is based on aid to Nicaraguan contras
