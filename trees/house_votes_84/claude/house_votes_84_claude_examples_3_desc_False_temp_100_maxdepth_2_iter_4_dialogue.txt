Based on the provided information and the decision tree I created earlier, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Since our tree has a depth of 2, we need 2 nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is yes (2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is yes (2).

5. If the vote on physician fee freeze is yes, we predict Republican (1).

6. If the vote on physician fee freeze is no, we check the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras:
   - If it's yes, we predict Republican (1).
   - If it's no, we predict Democrat (0).

7. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the provided feature keys, target variable encoding, and feature descriptions. It uses the most important features as determined in the previous step to classify party affiliation with a maximum depth of 2.
