Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Second node: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'yes' (2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'yes' (2).

5. It then uses these conditions to determine the prediction:
   - If the vote on Nicaraguan contras is 'yes', it predicts Republican (1).
   - If the vote on Nicaraguan contras is 'no', it checks the vote on physician fee freeze:
     - If it's 'yes', it predicts Republican (1).
     - If it's 'no', it predicts Democrat (0).

6. Finally, it returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This function accurately represents the decision tree I described earlier, using the correct feature keys and encodings you provided.
