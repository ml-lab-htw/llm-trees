Based on the provided information and the decision tree I created earlier, I'll now format it as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. I'll use the exact feature keys you provided and adjust the decision tree accordingly.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    nodes[3] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. Each node condition checks if the vote on a particular issue is 'yes' (2).

4. The decision tree structure is implemented using nested if-else statements.

5. The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This function captures the essence of the decision tree we created earlier, using the most likely important features for party classification. It's a simplified model and may not capture all the nuances of real-world voting patterns, but it should provide a reasonable classification based on the given voting record.
