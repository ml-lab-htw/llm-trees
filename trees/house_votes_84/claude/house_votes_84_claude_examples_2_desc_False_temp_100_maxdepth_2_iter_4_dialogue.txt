Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that predicts party affiliation and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Second node: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'yes' (encoded as 2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'yes' (encoded as 2).

5. The prediction logic follows the decision tree:
   - If aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'yes', predict Republican (1).
   - If aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'no':
     - If physician fee freeze is 'yes', predict Democrat (0).
     - If physician fee freeze is 'no', predict Republican (1).

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This function implements the decision tree we created earlier, using the correct feature names and encodings as provided in the instructions.
