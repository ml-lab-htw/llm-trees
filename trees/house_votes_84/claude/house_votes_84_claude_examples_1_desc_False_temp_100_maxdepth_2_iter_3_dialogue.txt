Based on the provided feature names and their encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Converting the thresholds based on the actual encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # Check if voted "no"
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # Check if voted "no"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted "no" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted "no" on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If voted "yes" on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If voted "yes" on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates whether the votes are "no" (≤ 1) for both key issues
4. Returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node truth values

The thresholds are set to 1 because in the encoding scheme:
- 1 = "no" vote
- 2 = "yes" vote

So checking if a value is ≤ 1 is equivalent to checking for a "no" vote.
