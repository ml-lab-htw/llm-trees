Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation. I'll use the same structure as my previous tree but adjust it for the correct feature names and encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing the binary decisions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes using the correct feature names and encodings
    # Remember: 2 = yes, 1 = no for votes
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "no" (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "yes" (2)
            if X["education-spending"] <= 1.5:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "yes" (2)
        if nodes[2]:  # budget resolution is "no" (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution is "yes" (2)
            if nodes[3]:  # el-salvador-aid is "no" (1)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # el-salvador-aid is "yes" (2)
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Uses the correct feature names from the provided list
3. Accounts for the binary encoding of votes (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns
