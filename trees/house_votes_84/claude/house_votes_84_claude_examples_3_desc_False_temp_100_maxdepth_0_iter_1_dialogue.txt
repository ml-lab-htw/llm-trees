Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the given feature descriptions, I'll create a Python function that predicts party affiliation and returns the truth values of the inner nodes. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[4] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze == yes
        if nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras == no
            if nodes[2]:  # education-spending == yes
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # education-spending == no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze == no
        if nodes[3]:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == no
            if nodes[4]:  # el-salvador-adi == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # el-salvador-adi == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the voting records as input. It returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree uses the following features as decision nodes:
1. Vote on physician fee freeze
2. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
3. Vote on education spending
4. Vote on
