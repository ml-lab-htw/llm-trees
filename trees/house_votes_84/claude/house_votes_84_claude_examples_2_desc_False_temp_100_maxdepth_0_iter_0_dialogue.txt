Based on the decision tree I previously created and the specific feature keys and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X['education-spending'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X['mx-missile'] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[4] = X['superfund-right-to-sue'] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:
1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
2. Vote on education spending
3. Vote on physician fee freeze
4. Vote on MX missile
5. Vote on superfund right to sue

Each node checks if the vote on the corresponding issue is "yes" (encoded as 2 in the provided feature description).

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I previously described, adjusted to match the specific encoding of the features and target variable you provided.
