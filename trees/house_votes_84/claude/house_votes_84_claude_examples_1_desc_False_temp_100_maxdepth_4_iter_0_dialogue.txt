Based on the provided feature encodings and target values, I'll create a decision tree function that classifies party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # No on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] > 1     # Yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # No on Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] > 1  # Yes on budget resolution

    if nodes[0]:  # No on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # Yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # No on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # No on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Yes on Nicaraguan contras
            if nodes[3]:  # Yes on budget resolution
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # No on budget resolution
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the four internal nodes
3. Evaluates each condition based on the feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node conditions

The decision paths follow typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats typically voted no on physician fee freeze, yes on education spending
- Republicans typically voted yes on physician fee freeze, yes on Nicaraguan contras, and had consistent voting patterns on budget resolution

The thresholds are set according to the feature encoding where 1 represents "no" and 2 represents
