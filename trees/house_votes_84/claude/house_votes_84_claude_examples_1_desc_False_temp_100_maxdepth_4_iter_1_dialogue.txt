Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that takes into account the binary nature of the votes (2 = yes, 1 = no) and the party affiliation encoding (1 = republican, 0 = democrat). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] > 1.5  # voting yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] > 1.5  # voting yes on Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] > 1.5  # voting yes on education spending
    nodes[3] = X["el-salvador-adi"] > 1.5  # voting yes on El Salvador aid

    if nodes[0]:  # yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[3]:  # yes on El Salvador aid
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # no on El Salvador aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # yes on Nicaraguan contras
            if nodes[2]:  # yes on education spending
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # no on education spending
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # no on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree classifier:
1. Uses the voting records with their proper encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
2. Returns party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat)
3. Returns the truth values of the inner nodes
4. Has a maximum depth of 4
5. Uses the most discriminative features that typically align with party positions:
   - Physician fee freeze
   - Aid to Nicaraguan contras
   - Education spending
   - El Salvador aid

The thresholds (1.5) are set to distinguish between 'yes'
