Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses 'physician-fee-freeze' and 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' as the key features. Since the votes are encoded as 2 = yes and 1 = no, I'll adjust the thresholds accordingly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5 (effectively checking if it's 'no' (1))
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second split: aid-to-nicaraguan-contras <= 1.5 (effectively checking if it's 'no' (1))
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if physician-fee-freeze is 'no' (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # if aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'no' (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'yes' (2)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if physician-fee-freeze is 'yes' (2)
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates whether the vote on physician-fee-freeze is 'no' (≤ 1.5)
4. If true, evaluates whether the vote on aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'no' (≤ 1.5)
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The thresholds of 1.5 are used because:
- Values of 1 (no) will be ≤ 1.5
- Values of 2 (yes)
