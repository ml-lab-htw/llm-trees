Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the given feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[4] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree uses the following features in order of importance:
1. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
2. Vote on education spending
3. Vote on physician fee freeze
4. Vote on anti-satellite test ban
5. Vote on MX missile

Each node checks if the vote on the corresponding issue is "yes" (encoded as 2 in the given feature description).

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier, adapted to the specific feature encodings and target variable encoding you specified.
