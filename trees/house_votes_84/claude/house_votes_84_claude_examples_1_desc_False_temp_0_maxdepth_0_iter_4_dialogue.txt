Based on the provided features and their encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. I'll use the most discriminative voting features from my previous tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no in the voting data
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # no on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2    # yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # no on budget resolution
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1  # no on aid to contras

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # no on budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # yes on budget resolution
            if nodes[3]:  # no on aid to contras
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # yes on aid to contras
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the node conditions
3. Evaluates four key voting patterns:
   - Vote on physician fee freeze
   - Vote on education spending
   - Vote on budget resolution
   - Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
4. Returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The tree structure reflects typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats were more likely to vote no on physician fee freeze and yes on education
