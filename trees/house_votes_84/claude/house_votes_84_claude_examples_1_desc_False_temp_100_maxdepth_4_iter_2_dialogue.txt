Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node truth values. I'll use the previously discussed structure but adjust it for the actual feature encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert the node conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5      # Split on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5  # Split on budget resolution
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5  # Split on Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[3] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5        # Split on education spending

    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # budget resolution is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution is 'yes'
            if nodes[3]:  # education spending is 'no'
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending is 'yes'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician fee freeze is 'yes'
        if nodes[2]:  # aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'yes'
            if nodes[3]:  # education spending is 'no'
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # education spending is 'yes'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the 4 inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition using the actual feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no, so we split
