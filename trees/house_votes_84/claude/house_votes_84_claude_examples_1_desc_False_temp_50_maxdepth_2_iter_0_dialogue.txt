Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function. I'll use the same features from my previous tree but adjust for the correct encoding (where 2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1    # Check if vote is "no"
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1    # Check if vote is "no"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if "no" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if "no" on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if "yes" on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree makes predictions based on two key votes:
1. The first split is on "physician-fee-freeze": A "no" vote (≤ 1) suggests Democrat
2. For those who voted "no" on physician fee freeze, we then look at "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": A "no" vote (≤ 1) strongly suggests Democrat, while a "yes" vote suggests Republican
3. Those who voted "yes" on physician fee freeze are classified as Republican

The function returns:
- prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
- nodes: A list of two boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

This matches the encoding where:
- Party affiliation: 1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat
- Votes: 2 = yes, 1 = no
