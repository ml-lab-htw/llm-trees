I'll create a Python function for the congressional voting decision tree that takes a dictionary of features and returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions. Based on the feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll adjust the thresholds accordingly.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing the condition results
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (2 = yes, 1 = no for all votes)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] > 1.5  # voting yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] > 1.5    # voting yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] > 1.5  # voting yes on Nicaraguan contras aid
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if not nodes[0]:  # voted no on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if not nodes[1]:  # voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # voted yes on education spending
            if not nodes[2]:  # voted no on Nicaraguan contras aid
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # voted yes on Nicaraguan contras aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of congressional votes as input
2. Evaluates three key votes:
   - Physician fee freeze
   - Education spending
   - Aid to Nicaraguan contras
3. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of three boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because:
- Votes are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no)
- 1.5 is the midpoint between these values
- X[feature] > 1.5 will be True for "yes" votes (
