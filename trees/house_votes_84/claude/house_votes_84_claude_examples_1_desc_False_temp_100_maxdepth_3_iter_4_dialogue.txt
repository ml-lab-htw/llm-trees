Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation using the three key voting features we identified. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Converting the conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # Is the vote "no"?
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # Is the vote "no"?
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] <= 1  # Is the vote "no"?
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if physician-fee-freeze is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # if aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if physician-fee-freeze is "yes"
        if nodes[2]:  # if education-spending is "no"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Uses the encoded values (2 = yes, 1 = no) to make comparisons
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node results

The decision logic follows these rules:
- If a representative votes "no" on physician fee freeze:
  - If they also vote "no" on Nicaraguan contra aid → Democrat
  - If they vote "yes" on Nicaraguan contra aid → Republican
- If a representative votes "yes" on physician fee freeze:
  - If they vote "no" on education spending → Republican
  - If they vote "yes" on education spending → Democrat
