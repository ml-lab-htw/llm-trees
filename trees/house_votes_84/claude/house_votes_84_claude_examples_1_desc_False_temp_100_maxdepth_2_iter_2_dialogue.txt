Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding (where 2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1    # Check if voted no
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1    # Check if voted no
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted no on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the voting record
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates the votes on "physician-fee-freeze" and "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were satisfied

The thresholds are set to 1 because in the provided encoding:
- 1 = no vote
- 2 = yes vote
So "<=1" checks if the vote was "no"
