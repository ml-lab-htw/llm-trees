Based on the provided features and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the 'physician-fee-freeze' feature as the splitting criterion. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between 'no' (1) and 'yes' (2)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5 (voted 'no')
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If physician-fee-freeze > 1.5 (voted 'yes')
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the decision node
3. Evaluates if 'physician-fee-freeze' is <= 1.5 (this threshold separates 'no' (1) from 'yes' (2) votes)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The threshold of 1.5 is chosen because:
- 'no' votes are encoded as 1
- 'yes' votes are encoded as 2
- 1.5 is the midpoint that separates these values
