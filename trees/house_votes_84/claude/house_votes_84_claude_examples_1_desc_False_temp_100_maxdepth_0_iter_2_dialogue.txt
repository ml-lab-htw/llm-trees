Based on the features and their encodings (2 = yes, 1 = no), I'll create a decision tree function that classifies party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2    # yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes on aid to contras
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # yes on budget resolution
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2:  # if yes on El Salvador aid
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # if no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # if yes on aid to contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # if yes on budget resolution
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of voting records as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates four key voting positions
4. Returns both the predicted party affiliation (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values

The tree uses voting patterns that typically distinguished Republicans from Democrats:
- Republicans were more likely to support physician fee freezes and aid to contras
- Democrats were more likely to support education spending and budget resolutions
- The El Salvador aid vote serves as a tie-breaker in one branch
