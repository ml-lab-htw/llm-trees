Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, adapting it to use the correct feature names and value ranges (where 2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # Check if voted no
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # Check if voted no
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted no on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If voted yes on Nicaraguan contras
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Uses the feature encoding where 2 = yes and 1 = no
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values
5. Makes decisions based on votes on physician fee freeze and aid to Nicaraguan contras

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats were more likely to vote no on physician fee freeze
- Among those who voted no on physician fee freeze, Republicans were more likely to support aid to Nicaraguan contras
