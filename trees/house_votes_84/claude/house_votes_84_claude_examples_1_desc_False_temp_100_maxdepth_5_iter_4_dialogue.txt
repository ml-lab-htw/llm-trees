Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. I'll use the same structure as my previous tree but adapt it to the correct feature names and encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Convert the conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes(2) and no(1)
    nodes[1] = X["water-project-cost-sharing"] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5
    nodes[4] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5

    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # water-project-cost-sharing is 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # water-project-cost-sharing is 'yes'
            if nodes[2]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'no'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is 'yes'
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'yes'
        if nodes[3]:  # education-spending is 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending is 'yes'
            if nodes[4]:  # el-salvador-aid is 'no'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # el-salvador-aid is 'yes'
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes representing the decision conditions
3. Uses the correct feature names
