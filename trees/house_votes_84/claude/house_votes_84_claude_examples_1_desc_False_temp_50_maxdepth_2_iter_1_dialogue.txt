Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree function that predicts party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Converting the yes/no votes (2=yes, 1=no) to match the tree thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no vote
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # 1 = no vote
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # if voted no on Nicaraguan contras aid
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if voted yes on Nicaraguan contras aid
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if voted yes on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates the vote on physician fee freeze (first split)
4. If the first vote is "no" (≤1), evaluates the vote on Nicaraguan contras aid
5. Makes predictions based on these votes:
   - No + No = Democrat (0)
   - No + Yes = Republican (1)
   - Yes + Any = Republican (1)
6. Returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values

The thresholds are set to 1 because in the feature encoding, 1 = no vote and 2 = yes vote, so "≤1" checks for "no" votes.
