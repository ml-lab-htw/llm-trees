Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation. I'll use the same structure as my previous tree but adapt it to the correct feature encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the three decision nodes
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to match the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1    # Check if voted no
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] > 1       # Check if voted yes
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] > 1  # Check if voted yes

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted no on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted yes on education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If voted no on education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If voted yes on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[2]:  # If voted yes on budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If voted no on budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three internal nodes
3. Evaluates three key votes:
   - physician-fee-freeze
   - education-spending
   - adoption-of-the-budget-resolution
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The tree uses the actual encoding where 2 = yes and 1 = no, so the conditions are adjusted accordingly. For example, "X['physician-fee-freeze'] <= 1" checks if the vote was "no" (1) rather than "yes" (2).

This decision tree captures key voting patterns that typically differentiate between Democrats and Republicans, focusing on healthcare (physician fee freeze), education spending, and fiscal policy (budget resolution).
