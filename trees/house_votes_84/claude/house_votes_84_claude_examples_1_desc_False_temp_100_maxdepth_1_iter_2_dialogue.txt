Based on the provided features and encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree that uses the 'physician-fee-freeze' feature as the splitting criterion. Since the encoding shows that 2 = yes and 1 = no, I'll use 1.5 as the splitting threshold.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # if <= 1.5 (meaning 1/no), then Democrat
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the decision node
3. Evaluates if the 'physician-fee-freeze' vote is <= 1.5 (effectively checking if it's 1/no)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat if the vote is "no" (1), 1 for Republican if the vote is "yes" (2)
   - nodes: a list containing the truth value of the decision node

The function implements the following logic:
- If physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5 (voted "no"), classify as Democrat (0)
- If physician-fee-freeze > 1.5 (voted "yes"), classify as Republican (1)
