Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. Each node condition checks if the vote on a particular issue is "yes" (encoded as 2).

4. The decision tree logic is implemented using nested if-else statements, following the structure of the tree we created earlier.

5. The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This implementation follows the decision tree we created earlier, using the most discriminative features to classify party affiliation. It takes into account the specific feature encodings provided (2 for yes, 1 for no) and the target encoding (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
