Based on the provided feature encoding and target values, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the three key voting issues I identified earlier, adapted to the exact feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store the decision path
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (using the correct feature names and encodings)
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no for votes
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes/no
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if not nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze = no (1)
        if not nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras = no (1)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras = yes (2)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze = yes (2)
        if nodes[2]:  # education-spending = no (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending = yes (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the physician fee freeze vote (threshold 1.5 splits between yes=2 and no=1)
2. Then checks aid to Nicaraguan contras or education spending depending on the first result
3. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - nodes: list of three boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The thresholds are set at 1.5 because the votes are encoded as 2 (yes) and 1 (no), so 1.5 is the natural splitting point between these values.

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats tend to vote no on physician fee
