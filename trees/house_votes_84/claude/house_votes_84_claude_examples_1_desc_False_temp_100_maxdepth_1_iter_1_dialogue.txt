Based on the decision tree I proposed and the feature encoding information you provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # physician-fee-freeze is encoded as 2=yes, 1=no
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # checking if the vote is "no"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if vote is "no" (<=1)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # if vote is "yes" (=2)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' of length 1 (since tree depth is 1)
3. Checks if the physician-fee-freeze vote is "no" (≤1) or "yes" (=2)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The prediction logic follows:
- If physician-fee-freeze ≤ 1 (voted "no"): predict Democrat (0)
- If physician-fee-freeze > 1 (voted "yes"): predict Republican (1)
