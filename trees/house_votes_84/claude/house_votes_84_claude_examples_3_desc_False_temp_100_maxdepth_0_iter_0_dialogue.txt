Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # yes vote
    nodes[3] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # yes vote

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. It evaluates each condition in the decision tree, storing the result (True or False) in the `nodes` list.

4. It then uses these evaluations to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction.

5. The function returns two things:
   - `prediction`: 1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
   - `nodes`: a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I described earlier, using the most likely important features to classify party affiliation. Remember that without actual data, this is an educated guess based on typical political alignments of the time.
