Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'] == 2  # yes
    nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 2  # yes
    nodes[2] = X['education-spending'] == 2  # yes
    nodes[3] = X['mx-missile'] == 2  # yes
    nodes[4] = X['anti-satellite-test-ban'] == 2  # yes

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 0  # Democrat
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the boolean results of each decision node.

3. It evaluates each decision node based on the voting record:
   - `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras`: yes vote (2) tends towards Republican
   - `physician-fee-freeze`: yes vote (2) tends towards Republican
   - `education-spending`: yes vote (2) tends towards Democrat
   - `mx-missile`: yes vote (2) tends towards Republican
   - `anti-satellite-test-ban`: yes vote (2) tends towards Democrat

4. It then follows the decision tree structure to make a prediction:
   - 1 represents Republican
   - 0 represents Democrat

5. Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of node results.

This implementation follows the structure of the
