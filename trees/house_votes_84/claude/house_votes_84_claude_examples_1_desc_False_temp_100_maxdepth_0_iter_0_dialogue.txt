Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the 4 decision nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (using the exact feature names and proper thresholds)
    # Note: 1 = no, 2 = yes in the original encoding
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1.5
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # education-spending is "no"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending is "yes"
            if nodes[2]:  # el-salvador-aid is "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # el-salvador-aid is "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "yes"
        if nodes[3]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Uses the exact feature names as provided
- Accounts for the encoding where 1 = no and 2 = yes for votes
- Returns both the prediction (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and the list of node conditions
- Uses logical thresholds of 1.5 to split between "yes" (2) and "no" (1) votes
- Makes decisions based on key voting patterns that typically differentiate between Democrats and Republicans

The tree first checks the physician fee freeze vote, then considers education spending, El Salvador aid,
