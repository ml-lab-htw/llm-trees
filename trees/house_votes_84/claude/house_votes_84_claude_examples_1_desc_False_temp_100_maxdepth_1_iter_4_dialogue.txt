Based on the provided features and encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the congressional voting decision tree using 'physician-fee-freeze' as the splitting criterion. Since the encoding uses 2 for 'yes' and 1 for 'no', I'll adjust the threshold accordingly:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # 1.5 as threshold between 1 (no) and 2 (yes)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if vote is "no" (1)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # if vote is "yes" (2)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (since depth=1)
3. Sets the node value based on the physician-fee-freeze vote (threshold 1.5 separates "no"=1 from "yes"=2)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the splitting condition

The threshold of 1.5 is chosen because:
- "no" votes are encoded as 1
- "yes" votes are encoded as 2
- 1.5 is the midpoint that separates these values
