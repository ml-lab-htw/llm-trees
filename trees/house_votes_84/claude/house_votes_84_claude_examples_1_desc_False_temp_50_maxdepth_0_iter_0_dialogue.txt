Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. I'll use the same structure as my previous tree but adapt it to the correct feature encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no in the voting features
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5    # Split between yes (2) and no (1)
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5  # Split between yes (2) and no (1)

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is "no" (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # education-spending is "no" (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "yes" (2)
        if nodes[2]:  # budget-resolution is "no" (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget-resolution is "yes" (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three decision nodes
3. Evaluates three key votes using thresholds of 1.5 (which splits between "yes" (2) and "no" (1) votes)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The tree uses these key voting patterns:
- Physician fee freeze: A "no" vote tends to indicate Democrat
- Education spending: Among those who voted "no" on
