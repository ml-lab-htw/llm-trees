Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function using the 'physician-fee-freeze' and 'education-spending' features, where both features use the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5 (equivalent to checking if the vote is 'no')
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5
    
    # Second split: education-spending <= 1.5 (equivalent to checking if the vote is 'no')
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'no' (1)
        if nodes[1]:  # education-spending is 'no' (1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education-spending is 'yes' (2)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is 'yes' (2)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the threshold of 1.5 to split between 'yes' (2) and 'no' (1) votes
2. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions
3. Follows the logic:
   - If voted no on physician fee freeze and no on education spending → Republican (1)
   - If voted no on physician fee freeze but yes on education spending → Democrat (0)
   - If voted yes on physician fee freeze → Democrat (0)

The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0) for the given input.
