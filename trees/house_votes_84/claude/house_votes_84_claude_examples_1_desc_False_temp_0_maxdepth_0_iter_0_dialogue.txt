Based on the provided features and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. I'll use the key voting issues from my previous tree and adjust for the actual feature encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes (using the encoding where 2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2    # yes vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # yes vote on budget
    nodes[3] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote on contra aid

    # Decision tree logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if not nodes[1]:  # education spending = no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending = yes
            if X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1:  # no on El Salvador aid
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if not nodes[2]:  # budget resolution = no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution = yes
            if not nodes[3]:  # contra aid = no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # contra aid = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of feature values as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of 4 key decision nodes
3. Evaluates each node condition based on the actual feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree uses key votes that typically divided along party lines:
