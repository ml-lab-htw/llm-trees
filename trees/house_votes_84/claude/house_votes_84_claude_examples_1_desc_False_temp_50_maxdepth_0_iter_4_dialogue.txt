Based on the provided feature encoding and target values, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes
    # Note: 2 = yes, 1 = no for all votes
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # no vote
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] <= 1    # no vote
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1  # no vote
    nodes[3] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1  # no vote

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze <= no
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending <= no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # education spending = yes
            if X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1:  # no vote
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[2]:  # budget resolution <= no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # budget resolution = yes
            if nodes[3]:  # el salvador aid <= no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes representing the key decision points
3. Uses the feature encoding where 2 = yes vote and 1 = no vote
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node conditions
5. Focuses on key voting issues that typically separate Republicans from Democrats:
   - Physician fee freeze
   - Education spending
   - Budget resolution
   - El Salvador aid
   - Aid to Nicaraguan contras

Each node condition returns True (1) if the condition is met an
