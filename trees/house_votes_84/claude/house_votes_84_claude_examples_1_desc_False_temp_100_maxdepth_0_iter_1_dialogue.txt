Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding (where 2 = yes, 1 = no for votes), I'll create a decision tree function that uses the most discriminating voting features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Converting the node conditions to match the 1/2 encoding
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] > 1.5  # votes yes on fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] > 1.5    # votes yes on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] > 1.5  # votes yes on budget
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the representative voted yes on physician fee freeze
2. Then checks either:
   - If they voted yes on the budget resolution (if first condition was true)
   - If they voted yes on education spending (if first condition was false)
3. Makes a prediction where:
   - 1 = Republican
   - 0 = Democrat

The logic follows typical party-line voting patterns where:
- Republicans typically support physician fee freezes and oppose education spending increases
- Democrats typically oppose physician fee freezes and support education spending and budget resolutions

The function returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the tree's internal nodes.
