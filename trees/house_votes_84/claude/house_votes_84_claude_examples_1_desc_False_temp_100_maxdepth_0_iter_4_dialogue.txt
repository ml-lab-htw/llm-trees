Based on the provided feature names and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node decisions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Converting the yes/no votes (2/1) to binary decisions (>1.5)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] > 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] > 1.5
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] > 1.5
    nodes[3] = X["el-salvador-adi"] > 1.5
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5
        if not nodes[1]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras <= 1.5
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras > 1.5
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze > 1.5
        if not nodes[2]:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution <= 1.5
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution > 1.5
            if not nodes[3]:  # el-salvador-adi <= 1.5
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # el-salvador-adi > 1.5
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the binary decisions at each node
3. Uses the voting thresholds (>1.5) to convert the yes/no votes (2/1) into binary decisions
4. Implements the decision tree logic
5. Returns both the prediction (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and the list of node decisions

The decision tree uses four key votes that were typically divisive along party lines:
- physician-fee-freeze
