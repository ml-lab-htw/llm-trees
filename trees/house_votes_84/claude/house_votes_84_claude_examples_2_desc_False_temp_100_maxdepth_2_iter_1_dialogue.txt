Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for party affiliation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    # Second node: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the votes (2 for yes, 1 for no).

2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is yes (2).

4. The second node checks if the vote on "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" is yes (2).

5. If the first condition is true (voted yes on physician fee freeze), it predicts Republican (1).

6. If the first condition is false, it checks the second condition:
   - If true (voted yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras), it predicts Republican (1).
   - If false, it predicts Democrat (0).

7. The function returns the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the decision tree structure I described earlier and uses the provided feature encodings (2 for yes, 1 for no) and target encoding (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat).
