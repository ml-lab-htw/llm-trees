Based on the provided feature names and encodings (where 2 = yes, 1 = no for votes), I'll create a decision tree prediction function that classifies party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to account for yes(2)/no(1) encoding
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # yes vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] == 2    # yes vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2  # yes vote on contra aid
    
    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2:  # yes on budget
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending = yes
            if nodes[2]:  # contra aid = yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks the physician fee freeze vote
2. Then checks education spending and budget resolution votes
3. Finally checks the aid to Nicaraguan contras vote in certain cases
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the status of the inner nodes

The logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats typically voted no on physician fee freeze, yes on education spending, no on contra aid
- Republicans typically voted yes on physician fee freeze, no on education spending, yes on contra aid
