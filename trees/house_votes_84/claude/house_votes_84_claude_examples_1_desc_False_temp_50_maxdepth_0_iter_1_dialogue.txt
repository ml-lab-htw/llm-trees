Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the most discriminative voting features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the three decision points
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes (using the actual feature encoding where 2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # First split on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] > 1     # Second split on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] > 1  # Third split on budget resolution

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze <= 1 (voted no)
        if nodes[1]:  # education-spending > 1 (voted yes)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # education-spending <= 1 (voted no)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze > 1 (voted yes)
        if nodes[2]:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution > 1 (voted yes)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution <= 1 (voted no)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the three decision nodes
3. Evaluates each condition using the actual feature encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and the list of node truth values

The decision tree logic follows typical voting patterns where:
- Democrats tend to vote no on physician fee freeze (≤1), yes on education spending (>1), and yes on budget resolution (>1)
- Republicans tend to vote yes on physician fee freeze (>1), no on education spending (≤1), and no on budget resolution (≤1)

The thresholds are
