Based on the provided features and encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts party affiliation (1 = republican, 0 = democrat) and returns the node conditions. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Converting the conditions based on the encoding (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] > 1.5  # yes vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["education-spending"] > 1.5    # yes vote on education spending
    nodes[2] = X["water-project-cost-sharing"] > 1.5  # yes vote on water project
    nodes[3] = X["el-salvador-adi"] > 1.5      # yes vote on El Salvador aid
    nodes[4] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] > 1.5  # yes vote on Nicaraguan contras

    if nodes[0]:  # physician fee freeze = yes
        if nodes[1]:  # education spending = yes
            if nodes[4]:  # aid to nicaraguan contras = yes
                prediction = 1  # republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # republican
    else:  # physician fee freeze = no
        if nodes[2]:  # water project = yes
            if nodes[3]:  # el salvador aid = yes
                prediction = 1  # republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # democrat
        else:
            prediction = 0  # democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 5 nodes representing the decision conditions
3. Uses the most discriminative voting issues as identified in the tree
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat) and the list of node conditions

The tree primarily uses votes on:
- Physician fee freeze
- Education spending
- Water project cost sharing
- El Salvador aid
- Aid to Nicaraguan contras

Each feature is encoded as 2
