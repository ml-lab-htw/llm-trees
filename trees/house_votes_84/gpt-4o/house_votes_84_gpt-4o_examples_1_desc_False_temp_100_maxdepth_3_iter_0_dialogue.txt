Using the given details about the features and structure of your decision tree, here is the implementation of the function to predict the party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and return the truth values for the inner tree nodes. I've selected thresholds to match those provided in your description.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List representing whether each condition at the inner nodes of the tree is satisfied
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # Physician fee freeze: no = Democrat
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] <= 1  # MX missile: no = Democrat
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Class: Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Class: Republican
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # Aid to Nicaraguan contras: no = Democrat
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Class: Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Class: Republican

    return prediction, nodes

# Example to test the function
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Predict for example
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction (party affiliation):", prediction)  # Output: Prediction (party affiliation): 0 or 1
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)  # Output: e.g., [True, True, ...]
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Tree structure**:  
   - **Node 0** checks the value of `"physician-fee-freeze"`. If the vote is "no" (value <= 1), it indicates Democrat; otherwise, continue splitting.  
   - **Node 1 onwards**: If `"physician-fee-freeze"` is "no" (Democrat), we move to check `"mx-missile"`. If `"mx-missile"` is "no" (value <= 1), predict Democrat; otherwise, Republican.  
   - If `"physician-fee-freeze"` is "yes" (Republican), check `"aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"`. If `"aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"` is "no", predict Democrat; otherwise, predict Republican.

2. **Node condition truth values**:
   - The function stores whether the condition of each decision node is satisfied (`True` or `False`) in the `nodes` list. This list helps track which conditions were evaluated and their outcomes.

3. **Example input**:
   - The input `X` is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a feature and each value represents the observed feature value for an individual.

4. **Outputs**:
   - `prediction`: The final class (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican).  
   - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing which conditions were satisfied at each step of the decision process.

By applying this function to new datasets with similar keys (feature names), you can predict the party affiliation and analyze the decision-making process.
