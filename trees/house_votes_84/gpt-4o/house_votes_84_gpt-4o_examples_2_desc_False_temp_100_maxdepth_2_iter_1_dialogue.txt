Sure! Based on your provided schema and format, I'll create a decision tree classifier function in Python that follows the indicated structure. The decision tree will use the votes on 'physician-fee-freeze' and 'el-salvador-adi' to predict the party affiliation.

Below is the implementation of the function.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First condition: check vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Second condition: check vote on aid to El Salvador
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2, 'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2, 'el-salvador-adi': 1, 'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1, 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1, 'mx-missile': 1, 
    'immigration': 1, 'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1, 'education-spending': 1, 
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1, 'crime': 1, 'duty-free-exports': 1, 
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output the prediction
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output the truth values of the inner nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **First Condition**: Checks if the vote on 'physician-fee-freeze' is 'yes' (2). If true, the prediction is a Democrat (0).
- **Second Condition**: If the first condition is false, it checks if the vote on 'el-salvador-adi' is 'yes' (2). If this is true, the prediction is a Republican (1). Otherwise, it's a Democrat (0).

This function takes in a dictionary `X` containing the input features, runs through the decision tree, and returns both the prediction and an array indicating which conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.
