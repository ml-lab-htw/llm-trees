Here is the Python function implementing a decision tree of depth 1 for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on the feature `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`. This function follows your specification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) based on voting on adoption of the budget resolution.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary with keys corresponding to feature names and values representing feature values.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted target class (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican).
        nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of nodes to store truth values
    nodes = [None]
    
    # Decision tree node: Check condition on adoption-of-the-budget-resolution
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # "2" means "yes"
    
    # Make predictions based on the node value
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted "yes"
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If voted "no"
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes Tracking**:
   - `nodes[0]` is `True` if the value for the feature `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"` equals `2` (a "yes" vote). It is `False` otherwise.
   - This logic implements a depth-1 decision tree with a single `if` condition.

2. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If the condition on `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"` is satisfied (voted "yes" ⇒ `nodes[0] = True`), classify as `Democrat` (target class `0`).
   - Otherwise (voted "no" ⇒ `nodes[0] = False`), classify as `Republican` (target class `1`).

3. **Inputs**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` that includes the key `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"`. The feature values are assumed to follow the provided encoding: `2` = "yes", `1` = "no".

4. **Outputs**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class, either `0` (Democrat) or `1` (Republican).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the decision at the inner node (single value, as it's depth-1).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary for a Republican
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,  # No
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (0=Democrat, 1=Republican):", prediction)
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

---

### Example Output:
If the input contains:
- `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1` ("no"), the person is predicted to be `Republican` (`1`), with node truth values `[False]`.

```
Prediction (0=Democrat, 1=Republican): 1
Node Truth Values: [False]
```

If the input contains:
- `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2` ("yes"), the person is predicted to be `Democrat` (`0`), with node truth values `[True]`.

```
Prediction (0=Democrat, 1=Republican): 0
Node Truth Values: [True]
```
