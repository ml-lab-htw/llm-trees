Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check "physician-fee-freeze" feature
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # "physician-fee-freeze" is no
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "physician-fee-freeze" is yes
        # Node 1: Check "el-salvador-adi" feature
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # "el-salvador-adi" is no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "el-salvador-adi" is yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician-fee-freeze"`, `"el-salvador-adi"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1`.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1`.
3. **Logic**:
   - If the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is "no" (`<= 1`), the prediction is Democrat (`0`).
   - Otherwise, if the vote on "physician-fee-freeze" is "yes" (`> 1`), the function checks the vote on "el-salvador-adi":
     - If the vote on "el-salvador-adi" is "no" (`<= 1`), the prediction is Democrat (`0`).
     - If the vote on "el-salvador-adi" is "yes" (`> 1`), the prediction is Republican (`1`).
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```

In this example:
- `"physician-fee-freeze"` is `2` (yes), so `nodes[0] = False`.
- `"el-salvador-adi"` is `1` (no), so `nodes[1] = True`.
- The final prediction is `0` (Democrat).
