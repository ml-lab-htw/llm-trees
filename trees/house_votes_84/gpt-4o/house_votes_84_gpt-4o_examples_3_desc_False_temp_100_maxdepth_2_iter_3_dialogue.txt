To match the format provided in the examples and build a decision tree classifier with the specifics given, we'll create a Python function that takes a dictionary representing the features as input and returns a prediction along with a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 2

    # Define the decision conditions (splits)
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
            
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Root Node:** The first condition checks the `Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras`. 
   - If the vote is `no` (encoded as 1), the function immediately predicts `Democrat` (encoded as 0).

2. **Second Level Node:** 
   - If the `aid to Nicaraguan contras` vote is `yes` (encoded as 2), the function then checks the `Vote on physician fee freeze`.
   - If this vote is also `yes` (encoded as 2), it predicts `Republican` (encoded as 1).
   - If this vote is `no` (encoded as 1), it predicts `Democrat` (encoded as 0).

The example usage demonstrates how the function works with a set of features. The list `nodes` stores the true or false values for the decision points in the tree, matching the structure and requirements of the problem.
