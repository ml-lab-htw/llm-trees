Certainly! Below is a Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features and target values provided. This function will return a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes of the tree.

Given the encoded features and target variable:
- `1` = Republican
- `0` = Democrat

Features (all feature votes can be `2` for yes or `1` for no):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize an array with None placeholders for the inner nodes
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for the inner nodes based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # check if voted "no" (i.e., 1)
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # check if voted "no" (i.e., 1) if nodes[0] is True
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1  # check if voted "no" (i.e., 1) if nodes[0] is False
    
    # Build the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X_sample = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function checks the specified conditions for `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`, `physician-fee-freeze`, and `el-salvador-adi` and uses these logical checks to traverse the decision tree to ultimately return a prediction along with the states of the nodes.

In the provided example `X_sample`, you can change the values to test different inputs and see how the function behaves and what predictions it makes.
