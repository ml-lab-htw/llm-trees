Here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the given features and target variable. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys must match the exact feature names.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

    # Node 0: Vote on aid to El Salvador (el-salvador-adi) <= 1.5
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5

    # Node 1: Vote on physician fee freeze (physician-fee-freeze) <= 1.5
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If el-salvador-adi <= 1.5
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If el-salvador-adi > 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If physician-fee-freeze > 1.5
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Inputs**:
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"el-salvador-adi"`, `"physician-fee-freeze"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes` is a list that stores the truth values (`True` or `False`) of the inner nodes of the decision tree.
   - `nodes[0]` checks whether the vote on aid to El Salvador (`el-salvador-adi`) is less than or equal to 1.5 (interpreted as "no").
   - `nodes[1]` checks whether the vote on the physician fee freeze (`physician-fee-freeze`) is less than or equal to 1.5 (interpreted as "no").

3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - The first split is based on `el-salvador-adi`. If the value is `<= 1.5`, the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
   - If `el-salvador-adi > 1.5`, the second split is based on `physician-fee-freeze`. If the value is `<= 1.5`, the prediction is `0` (Democrat); otherwise, the prediction is `1` (Republican).

4. **Outputs**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
``` 

This function is flexible and can be used for any input dictionary that matches the specified feature names.
