Here is the Python function to implement the decision tree for predicting party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the most important feature, `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict party affiliation (Republican = 1, Democrat = 0) using a decision tree of depth 1.
    
    Args:
        X: A dictionary of feature values for a single observation. The keys must exactly match the feature names.
        
    Returns:
        prediction: The predicted class (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes: A list where each entry represents the truth value of an inner node's condition (1 if true, 0 otherwise).
    """
    # Initialize the truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = [None]

    # Check the condition of the root node
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1  # "no" (1) -> likely Republican, "yes" (2) -> likely Democrat

    # Make a prediction based on the condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Key Feature**:
   - The feature `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution` was selected as the most important feature in a depth-1 decision tree.
   - This feature maps to votes on the adoption of the budget resolution, where:
     - `2 = yes`
     - `1 = no`
   - The logic is that a "no" (`<= 1`) vote aligns more closely with Republicans, and a "yes" (`> 1`) vote aligns more closely with Democrats.

2. **Nodes**:
   - The function calculates the truth value of the condition at the root node (`X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1`) and stores it in a list called `nodes`. A `1` in this list indicates the condition was satisfied, while a `0` means it was not.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the condition (`adoption-of-the-budget-resolution <= 1`) is `True`, the function predicts `1` (Republican).
   - Otherwise, it predicts `0` (Democrat).

4. **Input**:
   - The input `X` must be a dictionary, where the keys match the explicitly defined feature names and the values are their corresponding feature values for a single observation.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction (party affiliation):", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Truth values of inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output for the Example:
```plaintext
Prediction (party affiliation): Republican
Truth values of inner nodes: [1]
```

This indicates that the observation is classified as Republican because the condition `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution <= 1` was satisfied (`True`, represented by `1` in the `nodes` list).
