Here is the Python function based on the decision tree we previously discussed for classifying party affiliation using the provided features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1  # 1 means 'no', 2 means 'yes'

    if nodes[0]:  # el-salvador-adi == 1 (no)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # el-salvador-adi == 2 (yes)
        # Second decision node: Vote on physician fee freeze
        nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # 1 means 'no', 2 means 'yes'

        if nodes[1]:  # physician-fee-freeze == 1 (no)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # physician-fee-freeze == 2 (yes)
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
- **Input**: A dictionary `X` where the keys are feature names (as provided) and the values are the encoded votes (1 = no, 2 = yes).
- **Nodes**: The `nodes` list contains the truth values for the inner nodes. Each node represents a condition in the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Whether the vote on *aid to El Salvador* is 'no' (1).
  - `nodes[1]`: Whether the vote on *physician fee freeze* is 'no' (1), but only checked if the vote on *aid to El Salvador* is 'yes' (2).
- **Prediction**: The function returns `0` for Democrat and `1` for Republican based on the decisions.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input dictionary with votes
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,  # Yes on aid to El Salvador
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Node evaluations: {nodes}")
```

This function correctly implements the decision tree logic, returning both the predicted class and the evaluations of the inner nodes.
