Here is the Python function based on the decision tree classifier for predicting party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) using the provided features and mappings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Internal node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # Republican: Yes, Democrat: No
    nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2       # Republican: Yes, Democrat: No
    nodes[2] = X["mx-missile"] == 2            # Republican: Yes, Democrat: No
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # Republican: Yes, Democrat: No
    nodes[4] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 2  # Democrat: Yes, Republican: No

    # Decision logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze is "No" (Democrat tendency)
        if not nodes[1]:  # el-salvador-adi is "No" (Democrat tendency)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # el-salvador-adi is "Yes" (Republican tendency)
            if not nodes[2]:  # mx-missile is "No" (Democrat tendency)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # mx-missile is "Yes" (Republican tendency)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "Yes" (Republican tendency)
        if not nodes[3]:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is "No" (Democrat tendency)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is "Yes" (Republican tendency)
            if not nodes[4]:  # anti-satellite-test-ban is "No" (Republican tendency)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # anti-satellite-test-ban is "Yes" (Democrat tendency)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: Checks if the vote on the **physician-fee-freeze** was "Yes" (2). This is a key differentiator: Republicans typically vote "Yes" to freeze fees, while Democrats vote "No."
- **nodes[1]**: Checks if the vote on **el-salvador-adi** was "Yes" (2). Republicans generally supported aid to El Salvador during the Cold War era, while Democrats opposed it.
- **nodes[2]**: Checks if the vote on the **mx-missile** was "Yes" (2). Republicans favored defense spending, including missile systems, while Democrats were more likely to oppose.
- **nodes[3]**: Checks if the vote on the **adoption-of-the-budget-resolution** was "Yes" (2). Republicans are more likely to support budget resolutions that reflect fiscal conservatism.
- **nodes[4]**: Checks if the vote on the **anti-satellite-test-ban** was "Yes" (2). Democrats generally supported arms control measures like this one, while Republicans were more inclined to oppose.

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function will predict the party affiliation based on the values of the votes and indicate which internal conditions were satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false).
