Given your instructions and the specific feature keys, here is the Python function that implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to classify a politician's party affiliation based on vote preferences:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if physician-fee-freeze is yes
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # if physician-fee-freeze is no
        if nodes[1]:  # if adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is yes
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # if adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is no
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X_example = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Decision Path:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:

1. **`nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2`:** This node checks if the vote on the physician fee freeze is 'yes'. If true, the node is set to `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

2. **`nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2`:** This node checks if the vote on the budget resolution adoption is 'yes'. If true, the node is set to `1`; otherwise, it is `0`.

3. **Decision Making:**
    - If `nodes[0]` is true (meaning "physician fee freeze" is 'yes'), the prediction is Republican (`1`).
    - If `nodes[0]` is false (meaning "physician fee freeze" is 'no'):
        - Check `nodes[1]`, if true (meaning "adoption of the budget resolution" is 'yes'), then classify as Democrat (`0`).
        - If `nodes[1]` is also false (meaning "adoption of the budget resolution" is 'no'), then classify as Republican (`1`).

This function will output a prediction (`0` for Democrat or `1` for Republican) and a list of boolean outcomes for the inner nodes in the decision path.
