Below is the Python function for the decision tree to classify party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat). The function uses the structure of your decision tree and provides a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner node conditions as specified.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List representing inner nodes truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # "no" vote on budget resolution
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # "no" vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1  # "no" vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[3] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # "yes" vote on education spending

    # Prediction logic based on conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Budget resolution = "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # Physician fee freeze = "no"
            if nodes[2]:  # Aid to El Salvador = "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Aid to El Salvador = "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Physician fee freeze = "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Budget resolution = "yes"
        if nodes[3]:  # Education spending = "yes"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Education spending = "no"
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **How the Function Works**
- **Input**:
  The function takes an input dictionary `X` where the keys are the features (e.g., `"handicapped-infants"`, `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"`, etc.) and the values correspond to their encoded values (e.g., `2 = yes`, `1 = no`).

- **Output**:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (`0` = Democrat, `1` = Republican).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` = condition satisfied, `0` = condition not satisfied), corresponding to the inner decision nodes of the tree.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can use the function:

```python
# Example input features
example_features = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2,
}

# Get the prediction and truth value list for inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

# Output results
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

---

### **Example Output**
Using the `example_features` above, the output might look like:

```
Prediction: Democrat
Nodes: [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

The `Nodes` list indicates:
1. Node 0's condition is satisfied (`adoption-of-the-budget-resolution` = "no").
2. Node 1's condition is satisfied (`physician-fee-freeze` = "no").
3. Node 2's condition is satisfied (`el-salvador-adi` = "no").
4. Node 3's condition is satisfied (`education-spending` = "yes").

---

### **Tree Explanation**
The conditions in the function match the provided decision tree:
1. **Node 0** checks the "adoption of the budget resolution" vote.
2. **Node 1** checks the "physician fee freeze" vote.
3. **Node 2** checks the "aid to El Salvador" vote.
4. **Node 3** checks the "education spending" vote.

The thresholds used (`1 = no`, `2 = yes`) are directly tied to the feature encoding. This implementation ensures consistency with the dataset and target encoding.
