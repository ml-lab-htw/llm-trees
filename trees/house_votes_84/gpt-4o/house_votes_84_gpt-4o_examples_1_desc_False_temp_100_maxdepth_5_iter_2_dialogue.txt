Here is the decision tree function for classifying party affiliation (Republican = 1, Democrat = 0):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 5

    # Node 0: Check "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1  # Republican likely to vote 'no' (1)

    if nodes[0]:  # "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" == no
        # Node 1: Check "physician-fee-freeze"
        nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # Republican likely to vote 'no' (1)

        if nodes[1]:  # "physician-fee-freeze" == no
            # Node 2: Check "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"
            nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # Republican likely to vote 'no' (1)

            if nodes[2]:  # "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution" == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution" == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # "physician-fee-freeze" == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras" == yes
        # Node 3: Check "crime"
        nodes[3] = X["crime"] == 1  # Republican likely to vote 'no' (1)

        if nodes[3]:  # "crime" == no
            # Node 4: Check "synfuels-corporation-cutback"
            nodes[4] = X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 1  # Republican likely to vote 'no' (1)

            if nodes[4]:  # "synfuels-corporation-cutback" == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # "synfuels-corporation-cutback" == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # "crime" == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input:**  
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to a feature (e.g., `'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'`, `'physician-fee-freeze'`) and each value is the feature's value (either `1` or `2`).

2. **Nodes:**  
   - A list `nodes` is used to store whether the condition for each decision tree node is satisfied (`True` or `False`).

3. **Logic:**  
   - Each node corresponds to a condition based on feature thresholds (e.g., a vote being either `1` or `2`). The tree splits based on these conditions, and the prediction branches accordingly.

4. **Output:**  
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: The final classification (`0` = Democrat, `1` = Republican).
     - `nodes`: A list of `True`/`False` values indicating whether the condition of each node was satisfied.

### Testing the Function:

Here is how you can test the function with a sample input:

```python
# Example input
sample_input = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

# Predict the party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Inner nodes evaluation:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
Given the above input, the output might look like this (hypothetical, since no actual data has been provided):

```
Prediction: Democrat
Inner nodes evaluation: [True, True, True, False, True]
```

This means:
- `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` condition is satisfied (`True`).
- `physician-fee-freeze` condition is satisfied (`True`).
- `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution` condition is satisfied (`True`).
- `crime` condition is not satisfied (`False`).
- `synfuels-corporation-cutback` condition is satisfied (`True`). 

This format adheres to the requirements you provided, with truth values for inner nodes and a final classification.
