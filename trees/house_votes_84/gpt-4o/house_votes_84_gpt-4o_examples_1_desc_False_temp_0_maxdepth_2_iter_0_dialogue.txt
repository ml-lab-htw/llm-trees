Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the given features and target variable. The function predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If vote on aid to El Salvador is "no"
        # Node 1: Check the vote on physician fee freeze
        nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If vote on physician fee freeze is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If vote on physician fee freeze is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If vote on aid to El Salvador is "yes"
        # Node 1: Check the vote on MX missile
        nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] <= 1  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If vote on MX missile is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If vote on MX missile is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"el-salvador-adi"`, `"physician-fee-freeze"`, `"mx-missile"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition at the root node (`"el-salvador-adi" <= 1`).
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition at the second level, which depends on the path taken.
3. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks whether the vote on aid to El Salvador (`"el-salvador-adi"`) is "no" (1).
   - If the first condition is satisfied, the second condition checks the vote on physician fee freeze (`"physician-fee-freeze"`).
   - If the first condition is not satisfied, the second condition checks the vote on MX missile (`"mx-missile"`).
4. **Prediction**: Based on the conditions, the function predicts the party affiliation:
   - `0` for Democrat.
   - `1` for Republican.
5. **Output**: The function returns a tuple:
   - The first element is the prediction (`0` or `1`).
   - The second element is the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

This function is designed to work with the exact feature names and encodings provided in the prompt. Make sure the input dictionary matches the expected format.
