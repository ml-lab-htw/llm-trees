Based on the features and target value encoding you've provided, we will create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to predict party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat). We'll use the most important features from our earlier example:

1. Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
2. Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras

Here's how the function `predict` will look like:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'yes'
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage

Let's try to predict some examples:

```python
# Example 1: 
# A voter who voted yes on adoption of the budget resolution and no on aid to Nicaraguan contras
example_1 = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2, 
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

pred, nodes = predict(example_1)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if pred == 1 else 'Democrat'}, Nodes: {nodes}")

# Example 2:
# A voter who voted no on adoption of the budget resolution and yes on aid to Nicaraguan contras
example_2 = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1, 
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

pred, nodes = predict(example_2)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if pred == 1 else 'Democrat'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function takes an input dictionary `X` with the specified features, evaluates the decision tree conditions, and returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
