Here is the Python function for your described decision tree classifier. This implementation is based on selecting the feature **'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras'** as the splitting feature, assuming it is the most important feature for classification at depth 1.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) based on voting features.
    
    Arguments:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the 16 features of a voting record.

    Returns:
    int: 0 if Democrat, 1 if Republican
    list: List of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Array to store the truth value of the inner node (only 1 node for depth 1).
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # Condition for the first (and only) node.

    if nodes[0]:  # If 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' is NO (1 = no)
        prediction = 0  # Classify as Democrat
    else:  # If 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras' is YES (2 = yes)
        prediction = 1  # Classify as Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage

Suppose you provide a dictionary `X` with values for each of the 16 features:

```python
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,  # Voted "No" (<= 1)
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican
print("Inner Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

Output:
```
Prediction: 0
Inner Node Truth Values: [True]
```

### Explanation:

1. `nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1`
   - This evaluates whether the vote on "aid to Nicaraguan contras" was **No** (`1`). If it was **No**, the condition is satisfied (`True`), predicting a **Democrat (0)**.
   - If the vote was **Yes** (`2`), the condition is not satisfied (`False`), predicting a **Republican (1)**.

2. The returned list `nodes` provides a record of the truth value of the conditions in the tree's inner nodes. Since this tree has only one node, the list contains one element (`True` or `False`).

This function classifies voting records with a depth-1 decision tree and tracks the evaluation of the node conditions in the `nodes` list.
