Hereâ€™s how you can implement the decision tree as a Python function for your given feature set and target variable (party affiliation):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the voting record features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features.
                  The feature keys must match the exact keys described earlier.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted class (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list of int): A list of truth values (1 if the node's condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) 
                             for each decision node in the tree.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: First split based on "el-salvador-adi" (vote on aid to El Salvador)
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1  # "no" votes split left (condition true), "yes" votes split right (condition false)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Second split for "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution" (vote on adoption of the budget resolution) if Node 0 is true
        nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1  # "no" votes split left, "yes" votes split right
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 2: Second split for "synfuels-corporation-cutback" (vote on synfuels corporation cutback) if Node 0 is false
        nodes[2] = X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] <= 1  # "no" votes split left, "yes" votes split right
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Inputs:**
   - The function expects a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding votes (e.g., `2 = yes`, `1 = no`).

2. **Decision Tree Structure:**
   - The first split is based on `el-salvador-adi` (aid to El Salvador):
     - If the vote is "no" (encoded as `<= 1`), the second split uses the feature `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`.
     - If the vote is "yes" (encoded as `> 1`), the next split uses the feature `synfuels-corporation-cutback`.

3. **Conditions:**
   - For each split, a condition checks if the input feature value satisfies some threshold (e.g., `<= 1` for "no").
   - The boolean results of these conditions are stored in the `nodes` list:
     - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first split.
     - `nodes[1]` and `nodes[2]` correspond to the second-level splits.

4. **Outputs:**
   - The `prediction` is the predicted party affiliation (`1 = Republican`, `0 = Democrat`).
   - The `nodes` list provides a trace of the truth values of the conditions at each decision node in the tree.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example data point
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1,
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat):", prediction)
print("Nodes (truth values of the tree conditions):", nodes)
```

### Example Output:

For the provided example feature dictionary (`X_example`):

```plaintext
Prediction (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat): 0
Nodes (truth values of the tree conditions): [0, None, 1]
```

This output means:
- The first condition (`nodes[0]`) was false (the feature `el-salvador-adi > 1`).
- The second split, represented by `nodes[2]`, was true (`synfuels-corporation-cutback <= 1`).
- Based on this, the decision tree predicts the party affiliation as `Democrat (0)`.
