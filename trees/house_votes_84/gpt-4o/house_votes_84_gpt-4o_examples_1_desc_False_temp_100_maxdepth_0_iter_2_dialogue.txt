### Explanation:

- **Node 1 (`physician-fee-freeze`)**: This is the first split because the vote on the physician fee freeze is a strong indicator of party affiliation. Republicans are more likely to vote "no" (1), while Democrats are more likely to vote "yes" (2).
  
- **Node 2 (`el-salvador-adi`)**: If they voted "no" on the physician fee freeze (leaning Republican), the vote on aid to El Salvador is used to further refine the prediction. Republicans are more likely to support this aid ("yes" = 2).
  
- **Node 3 (`anti-satellite-test-ban`)**: If they voted "no" on aid to El Salvador, the vote on the anti-satellite test ban is checked. Democrats are more likely to support a test ban ("yes" = 2).
  
- **Node 4 (`education-spending`)**: If they voted "yes" on the physician fee freeze (leaning Democrat), the vote on education spending is used to further refine the prediction. Democrats are more likely to support this ("yes" = 2).
  
- **Node 5 (`synfuels-corporation-cutback`)**: If they voted "no" on education spending, the vote on synfuels corporation cutback is used. Democrats are more likely to support cutting back on synfuels ("yes" = 2).

By following this structure, the decision tree makes a prediction based on the sequence of votes, and the `nodes` list records which conditions were satisfied along the way.
