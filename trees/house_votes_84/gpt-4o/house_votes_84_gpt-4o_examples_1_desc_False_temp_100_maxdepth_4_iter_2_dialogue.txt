Here's how your decision tree can be implemented as a Python function. The function will return both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the feature values in X.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary where the keys are feature names and the values are feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """

    # Truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 1  # physician-fee-freeze: (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[1] = X['el-salvador-adi'] == 1       # el-salvador-adi: (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[2] = X['mx-missile'] == 1            # mx-missile: (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[3] = X['duty-free-exports'] == 1     # duty-free-exports: (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    
    # Traverse the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze == no
        if nodes[1]:  # el-salvador-adi == no
            if nodes[2]:  # mx-missile == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # mx-missile == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # el-salvador-adi == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze == yes
        if nodes[3]:  # duty-free-exports == no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # duty-free-exports == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes Array**:
   - The `nodes` array keeps track of whether each condition in the inner nodes of the decision tree is satisfied or not.
   - Each `node[i]` is `1` (True) if the condition is satisfied, and `0` (False) otherwise.

2. **Conditions**:
   - Each node evaluates one of the feature-based conditions:
     - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `'physician-fee-freeze'` is "no" (1).
     - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `'el-salvador-adi'` is "no" (1).
     - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `'mx-missile'` is "no" (1).
     - `nodes[3]`: Checks if `'duty-free-exports'` is "no" (1).

3. **Tree Traversal**:
   - The decision tree is structured as nested `if` statements, mirroring the decision rules in the initial tree.

   - For example:
     - If `'physician-fee-freeze'` is "no" and `'el-salvador-adi'` is "no" and `'mx-missile'` is "no", the prediction is `0` (Democrat).

4. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - **Prediction**: `0` (Democrat) or `1` (Republican).
     - **Nodes**: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Input features
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # no
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,       # no
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,            # no
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,     # no
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Inner Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
If the input features are as defined above, the output will be:

```
Prediction: Democrat
Inner Node Truth Values: [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This reflects the truth values for the conditions at each internal decision node as well as the final classification.
