Here is the Python function implementing your decision tree classifier based on the prompt. The tree will classify the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat), return a prediction, and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree classifier to predict party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat)
    based on voting records (features).
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing input features.

    Returns:
    tuple:
        - prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize the list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define decision tree logic based on the features
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2  # Root node: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2       # Next: Vote on aid to El Salvador
    nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2    # Next: Vote on education spending
    nodes[3] = X["crime"] == 2                 # Next: Vote on crime
    nodes[4] = X["superfund-right-to-sue"] == 1  # Next: Vote on superfund right to sue

    # Decision tree traversal to assign prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # If "physician-fee-freeze" == 2 (Yes)
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If "physician-fee-freeze" == 1 (No)
        if nodes[1]:  # If "el-salvador-adi" == 2 (Yes)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If "el-salvador-adi" == 1 (No)
            if nodes[2]:  # If "education-spending" == 2 (Yes)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # If "education-spending" == 1 (No)
                if nodes[3]:  # If "crime" == 2 (Yes)
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:  # If "crime" == 1 (No)
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Example input dictionary of features
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,  # Yes
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,  # No
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 1,  # No
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,  # No
    "crime": 2,  # Yes
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

# Get the prediction and truth values of decision tree nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Print results
print("Prediction (party affiliation):", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Inner node truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
Prediction (party affiliation): Republican
Inner node truth values: [True, False, False, True, False]
```

### Explanation of the Function

1. **Nodes List:**  
   - The `nodes` list keeps track of whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`).
   - Each index in the `nodes` list corresponds to an inner node in the decision tree.

2. **Decision Tree Structure:**  
   - The decision-making process follows the structure described in the original question (depth = 5). Each condition checks the value of a specific feature.

3. **Readable Logic:**  
   - The function explicitly translates conditions like `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2` to determine the paths in the tree.

4. **Prediction Output:**  
   - The function returns two outputs:
     - A single prediction value representing party affiliation (`1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat).
     - A list of truth values for the internal nodes describing the traversal path in the tree.

Feel free to adjust the thresholds or decision logic if you have additional insights or data.
