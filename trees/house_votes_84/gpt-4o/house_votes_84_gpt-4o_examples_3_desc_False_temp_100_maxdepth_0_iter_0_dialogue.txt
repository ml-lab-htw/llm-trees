Based on the example structure you provided, I will create a Python function that takes a dictionary of features and returns a prediction along with a list of inner node truth values. Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["mx-missile"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["duty-free-exports"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Node Values:", nodes)
```

This function evaluates the votes in the given order and tracks which nodes (conditions) are met. The `nodes` list contains 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise. The prediction is made based on the traversed path through the decision tree, resulting in either "Republican" or "Democrat".

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Initialize a list of `None` values, one for each decision node in our tree.
2. **Conditions**: Each condition is evaluated and stored in the `nodes` list.
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the vote on the physician fee freeze is 'no' (`1`).
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the vote on the anti-satellite test ban is 'no' (`1`).
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the vote on the MX missile is 'no' (`1`).
    - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the vote on duty-free exports is 'no' (`1`).
3. **Decision-making**:
    - The function traverses the tree according to the conditions, making a prediction based on the votes. 
    - If the physician fee freeze is voted 'no' and the anti-satellite test ban is also voted 'no', the prediction is Democrat.
    - If the physician fee freeze is voted 'no' and the anti-satellite test ban is voted 'yes', the prediction is Republican.
    - If the physician fee freeze is voted 'yes' and the MX missile is voted 'no', the prediction is Democrat.
    - If the physician fee freeze is voted 'yes' and the MX missile is voted 'yes', it further checks the vote on duty-free exports.
4. **Output**: Return the prediction (0 for Democrat or 1 for Republican) and the list of node truth values.
