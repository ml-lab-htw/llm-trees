Certainly! Based on the given features and our decision tree, I'll write a Python function that decides on the party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on the votes for the issue of handicapped infants and the MX missile. The function will also include a list that records the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = X['handicapped-infants'] <= 1
    nodes[1] = X['mx-missile'] <= 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Handicapped infants vote is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # MX missile vote is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Handicapped infants vote is "yes"
        if nodes[1]:  # MX missile vote is "no"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# features = {'handicapped-infants': 1, 'mx-missile': 2}
# prediction, nodes = predict(features)
# print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
- `nodes[0]` checks if the vote on the issue of handicapped infants is "no" (encoded as 1).
- `nodes[1]` checks if the vote on the MX missile is also "no" (encoded as 1).
- Based on the values of these nodes, the function makes a prediction about the party affiliation, where 0 represents Democrat and 1 represents Republican.

You can use this function by providing a dictionary with the keys matching the exact spelling of the features and values as specified (2 for yes, 1 for no).

To test the function, you can create a dictionary with the feature values and call the `predict` function with it. The function will return the prediction along with the state of the decision nodes.
