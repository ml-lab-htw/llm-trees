Hereâ€™s the requested function in Python, implementing a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1 using the feature `el-salvador-adi` (Vote on aid to El Salvador):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree-based prediction for party affiliation (Democrat or Republican).
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): Input features including 'el-salvador-adi', where:
                  el-salvador-adi: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no).
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): Predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
        nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes as 1 (satisfied) or 0 (not satisfied).
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Check the condition for the root node
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # 2 represents 'yes'
    
    # Make prediction based on the condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Features**: The feature used in this single-depth decision tree is `el-salvador-adi`.
   - The feature checks whether a representative voted "yes" (`2`) or "no" (`1`) on aid to El Salvador.
   
2. **Nodes**: A list is created to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
   - The decision checks whether `el-salvador-adi` is equal to `2` (indicating a "yes" vote).
   - If the condition is satisfied (`el-salvador-adi == 2`), the node is evaluated as `1` (true); otherwise, it is `0` (false).

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the condition is satisfied (the representative voted "yes" on aid to El Salvador), the prediction is `1` (Republican).
   - If the condition is not satisfied (the representative voted "no"), the prediction is `0` (Democrat).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Input feature dictionary
X = {"el-salvador-adi": 2}  # Representative voted "yes" on aid to El Salvador
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")

X = {"el-salvador-adi": 1}  # Representative voted "no" on aid to El Salvador
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Output:
For the first input:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [1]
```

For the second input:
```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0]
```

Let me know if you'd like to extend this tree for deeper levels or incorporate additional features!
