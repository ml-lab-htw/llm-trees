Certainly! Hereâ€™s a Python function for the decision tree based on the given features and target variable. The function evaluates the features in the provided order and returns a prediction along with a list of truth values representing the nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Evaluating the conditions for the nodes
    nodes[0] = X["handicapped-infants"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["mx-missile"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    nodes[4] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 2

    # Making a prediction based on the nodes' conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Vote on the issue of handicapped infants: yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Vote on MX missile: yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Vote on MX missile: no
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras: no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Vote on the issue of handicapped infants: no
        if nodes[3]:  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution: yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution: no
            if nodes[4]:  # Vote on physician fee freeze: yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Vote on physician fee freeze: no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,  # yes
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,  # no
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,  # yes
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,  # no
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,  # no
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,  # no
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,  # no
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,  # no
    'mx-missile': 1,  # no
    'immigration': 1,  # no
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,  # no
    'education-spending': 1,  # no
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,  # no
    'crime': 1,  # no
    'duty-free-exports': 1,  # no
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1  # no
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes Array**: The `nodes` array holds boolean values corresponding to the conditions for each split in the decision tree. Each element in this array represents whether a particular condition (node) in the tree is satisfied (`True` or `False`).
2. **Decision Tree Logic**: The `if` statements replicate the decision tree structure, evaluating the conditions in the specified order and determining the class (`Republican` or `Democrat`) based on those evaluations.
3. **Example Usage**: The `example_features` dictionary demonstrates how to use the `predict` function with a sample set of feature values, and prints out the prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

This function can be extended or modified further as needed based on additional data or more complex decision trees.
