Here's how the decision tree classifier function for classifying party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) could look like following the given instructions and formatting:

### Python Function

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts party affiliation (Republican=1 or Democrat=0) based on voting records.
    
    Input:
        X: dict
          A dictionary containing the following keys:
          - 'handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing', 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution',
            'physician-fee-freeze', 'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools', 'anti-satellite-test-ban',
            'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 'mx-missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels-corporation-cutback',
            'education-spending', 'superfund-right-to-sue', 'crime', 'duty-free-exports', 
            'export-administration-act-south-africa'
          Each key will contain a value (1 = no, 2 = yes).
          
    Returns:
        prediction: int
            1 for Republican, 0 for Democrat
        nodes: list[int]
            A list of truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) for each node in the decision tree.
    """
    
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # To track truth values for internal nodes

    # Node 0: Split based on adoption-of-the-budget-resolution
    nodes[0] = X['adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == 1 (No)
        # Node 1: Split based on physician-fee-freeze
        nodes[1] = X['physician-fee-freeze'] == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # physician-fee-freeze == 1 (No)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # physician-fee-freeze == 2 (Yes)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == 2 (Yes)
        # Node 2: Split based on el-salvador-adi
        nodes[2] = X['el-salvador-adi'] == 1
        if nodes[2]:  # el-salvador-adi == 1 (No)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # el-salvador-adi == 2 (Yes)
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Tree:

1. **Root Node (Node 0):** The first decision is based on `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`. If "No" (1), move to Node 1. If "Yes" (2), move to Node 2.

2. **Node 1 (Child of Node 0):** For those who voted "No" on `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`, the next feature checked is `'physician-fee-freeze'`. 
   - If "No" (1), predict Republican (1).
   - If "Yes" (2), predict Democrat (0).

3. **Node 2 (Child of Node 0):** For those who voted "Yes" on `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution'`, the next feature checked is `'el-salvador-adi'`. 
   - If "No" (1), predict Democrat (0).
   - If "Yes" (2), predict Republican (1).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (Party Affiliation):", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Truth Values for Nodes:", nodes)
```

---

### Example Output:

For the provided `X`:

1. `'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution' == 1` → Node 0 = `True`
2. `'physician-fee-freeze' == 1` → Node 1 = `True`
   
Prediction = 1 (Republican)

```
Prediction (Party Affiliation): Republican
Truth Values for Nodes: [1, 1, None]
```
