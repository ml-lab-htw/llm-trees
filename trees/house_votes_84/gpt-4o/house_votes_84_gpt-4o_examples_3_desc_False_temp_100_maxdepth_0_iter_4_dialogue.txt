Given the decision tree structure and the feature names as provided, below is a Python function that uses a decision tree to predict the party affiliation (Democrat = 0, Republican = 1). The function will return both the prediction and a list of truth values corresponding to the inner nodes.

Here is the implementation based on a simplified logic inferred from the provided information:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the nodes list with None values. The number of nodes depends on the decision tree depth.
    nodes = [None, None, None]

    # Define the conditions for each node in the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X['mx-missile'] == 1  # first split
    nodes[1] = X['export-administration-act-south-africa'] == 1  # second split if first condition is true
    nodes[2] = X['handicapped-infants'] == 1  # third split if second condition is true
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # mx-missile = No (True because in encoding No = 1)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        if not nodes[1]:  # export-administration-act-south-africa = No (True because in encoding No = 1)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            if not nodes[2]:  # handicapped-infants = No (True because in encoding No = 1)
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    # Return the prediction and the nodes
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The `nodes` list will store boolean values representing the truth of each node's condition in the decision tree.
2. **Conditions for Nodes**: Given the importance and splitting order of the attributes provided in previous examples (hypothetical logic):
   - The first condition checks the `mx-missile` vote.
   - The second condition checks the `export-administration-act-south-africa` vote, but only if the first condition is true.
   - The third condition checks the `handicapped-infants` vote, but only if the second condition is true.
3. **Decision Tree Logic**: Based on the conditions set in the `nodes` list:
   - If the `Vote on MX missile` is "No" (represented as `1` in encoding), it directly classifies it as Democrat (`0`).
   - If the `Vote on MX missile` is "Yes" (not equal to `1`), then it further checks the `export-administration-act-south-africa` vote.
   - Depending on the `export-administration-act-south-africa` vote being "No" or "Yes", it finally checks the `handicapped-infants` vote to determine the class as either Republican or Democrat.

The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with a set of voting features to get the prediction and the intermediate nodes' truth values.
