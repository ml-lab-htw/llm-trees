Sure, I can format a decision tree classifier based on the provided details, using a Python function. The function will return a single prediction (party affiliation) as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Here is how the function would look:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["handicapped-infants"] == 1  # Vote on the issue of handicapped infants == no
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # Vote on adoption of the budget resolution == no
    nodes[2] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # Vote on physician fee freeze == no

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
sample_features = {
    'handicapped-infants': 1,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 2,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 2,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Decision Path:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Condition Definitions**:
    - `nodes[0] = X["handicapped-infants"] == 1`: Checks if the vote on the issue of handicapped infants is 'no'.
    - `nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1`: Checks if the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is 'no'.
    - `nodes[2] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1`: Checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no'.

2. **Decision Path**:
    - The first condition checked is on the vote for handicapped infants.
    - If the vote is 'no', we move to the vote on the adoption of the budget resolution.
    - For a 'yes' vote on the issue of handicapped infants, we consider the vote on the physician fee freeze.

3. **Prediction**:
    - Based on the conditions above, the function determines whether to classify as Democrat or Republican.

4. **Return Values**:
    - The function returns the prediction and the list of boolean values indicating whether each decision node condition was satisfied.

This simple decision tree uses criteria to predict party affiliation, adhering to the given constraints and feature spellings. Adjustments can be made for more complex conditions or additional nodes as needed.
