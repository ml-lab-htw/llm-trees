Here is the Python function based on the given input data and the described decision tree. This will classify the party affiliation (Democrat or Republican) and return the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of nodes (truth values of inner nodes)
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Compute truth values for each decision node
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # Corresponds to 'no' (Democrat: no, Republican: yes)
    nodes[1] = X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 1  # Corresponds to 'no' (Democrat: no, Republican: yes)
    nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2  # Corresponds to 'yes' (Democrat: yes, Republican: no)
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Physician fee freeze 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # Synfuels corporation cutback 'no'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Synfuels corporation cutback 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Physician fee freeze 'yes'
        if nodes[2]:  # Adoption of the budget resolution 'yes'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Adoption of the budget resolution 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Function:

1. **Input:**
   - `X`: A dictionary where each key is the name of a feature, and the value is the corresponding vote encoding.
     - e.g., `X = {"physician-fee-freeze": 1, "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2, "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1}`.

2. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to evaluating the feature `"physician-fee-freeze"`.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to evaluating the feature `"synfuels-corporation-cutback"`.
   - `nodes[2]` corresponds to evaluating the feature `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"`.

3. **Logic:**
   - The logic follows the decision tree from the earlier explanation. Each condition checks the vote value to determine the path in the tree.
     - `"physician-fee-freeze == 1"` checks if the vote is `"no"`, which points to Democrat initially.
     - `"synfuels-corporation-cutback == 1"` checks if the vote is `"no"`, continuing to Democrat.
     - `"adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == 2"` checks if the vote is `"yes"`, continuing to Democrat.

4. **Output:**
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation. `(0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican)`
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values `[node_0, node_1, node_2]`, representing whether the condition at each inner node was satisfied or not.

### Example Usage:

1. **Input Example 1:**
   ```python
   X = {
       "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
       "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
       "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2
   }
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Democrat)
   print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True]
   ```

2. **Input Example 2:**
   ```python
   X = {
       "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
       "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
       "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1
   }
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Republican)
   print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [False, False, False]
   ```

This function can now handle classification tasks based on the provided decision tree.
