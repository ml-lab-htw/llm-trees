    # Node 0: aid-to-nicaraguan-contras (2 = yes, 1 = no)

            prediction = 0  # Democrat

### Explanation of the Python Function:
- **Node 0** checks how the person voted on **aid to Nicaraguan Contras**. If they voted **"no"** (`1`), the code proceeds to evaluate the next feature.
- **Node 1** checks how they voted on the **physician fee freeze**. If they also voted **"no"** (`1`), the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`). If they voted **"yes"** (`2`), the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
- If the person voted **"yes"** (`2`) on **aid to Nicaraguan Contras** (meaning they supported it), the function evaluates **Node 2**, which checks how they voted on the **MX missile**.
  - If they voted **"no"** on the **MX missile** (`1`), the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).
  - If they voted **"yes"** on the **MX missile** (`2`), the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
  
The function returns:
- A **prediction** (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).
- A list of truth values (`nodes`) representing whether each condition was satisfied during the decision process.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,  # no
    "mx-missile": 2,  # yes
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Output:
```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True, True, None]
```

This indicates that the person voted **"no"** on aid to Nicaraguan Contras and **"no"** on physician fee freeze, leading to a **Democrat** prediction.
