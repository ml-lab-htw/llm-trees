Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier that predicts party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the given features and thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) based on the input features.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate the first decision node
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1  # Democrat votes "no" (1), Republican votes "yes" (2)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # el-salvador-adi == 1 (Democrat)
        prediction = 0
    else:  # el-salvador-adi == 2 (Republican)
        # Evaluate the second decision node
        nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] == 2  # Republican votes "yes" (2), Democrat votes "no" (1)
        
        if nodes[1]:  # mx-missile == 2 (Republican)
            prediction = 1
        else:  # mx-missile == 1 (Democrat)
            prediction = 0
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision node checks the value of the `"el-salvador-adi"` feature:
   - If `el-salvador-adi == 1` (voted "no"), the prediction is **Democrat (0)**.
   - If `el-salvador-adi == 2` (voted "yes"), proceed to the next decision node.

2. **Node 1**: The second decision node checks the value of the `"mx-missile"` feature:
   - If `mx-missile == 2` (voted "yes"), the prediction is **Republican (1)**.
   - If `mx-missile == 1` (voted "no"), the prediction is **Democrat (0)**.

3. **Truth Values**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]` is `1` if `el-salvador-adi == 1` (condition satisfied), otherwise `0`.
   - `nodes[1]` is `1` if `mx-missile == 2` (condition satisfied), otherwise `0`.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example feature input
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 2,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1,
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Republican)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [0, 1]
```

### Notes:
- The feature values must match the encoding provided in the prompt (e.g., `1` for "no" and `2` for "yes").
- The function uses only two features (`el-salvador-adi` and `mx-missile`) for classification, as specified by the decision tree's maximum depth of 2.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process.
