Here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier that uses the provided features and encoding to predict the party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat). The function returns a prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list for inner node truth values
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Physician fee freeze vote
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # Check if physician fee freeze vote is 'no' (1 = no)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Aid to El Salvador vote
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2  # Check if aid to El Salvador vote is 'yes' (2 = yes)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Republican if 'no' to physician fee freeze and 'yes' to aid to El Salvador
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:
            # Democrat if 'no' to physician fee freeze and 'no' to aid to El Salvador
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 2: Education spending vote
        nodes[2] = X["education-spending"] == 2  # Check if education spending vote is 'yes' (2 = yes)
        
        if nodes[2]:
            # Democrat if 'yes' to physician fee freeze and 'yes' to education spending
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            # Republican if 'yes' to physician fee freeze and 'no' to education spending
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks whether the "physician-fee-freeze" vote is "no" (mapped to 1). If this condition is true, we move down one branch; otherwise, we check the next condition.
   
2. **Node 1**: For those who voted "no" on the physician fee freeze, the next check is whether they voted "yes" (mapped to 2) for aid to El Salvador. If they did, the prediction is Republican, otherwise Democrat.

3. **Node 2**: For those who voted "yes" on the physician fee freeze, the next check is whether they supported education spending ("yes" = 2). If they did, the prediction is Democrat; otherwise, it's Republican.

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}
```

### Example Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print(nodes)       # Output: [False, None, True]
```

In this case:
- The first node (`nodes[0]`) evaluates to `False` because the "physician-fee-freeze" vote is `2` (yes).
- Since the first condition was false, the decision tree moves to check the education spending vote (`nodes[2]`), which evaluates to `True`, resulting in a prediction of `0` (Democrat).
