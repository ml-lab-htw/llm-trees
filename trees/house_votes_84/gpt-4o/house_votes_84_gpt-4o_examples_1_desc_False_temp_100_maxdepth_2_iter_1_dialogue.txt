Here's the Python function implementing a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, based on the given feature names and target encoding. This function will return the predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat) and a list of truth values representing whether the conditions at each inner node are satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5  # Democrat if "no" (1), Republican if "yes" (2)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the vote on aid to El Salvador is "no" (<= 1.5)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If the vote on aid to El Salvador is "yes" (> 1.5)
        # Second decision node: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5  # Democrat if "no" (1), Republican if "yes" (2)
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "no" (<= 1.5)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "yes" (> 1.5)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **First node**: We check the vote on **aid to El Salvador** (`el-salvador-adi`):
   - If the vote is "no" (`1`), the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).
   - If the vote is "yes" (`2`), we move to the next node.
   
2. **Second node**: We then check the vote on **adoption of the budget resolution** (`adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`):
   - If the vote is "no" (`1`), the prediction is **Democrat** (`0`).
   - If the vote is "yes" (`2`), the prediction is **Republican** (`1`).
   
### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2,
    "target": 0
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will return the predicted party affiliation and the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
