Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting party affiliation (Republican or Democrat). The function takes a dictionary (`X`) of features and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values corresponding to the inner nodes of the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # A list to store truth values for 4 inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze (2 = yes, 1 = no)
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # "no" vote

    if nodes[0]:  # Node 0 is satisfied: "no" to physician fee freeze
        # Node 1: Vote on aid to El Salvador (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1  # "no" vote

        if nodes[1]:  # Node 1 is satisfied: "no" to aid to El Salvador
            # Node 2: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (2 = yes, 1 = no)
            nodes[2] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # "no" vote

            if nodes[2]:  # Node 2 is satisfied: "no" to budget resolution
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Node 2 is not satisfied: "yes" to budget resolution
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Node 1 is not satisfied: "yes" to aid to El Salvador
            # Node 3: Vote on MX missile (2 = yes, 1 = no)
            nodes[3] = X["mx-missile"] == 1  # "no" vote

            if nodes[3]:  # Node 3 is satisfied: "no" to MX missile
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Node 3 is not satisfied: "yes" to MX missile
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # Node 0 is not satisfied: "yes" to physician fee freeze
        # Node 1: Vote on crime (2 = yes, 1 = no)
        nodes[1] = X["crime"] == 1  # "no" vote

        if nodes[1]:  # Node 1 is satisfied: "no" to crime
            # Node 2: Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (2 = yes, 1 = no)
            nodes[2] = X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 1  # "no" vote

            if nodes[2]:  # Node 2 is satisfied: "no" to synfuels corporation cutback
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # Node 2 is not satisfied: "yes" to synfuels corporation cutback
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Node 1 is not satisfied: "yes" to crime
            # Node 3: Vote on education spending (2 = yes, 1 = no)
            nodes[3] = X["education-spending"] == 1  # "no" vote

            if nodes[3]:  # Node 3 is satisfied: "no" to education spending
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Node 3 is not satisfied: "yes" to education spending
                prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input format**: `X` is a dictionary where the keys are exactly as provided in the feature set:
   ```
   ['handicapped-infants', 'water-project-cost-sharing', 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution',
    'physician-fee-freeze', 'el-salvador-adi', 'religious-groups-in-schools', 'anti-satellite-test-ban',
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras', 'mx-missile', 'immigration', 'synfuels-corporation-cutback',
    'education-spending', 'superfund-right-to-sue', 'crime', 'duty-free-exports',
    'export-administration-act-south-africa']
   ```
2. **Target values**:
   - `1`: Republican
   - `0`: Democrat

3. **Decision-making process**:
   - The first condition checks the value of `physician-fee-freeze`.
   - Based on its value, subsequent decisions depend on votes for `el-salvador-adi`, `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution`, `mx-missile`, `crime`, `synfuels-corporation-cutback`, and `education-spending`.

4. **Truth values**:
   - The function keeps track of which nodes (conditions) are satisfied (`True` or `False`), returning this as a list along with the prediction.
   - For example, if `nodes[0] == True`, it means the condition `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1` (voted "no" to physician fee freeze) is satisfied.

### Example:
#### Input:
```python
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 1,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1,
}
```

#### Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True, True, None]
```

This represents:
- `nodes[0]`: `X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1` -> True
- `nodes[1]`: `X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1` -> True
- `nodes[2]`: `X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1` -> True
- `nodes[3]`: Not evaluated since the path terminates earlier.
