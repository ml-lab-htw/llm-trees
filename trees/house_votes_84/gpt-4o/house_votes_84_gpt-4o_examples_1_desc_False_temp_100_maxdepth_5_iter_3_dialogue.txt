Here is your decision tree as a Python function following the provided format. The function takes a dictionary of features (votes) as input, and returns the predicted party affiliation along with a list of truth values for the conditions in the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values for the conditions in the nodes
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Define the conditions in the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5  # Split on vote for aid to El Salvador
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] <= 1.5  # Split on budget resolution
    nodes[2] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # Split on physician fee freeze
    nodes[3] = X["crime"] <= 1.5  # Split on vote on crime
    nodes[4] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] <= 1.5  # Split on anti-satellite test ban

    # Traverse the decision tree using the conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # If "el-salvador-adi" <= 1.5 (no)
        if nodes[1]:  # If "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution" <= 1.5 (no)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution" > 1.5 (yes)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # "el-salvador-adi" > 1.5 (yes)
        if nodes[2]:  # If "physician-fee-freeze" <= 1.5 (no)
            if nodes[3]:  # If "crime" <= 1.5 (no)
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # "crime" > 1.5 (yes)
                if nodes[4]:  # If "anti-satellite-test-ban" <= 1.5 (no)
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
                else:  # "anti-satellite-test-ban" > 1.5 (yes)
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # "physician-fee-freeze" > 1.5 (yes)
            if X["mx-missile"] <= 1.5:  # Additional condition on "mx-missile"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Republican

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function
1. **Initialization of Nodes**:
   - The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at the inner nodes of the decision tree.

2. **Threshold Values**:
   - For binary features (`yes/no` votes), thresholds `<= 1.5` correspond to "no," and `> 1.5` corresponds to "yes" since the feature encoding uses `1 = no` and `2 = yes`.

3. **Tree Construction**:
   - The decision tree structure is implemented using nested `if...else` statements.
   - At each split, the feature's value from `X` (input dictionary) is compared against its threshold.

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction` is the predicted target value (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).
   - `nodes` is a list of Boolean values (`True` or `False`), indicating whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.

### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can use the function:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_test = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

# Get the prediction and truth values of nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)

# Print the results
print("Prediction (party affiliation):", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output
For the example `X_test`, the output might look like this:

```
Prediction (party affiliation): Democrat
Nodes truth values: [False, False, True, False, True]
```

This means:
- The prediction is `Democrat` (`0`).
- The conditions at the nodes were evaluated as follows:
  - `el-salvador-adi <= 1.5`: False
  - `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution <= 1.5`: False
  - `physician-fee-freeze <= 1.5`: True
  - `crime <= 1.5`: False
  - `anti-satellite-test-ban <= 1.5`: True
