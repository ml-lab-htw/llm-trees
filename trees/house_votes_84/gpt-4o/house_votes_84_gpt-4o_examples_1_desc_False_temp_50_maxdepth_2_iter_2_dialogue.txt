Hereâ€™s the requested Python function for the decision tree that predicts party affiliation (`0 = Democrat`, `1 = Republican`) based on the given features and thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted party affiliation (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican).
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the conditions at each inner node.
    """
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If "physician-fee-freeze" is no (<= 1.5)
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If "physician-fee-freeze" is yes (> 1.5)
        # Node 1: Vote on aid to El Salvador
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] <= 1.5  # 1 = no, 2 = yes
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If "el-salvador-adi" is no (<= 1.5)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If "el-salvador-adi" is yes (> 1.5)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**:
   - `X`: A dictionary where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"physician-fee-freeze"`, `"el-salvador-adi"`) and the values are the encoded feature values (e.g., `1 = no`, `2 = yes`).

2. **Inner Nodes**:
   - **Node 0**: Checks if the vote on `"physician-fee-freeze"` is "no" (`<= 1.5`). If true, predicts `0` (Democrat).
   - **Node 1**: If the vote on `"physician-fee-freeze"` is "yes" (`> 1.5`), checks if the vote on `"el-salvador-adi"` is "no" (`<= 1.5`). If true, predicts `0` (Democrat); otherwise, predicts `1` (Republican).

3. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted party affiliation (`0 = Democrat`, `1 = Republican`).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 1,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 1,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}

# Predict party affiliation
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Nodes:", nodes)           # Output: [1, None]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds (`<= 1.5`) are based on the encoding of `1 = no` and `2 = yes`. This ensures that the conditions are correctly interpreted.
- The function handles a maximum depth of 2, as required.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process.
