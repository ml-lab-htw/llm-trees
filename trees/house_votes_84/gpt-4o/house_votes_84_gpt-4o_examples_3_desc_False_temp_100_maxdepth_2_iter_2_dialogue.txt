Certainly! Below is the Python function that creates a Decision Tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. This classifier uses the provided features to predict the party affiliation based on the most important features according to the given information. 

Here are the conditions for the decision tree nodes based on the votes:

1. The first node checks the vote on the issue of handicapped infants (yes = 2, no = 1).
2. The second node checks the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes = 2, no = 1).

The function returns a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants
    nodes[0] = X["handicapped-infants"] <= 1  # 1 corresponds to 'no'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:
        # Node 1: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras
        nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] <= 1  # 1 corresponds to 'no'
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the vote on the issue of handicapped infants is 'no' (<= 1). If it is 'no', the prediction is Democrat (0).
2. If the condition in Node 0 is not met (i.e., the vote on the issue of handicapped infants is 'yes'), then the next condition is checked in:
3. **Node 1**: Checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is 'no' (<= 1). If it is 'no', the prediction is Democrat (0). Otherwise, the prediction is Republican (1).

This function examines the votes sequentially and returns the classification result based on the conditions specified along with the truth values of the conditions (nodes).
