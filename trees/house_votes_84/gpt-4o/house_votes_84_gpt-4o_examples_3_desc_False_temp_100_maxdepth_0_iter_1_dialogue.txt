Sure, let's construct a decision tree for classifying party affiliation based on the voting features. We'll format it as a Python function that returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Party Affiliation Decision Tree

Here's the Python function based on the decision tree described earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 2
    nodes[1] = X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 2
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 2
    nodes[3] = X["mx-missile"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # Vote on the budget resolution == yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Vote on synfuels corporation cutback == yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Vote on aid to El Salvador == yes
                prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # Vote on aid to El Salvador == no
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # Vote on synfuels corporation cutback == no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # Vote on the budget resolution == no
        if nodes[3]:  # Vote on adoption of the MX missile == yes
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # Vote on adoption of the MX missile == no
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1,
    'el-salvador-adi': 2,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 1,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 2,
    'education-spending': 1,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 1,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input:**
   - The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the values for each feature.
   
2. **Nodes:**
   - We initialize a list `nodes` of size 4 to store the truth values of the conditions corresponding to the nodes in the decision tree.
   
3. **Conditions:**
   - For each condition in the decision tree, we set the appropriate value in the `nodes` list:
     - `nodes[0]` checks if the vote on the adoption of the budget resolution is 'yes'.
     - `nodes[1]` checks if the vote on synfuels corporation cutback is 'yes'.
     - `nodes[2]` checks if the vote on aid to El Salvador is 'yes'.
     - `nodes[3]` checks if the vote on the MX missile is 'yes'.

4. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - We implement the decision tree logic using nested `if-else` statements to determine the prediction (Republican or Democrat). The logic follows the structure of the decision tree described earlier.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the prediction (as 1 for Republican or 0 for Democrat) and the list `nodes` indicating whether each condition was satisfied (1) or not (0).

### Example Usage:
In the example usage section, an example input dictionary `X` is provided with arbitrary values for each feature. The function is called, and it prints the prediction and the truth values of the nodes.
