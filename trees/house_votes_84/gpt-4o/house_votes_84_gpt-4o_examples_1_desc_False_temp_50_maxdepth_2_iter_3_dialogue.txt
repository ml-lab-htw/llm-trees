Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The function will return a prediction (0 for Democrat, 1 for Republican) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation based on the decision tree.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys should match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Vote on physician fee freeze
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # Condition: voted "no" (1)

    # Node 1: Vote on adoption of the budget resolution
    nodes[1] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # Condition: voted "no" (1)

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If voted "no" on physician fee freeze
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If voted "yes" on physician fee freeze
        if nodes[1]:  # If voted "no" on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # If voted "yes" on adoption of the budget resolution
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision node, which checks if the individual voted "no" (`1`) on the **physician fee freeze**.
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision node, which checks if the individual voted "no" (`1`) on the **adoption of the budget resolution**.

2. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If the individual voted "no" on the **physician fee freeze**, they are classified as a Democrat (`0`).
   - If the individual voted "yes" on the **physician fee freeze**, the decision depends on their vote on the **adoption of the budget resolution**:
     - If they voted "no" on the budget resolution, they are classified as a Republican (`1`).
     - If they voted "yes" on the budget resolution, they are classified as a Democrat (`0`).

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - The first element is the predicted class (`0` for Democrat, `1` for Republican).
     - The second element is a list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2,
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1,
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2,
    'el-salvador-adi': 1,
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 2,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 1,
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2,
    'mx-missile': 1,
    'immigration': 2,
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1,
    'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1,
    'crime': 2,
    'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 = Democrat, 1 = Republican
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values of the inner nodes
```

---

### Example Output:
For the given `X`:
```plaintext
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [False, True]
```

This means the individual is classified as a Democrat (`0`) and:
- The first condition (`physician-fee-freeze == 1`) is `False` (not satisfied).
- The second condition (`adoption-of-the-budget-resolution == 1`) is `True` (satisfied).
