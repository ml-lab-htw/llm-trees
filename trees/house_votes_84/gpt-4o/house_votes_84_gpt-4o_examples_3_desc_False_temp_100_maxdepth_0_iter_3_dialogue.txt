Sure! Let's format the decision tree for the given features and target variable into a Python function. We'll create a function that takes a dictionary of feature values as input and returns a prediction along with a list of truth values indicating the conditions checked in the decision tree.

Here's how the function might look:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Check the first condition
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Check the second condition if the first is true
        nodes[1] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Let's create an example input dictionary
example_input = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2, 
    'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, 
    'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 2, 
    'physician-fee-freeze': 1, 
    'el-salvador-adi': 2, 
    'religious-groups-in-schools': 1, 
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2, 
    'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 2, 
    'mx-missile': 1, 
    'immigration': 2, 
    'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1, 
    'education-spending': 2, 
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 1, 
    'crime': 2, 
    'duty-free-exports': 2, 
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 1
}

# Predict the class and the nodes' truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

In this decision tree:
- The first condition (`nodes[0]`) checks if the vote on physician fee freeze is 'no' (`1`).
- If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `True`), we proceed to check the next condition (`nodes[1]`), which is whether the vote on aid to El Salvador is 'no' (`1`).
- Based on these checks, the prediction is made for party affiliation.

You can extend this function by adding more conditions if you have more complex trees. For now, this function reflects the simple example you asked for.
