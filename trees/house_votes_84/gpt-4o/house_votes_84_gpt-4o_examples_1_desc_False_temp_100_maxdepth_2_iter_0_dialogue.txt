Here's the Python function based on the decision tree we discussed earlier, formatted as per your specifications. It will take in a dictionary `X` representing the feature values, return the predicted party affiliation (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat), and also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision: Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1

    # Second decision: Vote on handicapped infants (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[1] = X["handicapped-infants"] == 1 if nodes[0] else None

    if nodes[0]:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras == 1 (no)
        if nodes[1]:  # handicapped-infants == 1 (no)
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # handicapped-infants == 2 (yes)
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras == 2 (yes)
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **First node** (`nodes[0]`): Decides based on the vote on **aid to Nicaraguan contras**. If the vote is "no" (1), it sets `nodes[0] = True`. If the vote is "yes" (2), it sets `nodes[0] = False`.
   
2. **Second node** (`nodes[1]`): This node is only evaluated if the first node is `True` (meaning the `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` vote was "no"). It checks the vote on **handicapped infants**. If the vote is "no" (1), it sets `nodes[1] = True`. If the vote is "yes" (2), it sets `nodes[1] = False`.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the person voted **no** on both `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras` and `handicapped-infants`, the prediction is **Democrat (0)**.
   - If the person voted **yes** on `handicapped-infants` but **no** on `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras`, the prediction is **Republican (1)**.
   - If the person voted **yes** on `aid-to-nicaraguan-contras`, the prediction is **Republican (1)**, regardless of the other vote.

### Example Usage:

```python
X_sample = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

- In this case, the prediction would be **Democrat (0)**, since both votes are "no" (1). The `nodes` list would be `[True, True]`.
