Based on the example and instructions provided, I will create a Python function that implements a depth-1 decision tree classifier for predicting the "party affiliation" based on the feature "physician-fee-freeze."

Here’s the formatted Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict the party affiliation (Republican or Democrat) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values with the exact keys as described.

    Returns:
    prediction (int): The predicted value for the target variable (1 = Republican, 0 = Democrat).
    nodes (list): A list of 1s and 0s indicating which inner nodes were satisfied.
    """
    # Initialize nodes array, one entry corresponding to the single decision node
    nodes = 1 * [None]

    # Decision rule for the first (and only) node: "physician-fee-freeze <= 1"
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1

    # Make the prediction based on the node's condition
    if nodes[0]:  # If true, "physician-fee-freeze <= 1" is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Democrat
    else:  # If false, "physician-fee-freeze > 1"
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `X` is a dictionary containing inputs for all the features with exact keys as provided. For example:
     ```python
     X = {
         "handicapped-infants": 2,
         "water-project-cost-sharing": 2,
         "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
         "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
         # Other features...
     }
     ```

2. **Inner Node Condition**:
   - The decision tree evaluates a single node based on `X["physician-fee-freeze"]`:
     - If `X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1`, the prediction is `0` (Democrat).
     - Otherwise, the prediction is `1` (Republican).

3. **Outputs**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted value of the target (`party affiliation`).
   - `nodes`: A list containing a `1` or `0` for each inner node of the tree, where:
     - `1` means the condition of the node was satisfied.
     - `0` means it wasn’t.

### Example Usage:
Here’s how you can use the function to make predictions:

```python
# Example input dictionary
example_input = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,  # Example feature being split on
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 2,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 1,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 1,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 2,
    "education-spending": 1,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 2,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 1,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2,
}

# Predict using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Democrat)
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: [True] or [1]
```

### Output:
For the given input, assuming `physician-fee-freeze = 1`:
- Prediction: `0` (Democrat)
- Node Truth Values: `[True]` or `[1]` (Condition satisfied: `physician-fee-freeze <= 1`).
