To build the decision tree classifier and format it as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, we need to follow the structure you've provided. Here is the final implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # We have two nodes in this decision tree
    
    # Define inner nodes based on the given conditions
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # (yes votes encoded as 2, no votes encoded as 1)
    nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1  # (yes votes encoded as 2, no votes encoded as 1)
    
    # Decision tree logic to make predictions
    if nodes[0]:  # If the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "no"
            prediction = 0  # Democrat
        else:  # If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # If the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "yes"
        prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
# X is a dictionary where key is the feature name and value is the corresponding value
X_example = {
    'handicapped-infants': 2, 'water-project-cost-sharing': 1, 'adoption-of-the-budget-resolution': 1,
    'physician-fee-freeze': 2, 'el-salvador-adi': 2, 'religious-groups-in-schools': 1,
    'anti-satellite-test-ban': 2, 'aid-to-nicaraguan-contras': 1, 'mx-missile': 2,
    'immigration': 2, 'synfuels-corporation-cutback': 1, 'education-spending': 2,
    'superfund-right-to-sue': 2, 'crime': 2, 'duty-free-exports': 1,
    'export-administration-act-south-africa': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Republican' if prediction == 1 else 'Democrat'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**:
  - `nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1`: This checks if the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "no."
  - `nodes[1] = X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1`: This checks if the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "no."

- **Decision Logic**:
  - If the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "no" (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the tree then checks the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras.
    - If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is also "no" (`nodes[1]` is `True`), the classifier predicts `Democrat` (0).
    - If the vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras is "yes" (`nodes[1]` is `False`), the classifier predicts `Republican` (1).
  - If the vote on adoption of the budget resolution is "yes" (`nodes[0]` is `False`), the classifier directly predicts `Republican` (1).

The example usage shows how to use the function with sample data to obtain the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
