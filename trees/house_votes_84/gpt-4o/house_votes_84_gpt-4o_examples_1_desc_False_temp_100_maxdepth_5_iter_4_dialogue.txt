Here is the Python function that implements the requested decision tree with the format you provided. The function uses the features you listed and includes intermediate truth values (`nodes`) for every inner node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values for inner nodes.

    # Evaluate the decision tree nodes
    nodes[0] = X["adoption-of-the-budget-resolution"] == 1  # "no" vote
    nodes[1] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] == 1  # "no" vote
    nodes[2] = X["el-salvador-adi"] == 1  # "no" vote
    nodes[3] = X["water-project-cost-sharing"] == 1  # "no" vote
    nodes[4] = X["mx-missile"] == 1  # "no" vote

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is "no"
        if nodes[1]:  # If physician-fee-freeze is "no"
            if nodes[2]:  # If el-salvador-adi is "no"
                if nodes[3]:  # If water-project-cost-sharing is "no"
                    prediction = 0  # Democrat
                else:  # water-project-cost-sharing is "yes"
                    prediction = 1  # Republican
            else:  # el-salvador-adi is "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # physician-fee-freeze is "yes"
            if nodes[4]:  # If mx-missile is "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # mx-missile is "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # adoption-of-the-budget-resolution is "yes"
        if X["synfuels-corporation-cutback"] == 1:  # If synfuels-corporation-cutback is "no"
            if X["aid-to-nicaraguan-contras"] == 1:  # If aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "no"
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # aid-to-nicaraguan-contras is "yes"
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # synfuels-corporation-cutback is "yes"
            prediction = 1  # Republican

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Encoding**:
   - The function assumes the provided dataset encoding: `2 = yes`, `1 = no`.
   - Every condition checks for specific feature values according to the decision tree.

2. **Tree Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the root-level condition: `adoption-of-the-budget-resolution` being "no".
   - `nodes[1]` to `nodes[4]` correspond to deeper conditions in the tree.
   - The `nodes` list contains `1` (True) if the condition is met, otherwise `0` (False).

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: `1` for Republican, `0` for Democrat.
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` or `0`) for each inner node in the tree.

### Example Usage:
Input:
```python
X = {
    "handicapped-infants": 1,
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 1,
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,
    "mx-missile": 2,
    "immigration": 2,
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,
    "education-spending": 2,
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,
    "crime": 2,
    "duty-free-exports": 2,
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 1
}
```

Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 1 (Republican)
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Node Truth Values: [True, True, False, False, False]
```
