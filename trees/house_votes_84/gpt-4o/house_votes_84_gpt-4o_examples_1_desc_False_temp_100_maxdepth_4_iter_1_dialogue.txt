Below is the Python function that implements the requested decision tree classifier. It predicts the party affiliation (`1 = Republican`, `0 = Democrat`) while also returning a list of truth values corresponding to the inner nodes of the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Decision rules for the tree
    nodes[0] = X["physician-fee-freeze"] <= 1.5  # 'yes' (2) -> False, 'no' (1) -> True
    nodes[1] = X["mx-missile"] <= 1.5  # 'yes' (2) -> False, 'no' (1) -> True
    nodes[2] = X["duty-free-exports"] <= 1.5  # 'yes' (2) -> False, 'no' (1) -> True
    nodes[3] = X["anti-satellite-test-ban"] <= 1.5  # 'yes' (2) -> False, 'no' (1) -> True

    # Prediction logic based on decision rules
    if nodes[0]:  # physician-fee-freeze = 'no'
        if nodes[1]:  # mx-missile = 'no'
            if nodes[2]:  # duty-free-exports = 'no'
                prediction = 0  # Democrat
            else:  # duty-free-exports = 'yes'
                prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # mx-missile = 'yes'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
    else:  # physician-fee-freeze = 'yes'
        if nodes[3]:  # anti-satellite-test-ban = 'no'
            prediction = 1  # Republican
        else:  # anti-satellite-test-ban = 'yes'
            prediction = 0  # Democrat

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Explanation:

1. **Inner Nodes**:
   - **nodes[0]**: Checks if `physician-fee-freeze` is `no` (encoded as `1`), which helps branch the decision tree at the top level.
   - **nodes[1]**: Checks if `mx-missile` is `no` (encoded as `1`), affecting the classification under this branch.
   - **nodes[2]**: Checks if `duty-free-exports` is `no` (encoded as `1`), further refining the classification.
   - **nodes[3]**: Checks if `anti-satellite-test-ban` is `no` (encoded as `1`).

2. **Thresholds**:
   - For binary yes/no features, thresholds are set at `1.5` to differentiate between `1` (no) and `2` (yes).

3. **Leaf Nodes (Predictions)**:
   - The `if-else` conditions lead to one of the two predictions:
     - `1`: Republican
     - `0`: Democrat

### Example Usage:

Here is an example dataset to test the decision tree:

```python
# Example input
sample_data = {
    "handicapped-infants": 2,  # yes
    "water-project-cost-sharing": 1,  # no
    "adoption-of-the-budget-resolution": 2,  # yes
    "physician-fee-freeze": 1,  # no
    "el-salvador-adi": 2,  # yes
    "religious-groups-in-schools": 1,  # no
    "anti-satellite-test-ban": 2,  # yes
    "aid-to-nicaraguan-contras": 2,  # yes
    "mx-missile": 1,  # no
    "immigration": 2,  # yes
    "synfuels-corporation-cutback": 1,  # no
    "education-spending": 2,  # yes
    "superfund-right-to-sue": 1,  # no
    "crime": 2,  # yes
    "duty-free-exports": 1,  # no
    "export-administration-act-south-africa": 2,  # yes
}

# Get prediction and truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_data)

print("Prediction:", "Republican" if prediction == 1 else "Democrat")
print("Truth values for inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:

```
Prediction: Democrat
Truth values for inner nodes: [True, True, True, False]
```

This indicates:
- The decision tree was satisfied at node 0 (`physician-fee-freeze = no`).
- It branched left when evaluating `mx-missile = no`, `duty-free-exports = no`.
- The truth value at `anti-satellite-test-ban = yes` failed the condition.
