```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Using baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 45 # Using superficial T2 values

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage change
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage change
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Abnormal cartilage change

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Thresholds:**

For this example, I've chosen `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) and `ccMF.S.T2.Me` (superficial T2 values) as the splitting features.  These features seem likely to be related to cartilage health and potential changes over time.

The thresholds (2.5 for `ccmfthctabame` and 45 for  `ccMF.S.T2.Me`) are chosen arbitrarily.   Since we're not training the tree on actual data, I have no basis for selecting optimal thresholds.  In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be determined during the tree-building process using a dataset.


**Important Notes:**

* **No Training:**  The provided code creates a decision tree structure *without any training*.  The feature choices and thresholds are illustrative and not based on data analysis.  The resulting tree will therefore likely have poor predictive accuracy on real-world data.
* **Depth Limitation:** The tree is designed to have a maximum depth of 2, satisfying the requirement of 2 to 3 inner nodes.
* **Feature Importance:**  The prompt mentions "most important features."  Without training data, we can't determine feature importance. The features selected are a best guess based on their descriptions.
* **Python Function Format:** The code adheres to the requested format, returning the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.


To make this a truly useful decision tree, you'll need to train it using a labeled dataset and a decision tree learning algorithm (like those found in scikit-learn).  The training process will automatically determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure to maximize predictive performance.
