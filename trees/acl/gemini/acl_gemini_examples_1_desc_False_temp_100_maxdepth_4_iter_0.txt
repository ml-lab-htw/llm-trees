**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Feature Importance:**  The code assumes BMI, Age, Lysholm, IKDC, and Tegner are the most important features.  **You MUST replace this with your actual feature importance determination.**  How you get feature importance without training data is context-dependent. You might have domain knowledge, prior research, or other methods to guide you.

2. **Node Conditions:** The conditions in the `if/else` statements (e.g., `X["BMI_FP"] > 25`) are examples. You'll need to carefully define these thresholds based on your understanding of the features and how they might relate to cartilage thickness change.

3. **Depth and Nodes:** The example ensures the tree has a maximum depth of 4.  The number of nodes can vary (between 4 and 15 in your request), and you can adjust the conditions and the structure to achieve the desired number.

4. **No Training:** The crucial point is that this code *generates* a decision tree structure without training on data. It's a rule-based approach where you, the expert, define the rules.

5. **Python Function Format:** The code adheres to the required format, taking a dictionary `X` of features as input and returning the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values (0 or 1) for the inner node conditions.
