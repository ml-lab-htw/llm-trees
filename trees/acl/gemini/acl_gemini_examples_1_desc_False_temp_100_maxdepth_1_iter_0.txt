```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.95  # Example threshold - no training data used

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Example prediction - no training data used
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Example prediction - no training data used
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of the generated code:**

1. **Threshold Selection:**  The decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 needs a single splitting criterion. Since no training data is provided, I've arbitrarily chosen  `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) as the feature for the split and 1.95 as the threshold.  In a real-world scenario, this threshold would be determined by a decision tree algorithm based on maximizing information gain or minimizing Gini impurity on the training data.

2. **Prediction:**  Similarly, the predictions (0 or 1) in the `if` and `else` blocks are also examples.  A trained decision tree would assign the most frequent class in the respective leaf nodes.

3. **`nodes` List:**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean result of the splitting condition.  This allows us to trace the path taken through the decision tree for a given input.


**How this would work with real training data:**

A decision tree algorithm, like those in scikit-learn, would:

* **Evaluate all possible splits:** It would consider every feature and different thresholds for each feature to find the best split. The "best" split is the one that most effectively separates the data based on the target variable (`x1` in this case).  Metrics like Gini impurity or information gain are used to quantify how good a split is.
* **Build the tree recursively:**  If the maximum depth was greater than 1, the algorithm would recursively repeat the splitting process on the subsets of data created by the first split. This would continue until the maximum depth is reached or further splitting doesn't improve the model's performance significantly.
* **Assign predictions to leaf nodes:**  Once the tree structure is determined, each leaf node (the end points of the tree) is assigned a prediction.  This prediction is typically the majority class of the training examples that end up in that leaf.


Because you've specified no training data, the code provides a template of a depth-1 decision tree, but the threshold and predictions are placeholders.  To make a useful decision tree, you would need to provide training data and use a decision tree learning algorithm.
