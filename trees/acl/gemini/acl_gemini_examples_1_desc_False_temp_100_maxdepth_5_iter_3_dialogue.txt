**Explanation of Thresholds and Logic:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 1.8`:**  A lower baseline cartilage thickness might indicate a higher risk of abnormal change.
* **`Lysholm <= 70`:** A lower Lysholm score suggests poorer knee function and a higher likelihood of abnormal change.
* **`Tegner <= 3`:** A lower Tegner activity score might indicate limitations due to the injury, increasing the risk of abnormal change.
* **`ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 45`:** A lower T2 value in the deep cartilage layers is generally considered healthier.
* **`Age <= 30`:** Younger individuals are often assumed to have better healing capacity.
* **`Group` checks:**  The `Group` feature (coper, noncoper, surgical reconstruction) is used as a strong indicator, especially when combined with other factors.


**Important Reminders:**

* **Hypothetical Tree:** This tree structure and the chosen thresholds are *examples* based on general domain knowledge.  They are *not* derived from any actual data analysis.
* **Real-world Application:**  In a real application, you *must* train a decision tree model on a dataset to determine the optimal tree structure and thresholds.  This code only provides a template for the function format.


This improved version adheres to the requested format, provides more context for the decision logic, and uses the specified feature names.  However, the critical point remains:  its accuracy and usefulness depend entirely on being trained with real data.
