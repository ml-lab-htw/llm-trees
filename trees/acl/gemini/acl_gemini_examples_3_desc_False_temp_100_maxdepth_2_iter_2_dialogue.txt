Let's assume, for the purpose of this example, that `ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness) and `Lysholm` score are the two most important features for predicting cartilage thickness change after ACL injury.  We'll use reasonable threshold values, but remember these would be determined by training a model on real data.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 1: Check baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Hypothetical threshold: 0.8 mm

    # Node 2: Check Lysholm score (only if baseline thickness > 0.8)
    nodes[1] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70  # Hypothetical threshold: 70

    if nodes[0]:  # Baseline thickness <= 0.8 mm
        prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:  # Baseline thickness > 0.8 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # Lysholm score <= 70
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:  # Lysholm score > 70
            prediction = 0  # Normal

    return prediction, nodes



```


**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Feature Importance:**  The choice of `ccmfthctabame` and `Lysholm` is an assumption.  In a real application, you *must* perform feature importance analysis on your dataset to determine the most relevant features.
* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds 0.8 mm for cartilage thickness and 70 for the Lysholm score are *examples*.  You need to determine the optimal thresholds using your data. This is done during the training process of the decision tree algorithm.
* **Depth 2 Enforcement:** The code directly implements the depth-2 logic using nested `if` statements. The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Remember that you might need to preprocess your data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables) before using it to train a decision tree model and before using this `predict` function.


**How to use the function:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'Group': 2, 'Sex': 0, 'Height': 165, 'Body_Mass_FP': 60, 'BMI_FP': 22.04, 'Age': 25, 
    'Lysholm': 85, 'IKDC': 90, 'Tegner': 5, 'ccmfthctabame': 0.9, 
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 45, 'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 30, 'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 120, 
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -80, 'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 50, 
    'Dominant_Leg': 1, 'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```


This will output the predicted cartilage change (0 or 1) and the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember to replace the example data and thresholds with your actual data and trained model parameters.
