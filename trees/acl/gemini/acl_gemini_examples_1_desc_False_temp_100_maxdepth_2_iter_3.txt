```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.0  # Example threshold - adjust as needed
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30  # Example threshold - adjust as needed

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification:**

This code implements a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, using the provided Features and target variable 'x1'.  Since we are asked to generate the tree *without training*, the thresholds and feature selections are exemplary and not optimized for actual predictive performance.  In a real-world scenario, you would train the decision tree on data to learn these parameters.


* **Feature Selection (Heuristic):**  I've selected `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) and `Age` as the features for the decision tree's inner nodes.  These are chosen heuristically based on domain knowledge. Cartilage thickness seems directly relevant to cartilage *change* (the target), and age is often a factor in tissue healing and regeneration.  In a real application, feature importance would be determined through training a model on data.
* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (2.0 for cartilage thickness and 30 for age) are also examples.  These would be learned during the training process if you were using a decision tree learning algorithm.
* **Depth and Structure:** The `if/else` structure implements the binary splits of the decision tree based on the feature values and thresholds.  It adheres to the maximum depth of 2, resulting in a tree with two inner nodes and three leaf nodes (representing the predictions 0 or 1).
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the predicted class (0 or 1 for 'x1') and the list `nodes`, which records the truth values of the conditions at each inner node (1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise). This list allows for inspecting the path taken through the tree for a given input.



**To use this function:**

```python
example_input = {
    "Group": 0,
    "Sex": 1,
    # ... (all other features)
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.5, 
    "Age": 25,
    # ... (remaining features)
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 30,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```


**Important Note:**  Because this tree is not trained, it's unlikely to be a good predictor of cartilage thickness change. The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate the structure and implementation of a basic decision tree based on the given specifications and constraints.  To build an effective classifier, you would need to use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) with labeled training data.
