def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Thresholds based on hypothetical average change and group differences.  These
    # would need to be determined from actual data analysis in a real application.
    thickness_threshold = -0.2  # Hypothetical threshold for cartilage thickness change (mm)

    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= thickness_threshold  # Check if cartilage loss exceeds threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 0  # Check if the patient is a coper (Group 0)


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal if cartilage loss is below threshold
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Normal if above threshold, but a coper
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Abnormal if above threshold and non-coper or surgical


    return prediction, nodes



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  I've added a placeholder `thickness_threshold = -0.2`. This assumes a decrease in cartilage thickness of more than 0.2mm is potentially abnormal. This value is entirely hypothetical and should be replaced with a data-driven threshold.
2. **Group Handling:** The `Group` feature is used in the second level as per our hypothetical tree.  We assume copers might exhibit normal cartilage even with a decrease beyond the initial threshold.
3. **Data-Driven Approach (Crucial):**  The thresholds and even the choice of features are based on assumptions.  To make this function truly useful, you *must* train a decision tree classifier on a real dataset with labeled outcomes (normal/abnormal cartilage change).  Libraries like scikit-learn in Python can do this automatically, determining the best splitting features and thresholds.
4. **Missing Values:** The current function doesn't handle missing values.  You might need to add logic to impute missing data or handle cases where crucial features are absent.
5. **Error Handling:** Consider adding checks for invalid input types or unexpected feature values.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'Group': 1,  # Non-coper
    'Sex': 0,
    'Height': 170,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 65,
    'BMI_FP': 22.5,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 80,
    'IKDC': 75,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': -0.3,  # Cartilage thickness change beyond threshold
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 45,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 30,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 120,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -80,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 50,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Abnormal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False] (Both conditions are false)
```
