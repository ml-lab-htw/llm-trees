**Explanation and Reasoning for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

The decision tree logic is constructed without training on actual data, as requested. The feature selection and threshold values are therefore chosen based on general domain knowledge about potential relationships between the features and cartilage thickness change (x1). These are meant to be illustrative examples, and a real-world application would require training on actual data.

* **BMI_FP:**  Higher BMI could be associated with abnormal cartilage changes due to increased stress on the joints. A threshold of 25 (the upper limit of normal BMI) is used.
* **Age:** Older age might be linked to slower healing and potentially more abnormal cartilage changes.  A threshold of 30 is used, representing a younger vs. older adult division.
* **ccmfthctabame (Baseline Cartilage Thickness):**  A thinner baseline cartilage thickness might suggest a higher risk of abnormal change. A threshold of 2.0 mm (example value) is used.
* **Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ (Knee Moment):**  Forces acting on the knee during injury could influence cartilage changes.  A threshold of -50 Nm (example value) is used.
* **Lysholm (Lysholm Score):**  This score assesses knee function. Lower scores might correlate with abnormal cartilage changes.  A threshold of 80 (example value) is used.



**Important Notes:**

* This decision tree is *not* trained and is based on hypothetical relationships. The performance on real data would need to be evaluated and the tree structure likely adjusted.
* The threshold values are chosen for illustrative purposes only.  In a real application, these values should be determined through data analysis and model training.
* Feature importance is simulated by arbitrarily selecting features that seem relevant based on general domain knowledge. A true assessment of feature importance requires training on real data.


This generated function fulfills the prompt's requirements by creating a decision tree of depth 5, using selected features, defining arbitrary thresholds, and returning both the prediction and the node truth values.  The provided examples were only for formatting - the prompt explicitly asked *not* to train a tree based on existing data.  Remember to train the model with your dataset to get meaningful results for your specific problem.
