```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.5  # Threshold for cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # Check if the group is surgical reconstruction

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal if cartilage thickness is below threshold
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal if cartilage thickness is above threshold and group is surgical reconstruction
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal if cartilage thickness is above threshold and group is not surgical reconstruction (but further investigation might be needed)


    return prediction, nodes

```


This function reflects the hypothetical decision tree structure discussed previously.  Remember, this is a simplified example and should not be used in a real-world medical setting without proper training and validation on relevant data. The threshold of 1.5mm for `ccmfthctabame` is an educated guess, and the actual value should be determined through clinical studies and data analysis.  Similarly, the assumption that surgical reconstruction leads to normal cartilage thickness needs to be validated with data.
