        else:  # Non-coper or surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else: # ccmfthctabame > 1.8
        if nodes[1]: # Lysholm <= 70

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 1.8`:** This threshold is based on the idea that a lower baseline cartilage thickness might indicate a higher risk of abnormal changes. 1.8mm is a somewhat arbitrary value chosen for demonstration; a real threshold would be learned from the data.  Thicker cartilage at baseline might suggest better joint health.
* **`Lysholm <= 70`:**  The Lysholm score assesses knee function.  A lower score generally indicates worse function.  A threshold of 70 is commonly used as a cutoff point for good/poor function.  We hypothesize that individuals with lower Lysholm scores (worse function) might be more likely to experience abnormal cartilage changes.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Thresholds:** As emphasized before, these thresholds are chosen for demonstration purposes.  Without actual data, it's impossible to determine optimal thresholds.  In a real-world scenario, these values would be determined by the decision tree learning algorithm during training.
* **Feature Importance:** The choice of `ccmfthctabame`, `Group`, and `Lysholm` as the splitting features is based on assumed domain knowledge.  A true decision tree algorithm would select the best features based on the data.
* **Data Required:**  This function provides a framework, but its effectiveness depends entirely on the training data used to determine appropriate thresholds and feature splits.  Testing and validation on real data are crucial.


This improved version directly uses the provided feature names and encodings and includes more realistic (though still hypothetical) threshold values.  Remember, for accurate predictions, you'll need to train a decision tree model on your dataset using a machine learning library.
