Key changes and explanations:

1. **Node Initialization:**  The `nodes` list is initialized to 15 `None` values to accommodate the maximum number of inner nodes.
2. **Feature Selection and Thresholds:**  The features and thresholds used in the conditions are arbitrary as you specified no training. I've tried to select a variety of features to demonstrate the structure.  In a real application, these would be determined by a training process.
3. **Nested `if/else` Structure:** The code is structured with nested `if/else` statements to represent the branches of the decision tree. This reflects how a decision tree makes a prediction by following a path based on the feature values.
4. **Return Used Nodes:** The function returns `nodes[:15]` to ensure that only the nodes used in the tree (up to 15) are returned. This is important because the depth might vary.
5. **Arbitrary Depth:** The example you provided had depth 4, but the prompt also mentioned between 4 and 15 inner nodes.
