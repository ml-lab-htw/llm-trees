**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (1.8 mm for cartilage thickness) are placeholders.  You *must* determine appropriate thresholds based on analysis of your labeled data and consultation with medical experts. What constitutes "normal" cartilage thickness change is a clinical question.
* **Feature Selection:**  This example uses `ccmfthctabame` and `Group`.  This is a simplification.  In reality, you should carefully evaluate feature importance using statistical methods or machine learning techniques once you have labeled data. You might find other features are more predictive.
* **Depth Limitation:** The function adheres to the maximum depth of 2.
* **Medical Validity:**  This is a demonstration. The chosen features and thresholds are hypothetical.  Do *not* use this function for actual medical decision-making without proper validation with real-world data and expert input.
* **Error Handling:** This simplified version doesn't include error handling (e.g., missing data).  In a production setting, you would add checks to handle potential issues with the input data.


**How to improve this function:**

1. **Data Collection and Labeling:**  Acquire a dataset of patients with ACL injuries, including the features listed and a clear determination of whether the cartilage thickness change at 12 months is normal or abnormal (based on medical criteria).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  Analyze the distributions of your features and their relationship with the outcome (cartilage change).  This will help you identify potentially important features and guide threshold selection.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Consider creating Features (e.g., the change in cartilage thickness over 12 months).
4. **Model Selection and Training:**  Use a suitable machine learning library (scikit-learn, etc.) to train a decision tree classifier on your labeled data. Explore different depth limits and other hyperparameters to find the best model.
5. **Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluate the performance of your model using cross-validation and appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
6. **Refinement:** Iterate on steps 3-5, refining your features, model, and thresholds based on the evaluation results.  Consult with medical experts throughout the process to ensure clinical relevance.


By following these steps, you can develop a more robust and reliable decision tree model for predicting cartilage thickness changes after ACL injury.  Remember that this is a complex medical problem, and expert input is crucial.
