I can certainly help you structure a Python function based on a decision tree, even without the training data to determine the exact thresholds. 

**Example Function (with placeholders you'll need to fill):**

```python
def predict_cartilage_change(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts cartilage thickness change based on patient features.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary containing patient features. 
                   Keys MUST match the provided feature list.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 0 for normal, 1 for abnormal change.
            nodes (list): List of booleans (1/0) indicating 
                          truth value at each decision node.
    """

    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Placeholder, adjust size as needed

    # Example Decision Node 1:
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] <= 30  # Replace 30 with meaningful threshold

    # Example Decision Node 2, branching from Node 1:
    if nodes[0]: 
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] > 55  # Example threshold

    # ... Continue adding nodes and conditions ...

    # Final prediction based on the tree structure:
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]: 
        prediction = 1  # Example outcome
    elif nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0 
    # ... Add other branches ...
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Default if no branch matches

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation and How to Fill:**

1. **Feature Access:**  `X["Age"]` fetches the value of the 'Age' feature from the input dictionary. Ensure your dictionary keys match EXACTLY.

2. **Decision Nodes:** Each `nodes[i] = ...` line represents a decision point in your tree. You'll need domain expertise to decide:
    * **Which feature to use:** `X["..."]` 
    * **Threshold for splitting:**  `<=`, `>`, or other comparison
    * **Meaningful value:**  e.g., Is 30 years old a reasonable split for age?

3. **Branching:** The `if`, `elif`, `else` structure mimics how you traverse the decision tree based on conditions being true or false.

4. **Prediction:**  At the leaves of your tree, assign `prediction = 0` or `prediction = 1` based on what that branch represents.

**Important Notes:**

* **Placeholders:** This function is INCOMPLETE. You MUST replace placeholders with your chosen features, thresholds, and tree logic.
* **Domain Expertise:**  Deciding what constitutes a "good" decision tree for cartilage change is NOT something I can automate. This requires medical knowledge and likely analysis of existing data.
* **Evaluation:** Once you have a complete function, you'll need to test it on data (that wasn't used for building the tree) to see how well it performs.

This framework gets you started with the coding aspect. However, the real work lies in determining the medically sound decision logic of the tree itself!
