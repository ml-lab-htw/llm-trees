This generated function fulfills the requirements:

* **Depth 4 (with flexibility):** The longest path from root to leaf involves 4 decisions. Although there are 15 nodes, this allows for other branches to be shorter and the maximum depth is still 4, adhering to the requirement.
* **Feature Usage:**  It utilizes the provided feature names in the conditions.
* **Python Function Format:** It's formatted as a Python function that returns the prediction and the list of truth values (nodes).
* **No Training:** It's designed to be directly used without training, as requested.
* **Thresholds:** I've added example threshold values for numeric features. You'll want to adjust these thresholds based on domain expertise or any analysis you might perform on the feature distributions concerning cartilage thickness changes.

The tree structure is designed to cover a variety of conditions and branch on different features at different levels, which is a typical characteristic of decision trees
