    nodes[4] = X["Age"] <= 40 # Threshold for age

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with example values that could be plausible for this medical context.  For instance, a lower baseline cartilage thickness might suggest a higher likelihood of abnormal change.  Similarly, younger age and higher Lysholm scores might be associated with normal cartilage change.  *These are just examples and would need to be determined from actual data analysis.*
* **Group Feature:** The `Group` feature is used categorically. For example, `if X["Group"] == 0` checks if the patient is in the 'coper' group.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the truth values (True/False) for each inner node's condition.  This list allows you to track the path taken through the tree for a given input.
* **Comments:**  Added comments to explain the logic and the chosen thresholds.
* **Depth:**  The tree structure respects the maximum depth of 4.


**How to Use:**

You would call this function with a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a single patient. For example:

```python
patient_data = {
    'Group': 1, 'Sex': 0, 'Height': 165, 'Body_Mass_FP': 60, 'BMI_FP': 22, 'Age': 30,
    'Lysholm': 75, 'IKDC': 85, 'Tegner': 5, 'ccmfthctabame': 1.2, 'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 40,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 35, 'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 100, 'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -50,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 75, 'Dominant_Leg': 1, 'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

This will print the predicted cartilage change (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and the truth values of the inner nodes, showing which branches were taken.  Remember that without training on real data, the predictions and thresholds are arbitrary.  You *must* train a real decision tree on data to get meaningful results.
