```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Using baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 55 # Using superficial cartilage T2 values

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage change
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Abnormal cartilage change
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Abnormal cartilage change

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Thresholds:**

I've selected `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) and `ccMF.S.T2.Me` (baseline mean T2 values for superficial cartilage) as the two most important features for this hypothetical decision tree related to cartilage thickness change.  Here's the rationale:

* **`ccmfthctabame`:**  It's logical that a thinner baseline cartilage thickness might be more prone to abnormal change after injury. A threshold of 2.5 mm is chosen arbitrarily as an example â€“  in a real scenario, this would be determined by data analysis.
* **`ccMF.S.T2.Me`:** T2 values in MRI are sensitive to changes in cartilage composition and structure.  Higher T2 values can indicate early degeneration or damage.  A threshold of 55 ms is again an arbitrary example for demonstration.

The logic is that if both the baseline thickness is above a certain threshold *and* the T2 value is below a certain threshold (indicating healthier cartilage), the cartilage change is predicted as "normal" (0). Otherwise, if either the baseline thickness is low, or the T2 value is high (or both), the cartilage change is predicted as "abnormal" (1).

**Important Notes:**

* **No Data, No Training:** This decision tree is *not* trained. The feature selection, thresholds, and tree structure are entirely for illustrative purposes based on the provided feature descriptions and general domain knowledge.  In a real application, you would *absolutely* need to train a decision tree on actual data to get meaningful results.
* **Arbitrary Thresholds:** The threshold values (2.5 mm and 55 ms) are entirely arbitrary and used for demonstration.  In a real-world scenario, these would be determined through data analysis and model training.
* **Maximum Depth of 2:** The generated function adheres to the requirement of a maximum depth of 2, meaning it has at most two levels of decision nodes.
* **Feature Importance:** In a real application, feature importance would be assessed statistically using methods like feature importance scores from trained decision tree models or other feature selection techniques.


This example provides a framework for generating a Python function representing a decision tree.  Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds and potentially the chosen features with values derived from data analysis when working with a real dataset.
