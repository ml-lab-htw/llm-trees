**Explanation of Thresholds and Logic:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 1.8`:**  A hypothetical threshold.  Lower baseline cartilage thickness might suggest a greater risk of abnormal change even in copers.
* **`ccMF.D.T2.Me > 45`:** A reasonable threshold based on literature where higher T2 values are often associated with cartilage degeneration.  This is more relevant in non-copers who don't have the benefit of compensatory mechanisms.
* **`Lysholm <= 70`:** Lysholm scores below 70 are often considered fair or poor, potentially indicating functional limitations related to cartilage issues.
* **`Age > 30`:** Older patients generally have reduced healing capacity. This threshold acts as a proxy.
* **`ccMF.S.T2.Me > 35`:**  Post-surgery, the superficial layer's T2 values are crucial.  A higher threshold here reflects the expected initial inflammation but still flags potential issues.



**Important Notes:**

* These threshold values are *estimated* and should be optimized with real data using a machine learning algorithm.  The structure and logic of the tree are more important than the precise numbers.
* This function assumes the input `X` is a dictionary where keys are the feature names (exactly as specified) and values are the feature values.
* The output `nodes` list provides insight into which branches of the tree were taken for a given input. This can be valuable for debugging and understanding the decision-making process.


This improved function now returns both the prediction and the `nodes` list as requested, and it includes more reasonable threshold values.  However, without actual data, it's impossible to validate the effectiveness of this decision tree.  You must train and evaluate it on a real dataset for meaningful results.
