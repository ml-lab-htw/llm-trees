    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.8  # Threshold 1: Below 1.8mm suggests thinner cartilage
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30             # Threshold 2: Above 30 years increases risk

    if nodes[0]:  # Thinner cartilage

            prediction = 0  # Normal - Copers assumed to recover better even with thinner cartilage initially
        else:               # Non-coper or Surgical Reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal - Higher risk even with thicker cartilage
    else:           # Thicker cartilage
        if nodes[1]: # Younger than 30
            prediction = 0  # Normal - Younger individuals might recover even with moderately thick cartilage
        else:          # Older than 30

**Explanation and Justification of Choices and Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame` (Threshold 1: 1.8mm):** This threshold represents a hypothetical value below which cartilage is considered relatively thin.  The actual optimal threshold would need to be determined from data analysis.  I've chosen 1.8mm as an example.
* **`Age` (Threshold 2: 30 years):**  This threshold reflects the assumption that cartilage healing becomes less efficient after a certain age.  Again, 30 is a placeholder, and the true optimal value would come from data analysis.
* **`Group`:** The logic incorporates the `Group` feature directly at the first level, reflecting the hypothesis that the treatment group is a strong predictor of outcome.  Coper (0) is considered a lower risk group.


**Important Notes:**

* **No Training Data:** This function implements a decision tree without any training. The thresholds and branches are based on hypothetical assumptions.
* **Feature Importance:** The chosen features and their order in the tree reflect a hypothetical understanding of their importance.  In a real application, feature importance should be derived from data analysis.
* **Simplified Tree:** A depth of 2 is extremely shallow. A real-world model would likely benefit from greater depth or a different model architecture to capture the complexity of cartilage healing.
* **Units:** Pay careful attention to the units of the features. The chosen thresholds depend on those units (e.g., mm for cartilage thickness, years for age).


This improved version addresses all the requirements of the prompt, including using specified feature names, providing concrete thresholds, returning both the prediction and the node truth values, and adhering to the requested function format. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with data-driven values when you have a training dataset.
