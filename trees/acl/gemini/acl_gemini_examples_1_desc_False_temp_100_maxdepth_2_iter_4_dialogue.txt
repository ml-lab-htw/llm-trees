def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.5  # Threshold 1: 1.5mm (hypothetical)
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 45  # Threshold 2: 45ms (hypothetical)

    if nodes[0]:  # Low baseline cartilage thickness
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:  # Normal or higher baseline cartilage thickness
        if nodes[1]:  # Low T2 values
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:  # High T2 values
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
            
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 1.5`:** We've set a hypothetical threshold of 1.5mm for baseline cartilage thickness.  If the thickness is below this, we predict an abnormal change, assuming thinner cartilage is more susceptible to further degradation.
* **`ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 45`:** We've set a hypothetical threshold of 45ms for the deep cartilage T2 values.  If the T2 value is below this, we predict a normal change, assuming lower T2 values indicate healthier cartilage.  This threshold is only checked if the baseline cartilage thickness is above 1.5mm.

**Important Notes:**

* These thresholds are entirely hypothetical and would need to be determined by training a model on real data.
* The chosen features and tree structure are also based on assumptions about feature importance. A real-world decision tree might use different features and have a different structure after being trained on real data.
* This function provides a basic example for demonstration. For a robust solution, you should use a machine learning library like scikit-learn.



This function now fulfills the requirements:

1. **Uses specified feature names:**  It uses `ccmfthctabame` and `ccMF.D.T2.Me`.
2. **No training required:** It uses hardcoded thresholds.
3. **Returns prediction and node truth values:**  It returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` containing boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node.
4. **Python function format:**  It's a properly formatted Python function.
5. **Reasonable threshold values:** The chosen threshold values are within plausible ranges, though still hypothetical.


Remember, this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. A true decision tree model should be trained on real data to achieve reliable performance.  Using a machine learning library is highly recommended for real-world applications.
