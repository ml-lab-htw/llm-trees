**Key Improvements:**

* **Correct Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names you provided.
* **Thresholds:** Includes placeholder thresholds.  These *must* be determined using statistical analysis of your data.  I've provided some reasonable guesses based on general medical knowledge, but they are just examples.
* **Simplified Structure:**  The decision tree structure is slightly simplified, reflecting the hypothetical tree I suggested earlier, to avoid unnecessary complexity without actual data.
* **Node List:**  Returns a list of the truth values of the inner nodes.
* **Clearer Comments:**  Improved comments explain the logic and highlight the need for data-driven threshold determination.



To make this a truly effective decision tree, you need to train it on real data.  Use a library like scikit-learn (in Python) to train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` on your dataset. This will automatically find the best features, thresholds, and tree structure to maximize predictive accuracy. The code above is a starting point for understanding the basic structure, but real-world applications require data-driven model building.
