def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Threshold for cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # Surgical reconstruction group

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal - Above threshold thickness likely normal
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal - Below threshold and surgical reconstruction
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal - Below threshold but not surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 0.8`:**  I've set a hypothetical threshold of 0.8mm for baseline cartilage thickness.  This is a placeholder! In a real application, this value would be determined by analyzing the distribution of cartilage thickness in your dataset and finding a split point that best separates normal and abnormal outcomes.  Medical literature or expert consultation would be invaluable in determining a clinically meaningful threshold.  Thicker cartilage is generally healthier, so a value below a certain point might indicate a higher risk of abnormal change.
* **`Group == 2`:** This directly uses the provided encoding for the `Group` feature, where 2 represents "surgical reconstruction".  The assumption is that surgical intervention is associated with a greater likelihood of cartilage thickness changes.


**Important Notes:**

* **Placeholder Thresholds:** The 0.8mm threshold is an educated guess. You **must** replace this with a data-driven value when you have a real dataset.  Use techniques like cross-validation to find the optimal threshold.
* **Feature Importance:**  This tree uses `ccmfthctabame` and `Group` as the primary predictors based on the earlier discussion.  With actual data, you might discover that other features are more important.
* **Tree Depth:** The function implements the requested depth of 2.
* **Truth Values List (nodes):**  The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (True/False, which are equivalent to 1/0) of each decision node. This is useful for understanding the path taken by each prediction.


This revised function provides a working template.  Remember to adjust the threshold based on your data and consider incorporating other potentially relevant features for improved accuracy. Using a machine learning library will automate the process of finding the best thresholds and feature splits.  This example is a starting point to illustrate the concept.
