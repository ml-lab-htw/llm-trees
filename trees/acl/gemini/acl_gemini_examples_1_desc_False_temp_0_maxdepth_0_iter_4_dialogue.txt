**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (`ccmfthctabame_threshold`, `lysholm_threshold`, `deep_t2_threshold`) are crucial.  I've set placeholder values.  You *must* determine appropriate thresholds based on data analysis (e.g., looking at distributions, using statistical tests, or as part of the decision tree training process).
* **Feature Importance:**  The structure of the tree reflects a *hypothetical* order of feature importance.  In a real application, the decision tree algorithm would determine the best features and split points based on the training data.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Ensure your data is preprocessed correctly before using this function.  Categorical features like `Group` and `Sex` are already numerically encoded as described in your prompt, so no further conversion within the function is needed.
* **Missing Values:**  The provided code does not handle missing values.  You should add checks for missing data and implement appropriate strategies (e.g., imputation or skipping instances) in a real-world application.
* **Evaluation:**  After training a decision tree on real data, thoroughly evaluate its performance on a held-out test set to ensure it generalizes well.


This improved version provides a functional Python implementation based on the hypothetical tree structure and addresses key points for a real-world application. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with data-driven values and evaluate the tree's performance.
