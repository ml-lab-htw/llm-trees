def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X['ccmfthctabame'] <= 1.5  # Threshold for cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] <= 45  # Threshold for deep cartilage T2 values
    nodes[2] = X['Group'] == 0  # Check if the group is 'coper' (0)

    if nodes[0]:  # Branch 1: Cartilage thickness <= 1.5mm
        if nodes[1]:  # Branch 1.1: Deep cartilage T2 <= 45ms
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:  # Branch 1.2: Deep cartilage T2 > 45ms
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:  # Branch 2: Cartilage thickness > 1.5mm
        if nodes[2]:  # Branch 2.1: Group is 'coper'
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:  # Branch 2.2: Group is 'noncoper' or 'surgical reconstruction'
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've replaced `Threshold1` and `Threshold2` with plausible values (1.5 mm for cartilage thickness and 45 ms for T2 values).  These are just examples and would need to be determined from real data analysis.
* **Group Encoding:**  The code now explicitly checks if `X['Group'] == 0` to correspond to the 'coper' group encoding.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of each inner node's condition.  This provides a record of the path taken through the tree for a given input.
* **Type Hinting:** Added type hinting (`X: dict`) for better code readability and maintainability.


This function directly implements the decision tree logic described previously.  It takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input and returns both the predicted cartilage change outcome (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and the list of truth values for the decision nodes. This latter part is crucial for understanding the decision-making process of the tree. Remember that this function's performance depends entirely on how well the chosen thresholds and features reflect the real-world relationship between these factors and cartilage change.  Training on actual data is essential for creating a robust and reliable predictive model.
