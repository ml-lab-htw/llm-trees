```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.0  # Using baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 50  # Using baseline deep cartilage T2 values

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal change
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal change
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Abnormal change

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

For this problem related to cartilage thickness change after ACL injury, I chose `ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness) and `ccMF.D.T2.Me` (baseline deep cartilage T2 values) as the most important features.  These features are likely directly related to cartilage health and potential for change following injury. The reasoning behind the chosen thresholds (2.0 for thickness and 50 for T2) is illustrative. In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be learned from data.

The tree structure reflects a hypothetical relationship where thinner baseline cartilage and higher T2 values (indicating potential damage) are associated with abnormal cartilage thickness change over time.  A thinner baseline cartilage thickness could mean that there's less room for further cartilage loss before becoming abnormal. Similarly, higher T2 values can indicate increased water content in cartilage, which is associated with cartilage degeneration and a higher chance of worsening change over time.

**Important Notes:**

* **No Data Used:** This decision tree is *not* trained on any data. The features, thresholds, and structure are chosen based on reasonable assumptions about the domain.  The effectiveness of this tree on real data is unknown.
* **Simplification:** A real-world solution would involve training a decision tree on a dataset using a suitable algorithm (like CART) to determine the optimal features, thresholds, and tree depth.
* **Depth Constraint:** The tree respects the maximum depth constraint of 2, resulting in at most three inner nodes (including the root).


This revised answer provides a more relevant and interpretable decision tree for the provided features and target variable, while still adhering to the prompt's requirements for generating the function without training.  Remember that this is a demonstration, and real-world application requires data-driven training.
