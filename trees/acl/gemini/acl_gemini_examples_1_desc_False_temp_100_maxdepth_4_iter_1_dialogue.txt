Key Improvements:

* **Correct Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided.
* **Realistic Thresholds:**  Includes placeholder thresholds that are at least somewhat plausible based on general medical knowledge.  These would be learned from data in a real training scenario.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure directly mirrors the decision tree logic.
* **Target Encoding:**  Returns 0 for "normal" and 1 for "abnormal" as specified.
* **Node Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) of each decision node's condition.


This function is still a *hypothetical* example.  The actual decision boundaries and feature importance would be determined by training a model on a real dataset. Using this function with real patient data without training is not recommended.
