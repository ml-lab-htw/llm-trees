```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Threshold set to 0.8mm - a reasonable guess, but needs data validation

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal if baseline thickness is low
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Normal if baseline thickness is higher

    return prediction, nodes
