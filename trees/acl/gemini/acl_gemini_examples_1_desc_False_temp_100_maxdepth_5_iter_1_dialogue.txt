This function now includes a list called `nodes` that stores the boolean result of each comparison made at a node in the decision tree.  This provides a record of the path taken through the tree for a given input.  The thresholds used are examples and should be adjusted based on domain knowledge or feature importance analysis of real data if available.  The structure reflects a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 (although not all branches reach that depth in this example).  The tree structure itself is arbitrary in this example because it was created without training data.  Remember that the quality of the predictions made by this function heavily depends on having realistic threshold values in the decision tree.  When you have real data, you should train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` to obtain a tree with data-driven thresholds and structure, like the example in my previous response.  This handcrafted tree is just a placeholder until you can train a proper model.
