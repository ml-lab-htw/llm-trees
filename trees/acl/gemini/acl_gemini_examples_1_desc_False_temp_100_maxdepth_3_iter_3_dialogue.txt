    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Threshold1: Assuming 0.8mm as a hypothetical threshold for thin cartilage
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 45  # Threshold2: Assuming 45ms as a hypothetical threshold for high T2 values
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # Check if group is surgical reconstruction (2)

        if nodes[1]:  # Deep cartilage T2 below threshold
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:  # Deep cartilage T2 above threshold

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Thresholds:** The thresholds (0.8mm for cartilage thickness and 45ms for T2 values) are entirely hypothetical and chosen for demonstration purposes.  In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be determined by analyzing actual data and likely wouldn't be single fixed values.
* **Feature Importance:** This tree assumes `ccmfthctabame`, `ccMF.D.T2.Me`, and `Group` are the most important features. This is a simplification. With real data, feature importance would be assessed during model training.
* **No Data, No Real Tree:**  This function only implements a pre-defined, hypothetical tree structure.  It does not learn from data.  To create a valid decision tree model, you *must* provide a dataset with patient data and outcomes.
* **Oversimplification:** A depth-3 tree is likely too simple for a complex medical problem.  A more complex tree (or another machine learning model) might be needed after analyzing real data.


This refined code addresses the prompt's requirements by:

* Using the specified feature names.
* Implementing the logic of the hypothetical decision tree.
* Providing a function that returns both the prediction and a list of the truth values for the inner nodes.
* Filling in placeholder thresholds with (hypothetical) values.


Remember to replace this hypothetical tree with one trained on real data for any clinical application. This is crucial for accurate and reliable predictions.
