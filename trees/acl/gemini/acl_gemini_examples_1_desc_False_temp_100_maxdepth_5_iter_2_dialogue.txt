**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Thresholds:**  The thresholds (0.8, 45, 70, 30, 75) are *completely hypothetical*.  In a real application, these would be learned from the data during the training process.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code assumes the feature encoding you provided (e.g., 0 for coper, 1 for female, etc.). Ensure your input data `X` adheres to this encoding.
* **No Data or Training:**  This function *does not* perform any data analysis or model training. It simply implements the hypothetical decision tree structure outlined previously.
* **Medical Application:**  This is a simplified example and should *not* be used for actual medical decision-making.  A real clinical application requires rigorous model development, validation, and interpretation by medical professionals.




This revised code fulfills the request to format the hypothetical tree as a Python function with the specified features and output format. Remember that this remains a demonstration and is not suitable for clinical use without proper training and validation on real data.
