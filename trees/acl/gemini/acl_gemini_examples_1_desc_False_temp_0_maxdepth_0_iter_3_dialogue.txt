**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 1.5`:**  A lower baseline cartilage thickness suggests a higher risk of abnormal change, especially in copers. 1.5mm is a somewhat arbitrary but plausible threshold.
* **`ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 45`:** Higher T2 values indicate cartilage damage. 45ms is a reasonable estimate based on some literature, but this is variable.
* **`Lysholm <= 70`:** A lower Lysholm score indicates worse function, suggesting a potentially worse prognosis. 70 is often considered a cutoff for acceptable function.
* **`days_injury_to_MRI <= 90`:**  Earlier MRIs might show less initial damage, leading to a better prognosis. 90 days is a reasonable timeframe for early assessment.
* **`IKDC <= 75`:** A lower IKDC score after surgery suggests a worse outcome. 75 is a plausible threshold based on typical IKDC score interpretations.


**Important Notes:**

* These thresholds are educated guesses. Real-world thresholds would be learned from data using a decision tree algorithm.
* The structure of the tree and the feature importance are hypothetical.  A decision tree algorithm would determine the best structure based on data.
* The function returns a prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of each decision node, following the requested format.  This allows tracing the path taken through the tree for a given input.


This improved answer provides a more complete Python function, reasonable threshold values, and an explanation of the chosen features and thresholds.  Remember to replace these placeholder thresholds with values learned from your data when you train a real decision tree model.
