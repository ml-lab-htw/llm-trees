You're asking to generate a decision tree function **without the actual decision tree** or training data. It's like requesting directions without knowing the destination or starting point.

The provided examples use Iris dataset features, not the ACL injury features you described. This mismatch makes it impossible to create a meaningful function.

**To proceed, you need to:**

1. **Train a Decision Tree:** Use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) to train a decision tree model using your ACL injury dataset. The training process will determine the important features, thresholds, and structure of the tree.

2. **Extract Decision Tree Logic:**  Once trained, you can extract the decision tree's logic (feature splits, thresholds) and represent it as a Python function.

**Example (Illustrative, NOT using your data):**

```python

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] <= 30
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] > 2.5 
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70 

    if nodes[0]: 
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage change
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage change
            else:
                prediction = 0 
        else:
            prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```
