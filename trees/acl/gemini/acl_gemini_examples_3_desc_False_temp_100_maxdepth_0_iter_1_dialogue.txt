I understand the format you need. However, I cannot provide a decision tree with specific thresholds for your cartilage thickness problem *without data*. 

The examples you gave still use Iris dataset features (petal length, etc.), not your medical features.  A decision tree is built by learning from data, finding which features and what split points best separate the "normal" from "abnormal" cases.

**Here's a template for the function, but the thresholds will be placeholders:**

```python
def predict_cartilage_change(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts cartilage thickness change (0=normal, 1=abnormal) based on features.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of patient features (see feature descriptions above).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 0 or 1 (normal/abnormal)
            nodes (list): Truth values (0/1) for each inner node condition.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Assuming a 5-node tree for now, adjust as needed

    # Node 1: Example, replace with meaningful feature and threshold
    nodes[0] = X['Age'] <= 30 

    # Node 2: (Adapt based on tree structure you expect)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] > 60 
    else:
        nodes[1] = X['Lysholm'] < 80

    # ... (Continue for other nodes) ...

    # Example final prediction logic (adapt as needed)
    if nodes[3] and not nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Normal

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Once you provide the dataset, I can:**

1. **Train a decision tree:** Learn the actual feature splits and thresholds.
2. **Fill in the function:** Replace the placeholders with meaningful values.

Remember, this is just a starting point. The complexity and accuracy of the tree depend heavily on the data you provide.
