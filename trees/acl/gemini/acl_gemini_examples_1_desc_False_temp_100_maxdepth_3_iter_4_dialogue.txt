This function implements the hypothetical decision tree logic described previously, using the specified feature names and encoding.  The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the decision nodes, as requested. Remember that without real data and training, this function's predictive accuracy is unknown and likely poor. It's designed to demonstrate the requested formatting and logic based on assumed thresholds.
