```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Hypothetical tree based on potentially relevant features (no data used)
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.7  # Example threshold - no data to determine this!
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # Surgical reconstruction

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Abnormal - Thin cartilage and surgery could suggest issues
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Normal - Thin cartilage but conservative treatment
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Normal - Thicker cartilage likely healthier

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Important Notes:**

* This function implements a *hypothetical* decision tree.  The chosen features (`ccmfthctabame` and `Group`), the thresholds (0.7 for cartilage thickness), and the resulting predictions are purely speculative.  *Without actual data, it's impossible to create a reliable and meaningful decision tree.*
* The function returns a prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision nodes. This allows you to inspect which branches of the tree were taken for a given input.
*  To create a truly useful decision tree, you must provide a dataset with values for the features and the corresponding cartilage thickness change outcomes.  I can then train a decision tree model on this data, determine optimal feature splits and thresholds, and provide a much more accurate and reliable prediction function.
