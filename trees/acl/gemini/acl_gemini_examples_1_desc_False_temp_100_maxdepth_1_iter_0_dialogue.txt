```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.0  # Threshold set to 2.0mm - a reasonable guess

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage change

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Justification of Threshold:**

* **`ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness):** As explained previously, this is the most directly relevant feature for predicting *change* in thickness.

* **Threshold of 2.0mm:**  This is a reasoned guess.  Cartilage thickness in the medial femur can vary, but values below 2.0mm might already indicate some thinning or early degenerative changes, making further decline more likely.  This threshold would need to be validated and refined with actual data.  A higher threshold would mean that only more severely thinned cartilage at baseline would be classified as predicting abnormal change.

* **Depth-1 Simplicity:** The function directly reflects the depth-1 decision tree structure, using a single conditional statement based on the chosen feature and threshold.

* **Truth Values (Nodes List):**  The `nodes` list stores the truth value (True or False, represented as 1 or 0 in other examples) of the condition at the root node.  This fulfills the requirement of tracking the decision path.

**Important Considerations:**

This function is a simplified demonstration. A real-world application would require:

* **Data-Driven Threshold:**  The 2.0mm threshold is a placeholder.  Machine learning algorithms determine the optimal threshold based on training data.
* **Model Evaluation:**  The performance of this simple classifier needs to be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) on a separate test dataset.
* **Model Complexity:** A depth-1 tree is severely limited.  A more complex tree or a different model entirely (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machine) would likely be necessary for a more accurate and robust prediction.
