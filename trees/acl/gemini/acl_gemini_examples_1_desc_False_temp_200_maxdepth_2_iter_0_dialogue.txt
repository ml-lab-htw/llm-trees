            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:  # Cartilage thickness above threshold
        if nodes[1]:  # T2 below threshold
            prediction = 0  # Normal

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've added placeholder values for `thickness_threshold` and `t2_threshold`.  In a real application, these would be determined by analyzing the data and training a decision tree model.  The values used here are purely for illustration.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The code uses the provided feature encoding (0, 1, 2 for Group; 0, 1 for Sex, etc.)
* **Feature Names:**  The code uses the exact feature names provided (e.g., "ccmfthctabame", "ccMF.D.T2.Me").
* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic described previously.
* **Comments:** Added comments to explain the reasoning behind the chosen thresholds and branching logic.

**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'Group': 1,  # Non-coper
    'Sex': 0,  # Female
    'Height': 165,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 60,
    'BMI_FP': 22,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 80,
    'IKDC': 75,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': 0.7,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 50,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 40,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 100,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -50,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 75,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,  # Right
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

This would output:

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [True, False]
```

Because the cartilage thickness is below the threshold (0.7 < 0.8), the first node is True.  The patient is in the non-coper group (Group != 0), so the prediction becomes 1 (abnormal). The second node evaluation (T2) becomes irrelevant because we've already made a prediction.



This improved version is more functional, uses the correct feature names and encoding, and includes more realistic placeholder values for demonstration.  Remember to replace these placeholders with actual values derived from data analysis and model training in a real-world application.
