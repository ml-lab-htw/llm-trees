```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 0  # coper
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.5

    if nodes[0]:  # coper group
        if nodes[1]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 1.5 mm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal (higher threshold for normal in copers)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # non-coper or surgical reconstruction group
        if nodes[1]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 1.5 mm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal (lower threshold for normal)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Adjustment:** The threshold for `ccmfthctabame` is kept at 1.5mm for both branches, reflecting the idea that even though copers might maintain cartilage better, a lower baseline thickness still suggests a risk of future degradation. This acknowledges the limited depth and the absence of true data-driven thresholds.  A more complex tree could use different thresholds.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted for better readability and uses comments to explain the logic.
* **Consistency with Problem Description:** The function adheres to the specified input format (dictionary `X`) and output format (prediction and `nodes` list).
* **Target Variable Encoding:** The prediction uses 0 for normal and 1 for abnormal, matching the given target variable encoding.



**Important Reminders:**

This function represents a simplified decision tree based on assumed relationships and thresholds.  A real-world application would require training a decision tree model on actual data to learn the optimal structure, feature importance, and thresholds.  The chosen features and threshold values are placeholders and may not accurately reflect the true relationships in a real-world dataset. This example serves as a template demonstrating how to translate a conceptual decision tree into a Python function for prediction and interpretation.
