I understand now. You want a Python function representing a decision tree for predicting cartilage thickness change, along with the truth values of the decision nodes. 

**Important:** Since I don't have real data, the thresholds below are chosen for illustration and should **NOT** be considered medically accurate. 

```python
def predict_cartilage_change(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts cartilage thickness change (normal/abnormal) based on patient features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing patient features. 
                   See feature descriptions for expected keys.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) 
               prediction: 0 for normal, 1 for abnormal
               nodes: List of truth values (0/1) for each decision node.
    """

    nodes = 4 * [None] 

    # Decision Node 1: Age and Baseline Thickness
    nodes[0] = X['Age'] <= 30  
    nodes[1] = X['ccmfthctabame'] <= 1.8

    # Decision Node 2: Group
    nodes[2] = X['Group'] == 2  # Surgical reconstruction

    # Decision Node 3: T2 Values
    nodes[3] = X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] - X['ccMF.S.T2.Me'] >= 10  # Difference in T2 values

    if nodes[0] and nodes[1]: 
        # Younger and thinner cartilage at baseline 
        prediction = 0  # More likely normal change
    elif nodes[2]:
        # Surgical reconstruction, regardless of other factors
        prediction = 1  # More likely abnormal change
    elif nodes[3]:
        # Large difference in deep/superficial T2 values
        prediction = 1  # More likely abnormal
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Default to normal if other conditions not met 

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage
patient_data = {
    'Group': 1, 
    'Sex': 0, 
    'Height': 165, 
    'Body_Mass_FP': 60, 
    'BMI_FP': 22, 
    'Age': 25, 
    'Lysholm': 80, 
    'IKDC': 70, 
    'Tegner': 4, 
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.0, 
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 45, 
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 38, 
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 100, 
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -50, 
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 150, 
    'Dominant_Leg': 0, 
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 14
}

prediction, nodes = predict_cartilage_change(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Abnormal' if prediction == 1 else 'Normal'}")
print(f"Decision Node Values: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict_cartilage_change` function takes a dictionary of patient features and returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the truth values of the decision nodes.
2. **Decision Nodes:**  The code defines 4 decision nodes with example conditions. These conditions would be determined by a real decision tree algorithm based on data patterns. 
3. **Prediction Logic:** The `if/elif/else` block implements the decision tree logic, classifying the example based on the node values.

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. A true decision tree would be built using a machine learning library (like scikit-learn in Python) and trained on your dataset to determine the optimal structure, features, and thresholds.
