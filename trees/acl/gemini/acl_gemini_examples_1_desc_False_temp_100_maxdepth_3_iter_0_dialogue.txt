def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 0  # coper
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Baseline cartilage thickness threshold
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70  # Lysholm score threshold


    if nodes[0]:  # coper
        if nodes[1]: # Low baseline cartilage thickness
            prediction = 1 # Abnormal
        else:  # Higher baseline cartilage thickness
            prediction = 0 # Normal
    elif X["Group"] == 1:  # noncoper
        if nodes[2]:  # Low Lysholm score
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:  # Higher Lysholm score
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:  # surgical reconstruction (Group == 2)
        if X["Lysholm"] <= 80:  # Slightly higher Lysholm threshold
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:  # Higher Lysholm score
            prediction = 0 # Normal

    return prediction, nodes

Key improvements in this version:

* **Correct Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names you provided (e.g., "Group", "ccmfthctabame", "Lysholm").
* **Thresholds:**  Includes plausible threshold values for the decision logic.
* **Group Handling:**  Explicitly handles all three groups (coper, noncoper, surgical reconstruction).
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/elif/else` structure makes the decision logic easier to follow.
* **`nodes` List:** Properly populates the `nodes` list with the truth values of the decision conditions.
* **Consistent Encoding:** Adheres to the provided encoding for the target variable (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and the `Group` feature.



This function now accurately reflects the previously described hypothetical decision tree logic, using the correct feature names and encoding.  Remember that this is still a hypothetical tree; real-world thresholds and feature importance would be determined by training on a dataset.
