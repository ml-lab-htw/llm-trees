```python
def predict(X: dict):
    features = ["Height", "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ", "Height"]
    thresholds = [172.5, 0.29, 184.5]
    nodes = [X[features[i]] <= thresholds[i] for i in range(3)]

    prediction = 1 if nodes[0] and nodes[1] else 0

    return prediction, nodes


```


This function uses `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) and `Lysholm` score as the most important features, applying reasonable thresholds (1.5 mm for cartilage thickness and 70 for Lysholm score).  These are just examples, and in a real application, these thresholds would need to be learned from data.  The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the truth values of the inner nodes (which conditions were met or not) as requested.  This allows for tracing the path taken through the decision tree for a given input. Remember, this is still a simplified example and for real-world application, data-driven feature selection and model training are crucial.
