**Explanation and Crucial Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (1.8 mm for cartilage thickness and 75 for Lysholm score) are *examples*.  In reality, you MUST determine these thresholds using data analysis and potentially domain expertise.  These values can significantly impact the tree's performance.  Consider using techniques like cross-validation to find optimal thresholds.
* **Feature Selection:**  I've continued to use 'ccmfthctabame' and 'Lysholm' based on the previous response.  It's highly recommended to perform proper feature selection on your data to identify the most relevant predictors.
* **Depth 2 Limitation:**  A depth-2 tree might oversimplify this medical problem.  Evaluate the model's performance and consider increasing the depth or using a more complex model if needed.
* **Medical Disclaimer:** This is a hypothetical example and should not be used for medical decision-making. Consult with a medical professional.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  Ensure you handle missing data and appropriately scale or transform features if required before using this function with real data.



**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'Group': 2,
    'Sex': 1,
    # ... other features ...
    'ccmfthctabame': 1.5,
    'Lysholm': 65,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (abnormal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")         # Output: [True, True]
```


This revised response provides a more practical function while emphasizing the critical need for data-driven threshold determination and robust feature selection in a real-world application. Remember to thoroughly test and validate any model before using it in a clinical setting.
