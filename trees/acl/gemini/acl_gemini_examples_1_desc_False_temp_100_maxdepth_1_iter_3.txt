```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.95  # Using baseline cartilage thickness

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Predict normal cartilage change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Predict abnormal cartilage change
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of Decision Tree Generation (without data):**

Since we are generating the decision tree *without training on data*, we need to make a reasonable guess for the split condition. I've chosen `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) as the feature for the root node. This is based on the assumption that a lower initial cartilage thickness might be associated with a higher risk of abnormal change over time.  The threshold value of `1.95` is arbitrarily chosen for demonstration.  In a real-world scenario with data, this threshold would be determined by the decision tree learning algorithm to maximize information gain or minimize impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy).

The prediction labels (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) are also assigned based on the split. If the baseline thickness is less than or equal to the threshold, we predict normal change; otherwise, we predict abnormal change.  Again, with real data, the algorithm would determine the best predictions based on the distribution of the target variable in the resulting branches.


**Important Considerations:**

* **No Data:**  Because no training data is provided, this decision tree is not data-driven. It's a demonstration of the structure and format. The chosen feature and threshold are examples and might not be meaningful in practice.
* **Maximum Depth 1:** The generated tree has a maximum depth of 1, meaning it has a single split. This significantly limits its complexity.
* **Feature Importance (without data):** Without data, there's no way to determine feature importance empirically.  The chosen feature is a guess based on domain intuition (cartilage thickness seems relevant to cartilage change).
* **Real-World Application:** To build a useful decision tree classifier, you'll need training data and a decision tree learning algorithm (like those found in scikit-learn) to find the optimal splits, features, and predictions based on the patterns in your data.
