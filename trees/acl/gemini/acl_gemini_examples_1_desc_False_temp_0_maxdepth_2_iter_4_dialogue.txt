**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Feature Keys:** Uses the correct feature keys you provided (e.g., "ccmfthctabame", "Lysholm").
* **Thresholds:** Includes example thresholds for `ccmfthctabame` and `Lysholm`.  These are placeholders and *must* be replaced with values determined through analysis of a real dataset.
* **Decision Logic:**  Implements the decision tree logic based on the chosen features and thresholds.
* **Return Values:** Returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of boolean values for the inner nodes.
* **Example Usage:** Shows how to use the `predict` function with example feature data.  Remember to replace this example with your actual data.

**Crucial Next Steps:**

1. **Dataset:** Acquire a labeled dataset with the features and the target variable (cartilage thickness change: 0 or 1).
2. **Model Training:** Use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) to train a decision tree classifier on your dataset.  This will determine the optimal tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds.  The code provided here is just a template; the actual tree structure and thresholds will depend on your data.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and generalizability.


This revised version provides a functional Python implementation.  However, the accuracy and usefulness of the model entirely depend on using a real dataset and training it appropriately.
