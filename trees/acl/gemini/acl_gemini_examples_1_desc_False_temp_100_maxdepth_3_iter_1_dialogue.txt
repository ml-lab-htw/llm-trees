**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* `cartilage_thickness_threshold = 2.5`:  This assumes that a baseline cartilage thickness below 2.5mm might be more susceptible to further degradation after ACL injury.
* `lysholm_score_threshold = 80`: This assumes that a Lysholm score below 80 might indicate poorer functional outcomes and potentially be associated with abnormal cartilage changes.  

**Important Reminders:**

* These thresholds are hypothetical examples.  In a real application, these values would be determined by training a decision tree model on a dataset.
* The provided function implements the previously defined decision tree structure directly. It does not perform any learning or optimization.
* This is a simplified example.  A true clinical decision support system would need more sophisticated modeling and validation.  Furthermore, feature importance and thresholds should be determined based on actual clinical data and expert knowledge.
