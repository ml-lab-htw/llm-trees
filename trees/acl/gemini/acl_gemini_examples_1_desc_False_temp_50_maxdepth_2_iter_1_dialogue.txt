def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Using ccmfthctabame and Group as the most important features
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.8  # Threshold1: Example value, needs to be learned from data
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 0  #  coper (0) or not

    if nodes[0]:  # Low baseline cartilage thickness
        prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:         # High baseline cartilage thickness
        if nodes[1]: # coper
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:         # non-coper or surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold for `ccmfthctabame`:**  I've set a placeholder threshold of 1.8 mm. In a real application, this threshold needs to be learned from data during the training of the decision tree model.  You would use a dataset with known cartilage change outcomes to train a model, and the algorithm would determine the optimal threshold.
* **Group Split:** The second split is based on the `Group`. We hypothesize that copers are more likely to have normal cartilage change even with thicker baseline cartilage.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code assumes the `Group` feature is already encoded as 0, 1, and 2, as specified in your description.
* **Missing Feature Importance Calculation:** This code doesn't calculate feature importance. You'd typically use libraries like scikit-learn to train a decision tree on a dataset.  The training process automatically determines feature importance and the best splits.
* **Depth Limitation:** The code strictly adheres to a depth of 2.  A more complex tree might be necessary for better accuracy, but this fulfills the requirements of the prompt.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'Group': 1,  # non-coper
    'Sex': 0,
    'Height': 170,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 70,
    'BMI_FP': 24.2,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 80,
    'IKDC': 75,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.0, # Above the threshold
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 40,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 35,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 150,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -100,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 50,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Abnormal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```


This improved version addresses the specific format requirements and provides a more realistic example, although a true implementation requires a training dataset and a machine learning library. Remember that the performance of this simplified model is likely to be limited, and further refinement is usually necessary in a real-world application.
