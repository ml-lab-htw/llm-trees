Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Logic:

This decision tree prioritizes features likely related to cartilage health and change following an ACL injury:

1. **BMI_FP:**  Higher BMI is often associated with poorer cartilage health and potentially slower recovery.
2. **Age:** Older individuals generally have less cartilage regenerative capacity.
3. **ccMF.D.T2.Me (Baseline deep cartilage T2 values):**  Higher T2 values in the deep cartilage layers at baseline could indicate more significant initial damage, potentially influencing the long-term change.
4. **Lysholm Score:**  A functional outcome score; lower scores indicate greater impairment and potentially a worse prognosis for cartilage recovery.

The tree logic aims to capture different scenarios based on these factors. For instance, an older, overweight individual with high initial cartilage T2 values and poor functional scores is more likely to experience abnormal cartilage thickness changes. Conversely, a younger, normal-weight individual with low initial T2 values and good functional scores is predicted to have normal changes.

Important Note: This decision tree is synthetically generated based on assumed relationships between the features and the target variable.  It is not trained on actual data, so its accuracy is unknown and likely poor in a real-world scenario.  A real decision tree should be trained using a labeled dataset to achieve reliable predictions.  This example serves only to demonstrate the desired format and logic of the function.
