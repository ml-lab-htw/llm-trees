This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree structure from the previous response, using the specified feature names and reasonable threshold values.  Remember that this is still a hypothetical example and would need to be trained on actual data for real-world application.  The `nodes` list provides a way to track which branches of the decision tree were taken for a given input. This can be useful for understanding the decision-making process of the tree.
