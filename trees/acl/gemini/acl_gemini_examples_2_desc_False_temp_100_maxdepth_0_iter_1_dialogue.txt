**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - Takes a dictionary `X` containing patient features.
   - Returns the prediction (0 or 1) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner decision nodes.

2. **Decision Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]`:  Checks if baseline cartilage thickness change is above a threshold (1.2mm). 
   - `nodes[1]`:  Checks if the patient's age is below 25 (assuming younger = higher risk).
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the Lysholm score is below 80 (lower scores = worse function).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the deep cartilage T2 value is above 45 (higher could mean damage).

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - The `if/else` structure implements the decision tree logic, following the thresholds defined in the `nodes` list.
   - The example provides a plausible scenario, but you SHOULD adjust the thresholds and potentially the tree structure based on real medical data and expert knowledge. 

**Important:**

- This is still a simplified example. Real-world decision trees are often more complex. 
- You NEED a labeled dataset to determine appropriate thresholds and validate the tree's performance. 
- Consult with medical professionals for proper interpretation and application of such models.
