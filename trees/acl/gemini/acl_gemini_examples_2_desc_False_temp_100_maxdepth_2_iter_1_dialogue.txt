def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Using cartilage thickness as primary split
    nodes[1] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70  # Using Lysholm score as secondary split

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal if cartilage thickness is low
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal if Lysholm score is low
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal otherwise

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 0.8`:**  This threshold assumes that a baseline mean cartilage thickness below 0.8mm suggests a higher likelihood of abnormal change over the next 12 months. This is a hypothetical value and needs to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis.  A lower baseline thickness might already indicate cartilage damage.
* **`Lysholm <= 70`:** The Lysholm score is a patient-reported outcome measure for knee function.  A score below 70 is often associated with fair or poor knee function, which could correlate with a higher risk of abnormal cartilage changes.  Again, this is a reasonable starting point but should be validated with your data.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Threshold Optimization:**  The chosen thresholds are examples.  You *must* determine optimal thresholds using your data. Techniques like cross-validation and grid search can help find the best values.
* **Feature Importance:** The selected features (`ccmfthctabame` and `Lysholm`) are assumptions based on domain knowledge.  You should perform feature importance analysis on your dataset to confirm or identify better predictors.
* **Model Evaluation:**  After training the decision tree on your data, evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This will help assess its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.  You might need to adjust the `max_depth` or explore other features if the performance is not satisfactory.


This refined function adheres to the requested format, providing both the prediction and a list of truth values for the decision nodes. Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values derived from your data analysis. Using a decision tree library as demonstrated in the previous response is still the recommended approach for robust tree building and evaluation. This function provides a simplified representation for understanding the logic and structure of a decision tree.
