**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

The chosen features (BMI_FP, Age, and ccMF.S.T2.Me) are relevant to cartilage health and recovery after an ACL injury.

* **BMI_FP (Body Mass Index):** Higher BMI can be a risk factor for cartilage degeneration and may influence recovery.
* **Age:** Younger individuals often have better healing capabilities.
* **ccMF.S.T2.Me (T2 values for superficial cartilage):**  T2 values reflect the composition and health of cartilage. Changes in T2 values can indicate damage or degeneration, and superficial layers are particularly susceptible to changes after injury.

The tree structure is designed with plausible branching logic:

1. **BMI:** The tree first considers BMI as a broad indicator of risk.  Individuals with a lower BMI are generally expected to have better outcomes.
2. **Age:**  For those with normal or low BMI, age is considered as a secondary factor.  Younger individuals might heal more effectively.
3. **ccMF.S.T2.Me:**  The T2 value of the superficial cartilage layer is a more specific indicator of cartilage health.  Abnormal T2 values could suggest a higher risk of abnormal thickness change, even in individuals with healthy BMI and younger age.


**Important Notes:**

* This decision tree is generated without any training data. It's based on a hypothetical relationship between the chosen features and the target variable.  
* The performance of this tree on real data is unknown and likely to be suboptimal.  It's essential to train a decision tree on actual data to achieve reasonable accuracy.
* The depth of the tree is limited to 3, and the number of inner nodes is between 3 and 7 (in this case, exactly 3).
* The Python function adheres to the specified format, returning both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.



This approach provides a starting point for a decision tree model but highlights the importance of data-driven training for building effective classifiers.
