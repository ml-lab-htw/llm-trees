It's impossible to create a highly accurate decision tree without real data and training. However, I can provide a sample function based on your feature descriptions and some plausible decision thresholds. Keep in mind this is a **simplified example** and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.

```python
def predict_cartilage_change(X: dict):
    """Predicts cartilage thickness change based on patient features.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of patient features.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 0 for normal, 1 for abnormal change.
            nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Example rules - ADJUST THESE BASED ON MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] <= 30  # Younger patients might recover better
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # Surgical reconstruction might have better outcomes
    nodes[2] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] > 45  # Higher baseline T2 could indicate worse initial state
    nodes[3] = X["Lysholm"] < 70  # Lower Lysholm score suggests worse functional status
    nodes[4] = X["Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"] < -100  # Example biomechanical threshold

    if nodes[0]:  # Young patient
        if nodes[1]:  # Surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 0  # More likely normal change
        else:
            prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0  # Depends on baseline T2
    else:  # Older patient
        if nodes[3]:  # Low Lysholm score
            prediction = 1  # More likely abnormal change
        else:
            prediction = 1 if nodes[4] else 0  # Depends on knee moment

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (replace with actual patient data)
patient_data = {
    'Group': 1, 
    'Sex': 0, 
    'Height': 165, 
    'Body_Mass_FP': 60, 
    'BMI_FP': 22, 
    'Age': 25, 
    'Lysholm': 80, 
    'IKDC': 75, 
    'Tegner': 5, 
    'ccmfthctabame': 3.8, 
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 43, 
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 38, 
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 120, 
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -95, 
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 80, 
    'Dominant_Leg': 1, 
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 10
}

prediction, nodes = predict_cartilage_change(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {'Abnormal' if prediction == 1 else 'Normal'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** Takes a dictionary `X` containing patient features.
2. **Nodes Initialization:** Creates a list `nodes` to store truth values (True/False) for each decision node.
3. **Decision Rules:** Defines conditions based on feature thresholds. These are placeholders and should be **refined with domain expertise or model training**.
4. **Tree Logic:** The `if-else` structure represents the decision tree's branches, classifying the input based on the rules.
5. **Return Values:** Returns the predicted class (0 or 1) and the list of `nodes` indicating which branches were taken.

**To use this function effectively:**

* **Replace placeholder thresholds:**  Use medical knowledge or data analysis to determine appropriate cut-off values for each feature.
* **Train with real data:**  Once you have a labeled dataset, use a decision tree algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) to learn the best features and thresholds from the data. 

Remember: This is a simplified example. Real-world medical diagnosis requires rigorous model development and validation.
