**Key Improvements:**

* **Specific Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names you provided.
* **Meaningful Thresholds (Placeholder):** Includes example thresholds for `ccmfthctabame` and `Lysholm`.  These are placeholders and *must* be replaced with values determined from data analysis.  The chosen values reflect the medical intuition described previously.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The if/else structure is now more closely aligned with the decision tree logic.
* **Docstring:** Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose and arguments.
* **Example Usage:**  Added example code to demonstrate how to use the function.

**Crucial Next Step:**

The provided thresholds are just educated guesses. You **absolutely need to train a decision tree model on real data** to obtain accurate thresholds and potentially identify even more important features for prediction.  The structure of the function is now ready to accommodate the learned parameters once you have them.
