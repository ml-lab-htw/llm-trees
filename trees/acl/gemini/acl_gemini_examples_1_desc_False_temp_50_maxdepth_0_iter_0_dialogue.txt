**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds.  These *must* be replaced with values determined from actual data analysis.  You'd typically use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) to train a decision tree and find the optimal thresholds.
* **Simplified Logic:** I've simplified the decision tree logic to match the hypothetical tree structure provided earlier.  This makes the code clearer and easier to interpret.  The nested `if/else` structure directly reflects the branches of the tree.
* **Node Tracking:** The `nodes` list now accurately tracks the truth values of the conditions at each decision node. This is crucial for understanding the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.
* **Feature Usage:** The code now correctly uses the feature keys provided in your specifications.

**How to Use:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'Group': 2,
    'Sex': 0,
    'Height': 165,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 60,
    'BMI_FP': 22,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 80,
    'IKDC': 75,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': 1.7,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 42,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 30,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 100,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -50,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 75,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output will be 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output will be a list of booleans.
```

Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* example.  The accuracy and usefulness of this function depend entirely on having realistic thresholds derived from a dataset. Provide a dataset, and I can help you build a proper decision tree model.
