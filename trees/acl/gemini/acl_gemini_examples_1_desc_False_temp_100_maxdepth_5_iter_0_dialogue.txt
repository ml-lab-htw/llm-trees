**Explanation of Thresholds:**

* **`ccmfthctabame <= 1.5`**:  Assuming cartilage thickness is in mm, 1.5mm could be a reasonable threshold below which further thinning is considered abnormal.
* **`Lysholm <= 70`**: A Lysholm score below 70 is often associated with functional limitations, suggesting a higher likelihood of abnormal cartilage change.
* **`Age <= 30`**: Younger individuals generally have better cartilage healing potential.
* **`ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 45`**:  A T2 value of 45ms is a placeholder. Actual clinically relevant thresholds for deep cartilage T2 values would need to be determined from data.  Higher T2 values usually correspond to more cartilage degeneration.


This function now returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values at each inner node, as requested. Remember, these thresholds are hypothetical and should be determined from actual data in a real-world application.  Furthermore, this hardcoded decision tree is likely to be less accurate than a tree learned from data.  This example primarily focuses on the requested function structure and logical flow.
