**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` List:**  We initialize a list to store True/False for each decision node. This helps us track which branches were taken.
2. **Decision Nodes (Thresholds):**
   - `ccmfthctabame <= 1.8`: I've started with a cartilage thickness threshold. Values below this suggest a higher risk of abnormal change.
   - Other thresholds are placeholders. You'll need data exploration and potentially clinical input to determine more meaningful cutoffs.
3. **Decision Flow:** The `if/else` structure mirrors the tree logic:
    - If cartilage is thin (`nodes[0] is True`): We branch into age and Lysholm score considerations.
    - If cartilage is thicker: We check for surgical reconstruction and then biomechanical loading.
4. **Prediction:** At each leaf node, we assign either 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal) based on the combined decision path.

**Key Points:**

- **Placeholders:**  Remember that the thresholds I've used are illustrative! Real-world values should come from analyzing your data and domain expertise.
- **Feature Engineering:** You might find that combining features (e.g., creating a composite score) improves the tree's performance.
- **Model Iteration:** Building a decision tree is iterative. Expect to experiment with different thresholds, features, and tree depths to optimize its accuracy and clinical relevance.
