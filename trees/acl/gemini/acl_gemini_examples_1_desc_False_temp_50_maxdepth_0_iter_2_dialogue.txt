**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:**  I've added placeholder threshold values.  These are just educated guesses based on what might be biologically plausible.  You *must* replace these with values learned from your actual data when training a real decision tree model.
* **Correct Feature Names:** The code now uses the exact feature names you provided.
* **Simplified Structure:** The logic is more concise and reflects the decision tree structure described earlier.
* **Return Nodes:**  The function returns the `nodes` list indicating the truth values of each decision node, as requested.
* **Example Usage:**  The example demonstrates how to use the function with a sample feature dictionary.


**Crucial Reminder:** This is still a *demonstration*. The chosen thresholds and even the structure of the tree are based on assumptions. To create a useful model, you must train a decision tree algorithm on your actual data.  The example provides a template for how the function should be structured, but the internal logic will be different after training with a real dataset.
