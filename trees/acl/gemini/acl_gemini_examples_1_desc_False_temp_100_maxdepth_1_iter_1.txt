```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.95  # Using baseline cartilage thickness as a potential split point

    if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 0  # Predict normal cartilage change if baseline thickness is below the threshold
    else:
      prediction = 1  # Predict abnormal cartilage change if baseline thickness is above the threshold
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the generated decision tree:**

Since we are asked to create a decision tree of maximum depth 1 without training on data, we must make an educated guess about which feature and split point might be relevant for predicting cartilage thickness change. 

Given the features available, `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) seems intuitively related to potential changes in thickness.  A lower baseline thickness might be associated with less room for further decrease and thus a "normal" change. Conversely, a higher baseline thickness might suggest a greater potential for decrease and an "abnormal" change.

The split point of 1.95mm is arbitrary in this context (because we have no training data), but serves to illustrate how a decision tree would function.  In a real-world scenario, this split point would be determined by an algorithm optimizing for the best separation of classes based on the training data.

**Important considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This decision tree is not based on any data analysis. Its predictive performance is unknown and likely to be poor. It serves only as a demonstration of the requested format and basic decision tree logic.
* **Feature Selection:**  The choice of `ccmfthctabame` as the splitting feature is a hypothesis.  Other features, such as T2 values (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`, `ccMF.S.T2.Me`) or injury-related features (e.g., `Knee_Moment` features, `days_injury_to_MRI`), could also be relevant.  Proper feature selection requires data analysis and model training.
* **Split Point:** The split point of 1.95 is arbitrary.  A trained decision tree algorithm would determine the optimal split point based on the data.
* **Depth 1 Limitation:** A depth-1 decision tree is very limited in its ability to capture complex relationships in the data.  Deeper trees are generally more powerful but also prone to overfitting if not carefully controlled.
