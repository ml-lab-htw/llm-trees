```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.5  # Threshold: 1.5mm (hypothetical average healthy - some margin)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I'm using `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) as the sole feature, as justified in my previous response.

2. **Threshold:** I've set a hypothetical threshold of 1.5mm. This is based on the assumption that a baseline thickness significantly below the average healthy thickness (let's assume around 2mm for the sake of this example) would indicate a higher risk of abnormal change. This value is a placeholder and would need to be adjusted based on real-world data analysis.

3. **Depth 1:** The function directly checks the condition against the threshold and makes a prediction.  This adheres to the depth-1 constraint.

4. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth value (True/False) of the condition at the root node.  This is converted to 1/0 implicitly when used in a boolean context.

5. **Return Values:**  The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list, as required.

**Important Note:**  This function provides a *demonstration* of the format and logic.  The actual effectiveness depends entirely on the chosen feature and threshold, which must be determined through proper data analysis and model training.  Using this function on real data without training would likely yield poor results.
