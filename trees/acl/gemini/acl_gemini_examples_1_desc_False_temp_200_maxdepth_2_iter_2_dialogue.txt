def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Thresholds determined based on hypothetical relationships and reasonable values.
    # In a real application, these would be learned from data.
    T1 = 1.5  # Threshold for cartilage thickness (mm)
    L1 = 70  # Threshold for Lysholm score

    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= T1
    nodes[1] = X["Lysholm"] <= L1

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've assigned placeholder values `T1 = 1.5` and `L1 = 70`.  These would need to be determined from data analysis and model training in a real application.
* **Feature Usage:** The function now correctly uses `ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness) and `Lysholm` as specified.
* **Clarity:**  The code is structured to clearly reflect the decision tree logic.
* **Example Usage:**  The added example demonstrates how to use the function and interpret the output.
* **Return Values:**  The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list indicating which branches of the tree were taken.  This is useful for understanding the decision-making process.


To use this effectively, you would need to train a decision tree model on real data to learn the optimal thresholds (T1, L1) and potentially identify more important features.  This code provides the basic structure for making predictions once those parameters are determined.
