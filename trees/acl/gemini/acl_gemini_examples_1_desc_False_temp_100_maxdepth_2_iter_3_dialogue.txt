def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 0.8  # Threshold for baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # Surgical reconstruction group

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1 # Abnormal if baseline thickness is low
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Abnormal if surgical reconstruction
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Normal otherwise (simplified - could use Lysholm here for depth 2)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:**  Uses the exact feature names you provided (case-sensitive).
* **Threshold:** A threshold of 0.8mm is used for `ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness).  This is a hypothetical value â€“ a real model would learn this from data.  Cartilage this thin is likely already showing signs of damage.
* **Surgical Group:** The `Group` feature is used directly to check for surgical reconstruction (value 2).
* **Simplified Branching:**  The non-surgical branch is simplified.  A real model with depth 2 would likely use another feature here, such as `Lysholm` score, to further refine the prediction. A low Lysholm score might still indicate abnormal changes even if the baseline thickness is good and no surgery was performed.
* **Return Values:**  Returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values of the inner node conditions (True/False, represented as 1/0).


**To use this function:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'Group': 0,  # coper
    'Sex': 1, # Male
    'Height': 180,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 80,
    'BMI_FP': 24.7,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 85,
    'IKDC': 90,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': 1.2,  # Baseline cartilage thickness
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 45,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 30,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 120,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -80,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 50,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,  # Right
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

Remember, this function represents a *hypothetical* decision tree.  You *must* train a real model on actual data to get meaningful predictions. This example helps you structure your code and understand the logic.  Use scikit-learn with your dataset for a real-world solution.
