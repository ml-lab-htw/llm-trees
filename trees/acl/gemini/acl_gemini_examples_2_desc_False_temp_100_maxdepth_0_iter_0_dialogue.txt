**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** 
   - The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` containing patient features as input.

2. **Nodes Initialization:**
   - A list called `nodes` is created, initialized with `None` values. The length of this list corresponds to the number of inner nodes in your decision tree.

3. **Threshold Setting:**
   - The most crucial part is defining meaningful thresholds for each feature used in the decision nodes.  
   - **The provided thresholds are EXAMPLES ONLY and NOT clinically validated.**  You MUST replace them with thresholds determined from actual data analysis and medical expertise. 

4. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - The `if-else` statements represent the decision tree's branches, using the defined thresholds and feature values from the input `X`.
   - Each `if` condition corresponds to an inner node. When a condition is met, the corresponding entry in the `nodes` list is set to 1 (True); otherwise, it's 0 (False).

5. **Prediction:**
   - Based on the traversed path in the decision tree, a prediction of either 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal) is assigned.

6. **Return:**
   - The function returns a tuple containing the `prediction` and the `nodes` list, representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Remember:**  This code is a template.  You **must** replace the placeholder thresholds with values learned from your data through a proper machine learning process.  Additionally, the chosen features and tree structure are very simplified and likely insufficient for accurate medical diagnosis.
