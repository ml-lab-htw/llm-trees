This Python function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree structure from the previous response, using the specified feature names and reasonable threshold values. The `nodes` list tracks the truth value (1 or 0) of each decision node's condition, providing insights into the path taken through the tree for a given input `X`.  Remember, this is a demonstration and the accuracy on real data would depend on training a model with an appropriate dataset.
