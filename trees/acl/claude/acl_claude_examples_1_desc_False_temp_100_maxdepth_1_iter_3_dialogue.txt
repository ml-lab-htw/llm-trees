Based on the features provided and maintaining the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 using IKDC score as the primary split, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["IKDC"] <= 75.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If IKDC <= 75.0
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:  # If IKDC > 75.0
        prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (as we only have one split)
3. Evaluates if IKDC score is <= 75.0
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal)
   - nodes: list containing the boolean result of the IKDC comparison

The threshold of 75.0 for IKDC score is clinically meaningful as scores below this level typically indicate significant knee function impairment that might be associated with abnormal cartilage changes.
