Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier, here's the Python function that implements it, using the exact feature keys provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the decision node
3. Evaluates whether the external peak knee moment around z-axis is less than or equal to 0.45 Nm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node (True if â‰¤ 0.45 Nm, False otherwise)

The threshold of 0.45 Nm is based on biomechanical considerations for knee rotational loading that could affect cartilage health.
