Based on your decision tree and the provided feature keys, I'll create a Python function that implements the tree and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.4
    nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys as provided
2. Maintains the same tree structure as previously described
3. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
4. Returns a list of boolean values for each node condition

The thresholds were chosen based on typical values:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness is a reasonable threshold based on typical cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
- 0.4 Nm for the knee moment around the z-axis represents a moderate rotational load
- 30 days from injury to MRI represents the acute vs. chronic phase transition

The function evaluates three conditions:
1. Whether baseline cartilage thickness is ≤ 2.1 mm
2. Whether the peak knee moment around z-axis is ≤ 0.4 Nm
3. Whether the time from injury to MRI is ≤ 30 days

And classifies the cartilage thickness change as either normal (0) or abnormal (1) based on these conditions.
