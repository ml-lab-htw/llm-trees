Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and descriptions, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function as requested. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30
    nodes[2] = X["BMI_FP"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Group"] == 2  # surgical reconstruction
    nodes[4] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
    nodes[5] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 40
    nodes[6] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 30

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input. It then evaluates the conditions for each node in the decision tree and returns two things:

1. The prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The thresholds used in the function are based on the decision tree I created earlier, with some adjustments to match the provided feature descriptions and likely ranges. These thresholds should be considered approximate and would need to be fine-tuned based on actual data analysis.
