Based on the provided feature names and value ranges, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 65
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # external knee moment z-axis <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # Lysholm score <= 65
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds were chosen based on typical clinical values:
- 2.1 mm is a reasonable threshold for cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
- 0.35 Nm is a plausible value for peak external knee moment around the z-axis
- 65 points on the Lysholm score represents poor knee function (scale 0-100)

The function returns:
1. prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
2. nodes: list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0)
