Based on the provided feature names and encodings, here's the decision tree function that aligns with my previous tree structure and uses appropriate threshold values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z <= 0.45 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # surgical reconstruction group
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates three binary nodes based on clinically relevant thresholds
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node truth values
4. Uses the exact feature names as provided
5. Implements logical thresholds:
   - 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness (typical range: 1.5-3.0 mm)
   - 0.45 Nm for knee moment (typical range: 0.2-0.8 Nm)
   - Group comparison with surgical reconstruction (encoded as 2)
