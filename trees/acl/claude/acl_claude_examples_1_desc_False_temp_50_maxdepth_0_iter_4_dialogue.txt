Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts cartilage thickness change and returns the node conditions. I'll use clinically relevant thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1  # baseline cartilage thickness threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35  # external knee moment threshold
    nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30  # acute vs. chronic phase
    nodes[3] = X["IKDC"] <= 65  # functional status threshold
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # If knee moment <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # If baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # If days from injury <= 30
            if X["Group"] == 2:  # If surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # If coper/noncoper
                if nodes[3]:  # If IKDC <= 65
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # If days from injury > 30
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First evaluates baseline cartilage thickness as the primary predictor
2. Then considers biomechanical load (knee moment)
3. Takes into account the timing of assessment relative to injury
4. Considers treatment group and functional status (IKDC score)

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a typical threshold for
