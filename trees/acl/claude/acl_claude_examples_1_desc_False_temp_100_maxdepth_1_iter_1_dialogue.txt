Based on the provided feature names and descriptions, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the baseline mean cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame) as the primary decision feature, with a threshold of 2.3 mm which is within a realistic range for cartilage thickness in the central medial femur:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node since max_depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if cartilage thickness <= 2.3 mm
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:  # if cartilage thickness > 2.3 mm
        prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (since we only have one decision node)
3. Checks if the baseline cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.3 mm
4. Returns 1 (abnormal) if the thickness is â‰¤ 2.3 mm, and 0 (normal) if it's > 2.3 mm
5. Also returns the list of node conditions (truth values)
