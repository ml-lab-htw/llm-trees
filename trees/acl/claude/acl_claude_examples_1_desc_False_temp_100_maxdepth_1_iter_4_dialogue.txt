Based on the provided feature names and descriptions, I'll create a decision tree function using the external peak knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) as the primary splitting feature, with a clinically meaningful threshold of 0.4 Nm:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.4
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. Uses a single split (depth=1) based on the external peak knee moment around z-axis
2. Uses a threshold of 0.4 Nm, which is a reasonable value for rotational knee moments during walking
3. Returns both the prediction (0=normal, 1=abnormal) and the list of node conditions
4. Follows the specified format with a dictionary input for features
5. Uses the exact feature name as provided in the feature list

The logic is that higher rotational moments (>0.4 Nm) are more likely to lead to abnormal cartilage thickness changes over 12 months.
