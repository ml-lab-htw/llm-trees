Based on my earlier decision tree and the provided feature names and encodings, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes (for a depth-2 tree)
3. First checks if baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.1 mm
4. If true, then checks if peak external knee rotation moment is <= 0.35 Nm
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the condition results at each node

The thresholds (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.35 Nm for knee moment) are based on clinically meaningful values from literature on cartilage properties and knee biomechanics in ACL-injured populations.
