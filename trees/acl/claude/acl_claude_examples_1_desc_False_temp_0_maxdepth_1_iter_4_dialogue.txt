Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function using the external peak knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) as the primary splitting feature, with a meaningful threshold value.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the decision rule
3. Evaluates if the external peak knee moment around z-axis is less than or equal to 0.45 Nm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (normal) if the moment is â‰¤ 0.45 Nm, 1 (abnormal) if > 0.45 Nm
   - nodes: list containing the boolean result of the decision rule

The threshold of 0.45 Nm was chosen because:
1. It represents a clinically meaningful value for knee adduction moment
2. Values above this threshold have been associated with increased medial compartment loading
3. This increased loading could lead to abnormal cartilage adaptations
