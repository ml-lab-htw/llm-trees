Based on the provided feature descriptions and target variable encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, adjusting the thresholds to match the correct feature names and value ranges:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on Group (0=coper, 1=noncoper, 2=surgical)
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] <= 1
    
    # For coper/noncoper branch, check cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # For surgical branch, check external knee moment
    nodes[2] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    if nodes[0]:  # coper/noncoper
        if nodes[1]:  # thin cartilage
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # normal cartilage
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # surgical
        if nodes[2]:  # low knee moment
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # high knee moment
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
- Uses the correct feature names as provided
- Follows the encoding where 0 = normal, 1 = abnormal for the prediction
- Uses reasonable thresholds based on the features' expected ranges:
  * Group threshold of 1 separates copers/noncopers from surgical cases
  * Cartilage thickness threshold of 2.1 mm is within typical range
  * Knee moment threshold of 0.35 Nm is within typical range for ACL-injured patients
- Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions as required
