Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and requirements, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level split on baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second level splits
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # surgical reconstruction
    
    # Third level splits
    nodes[3] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30
    nodes[4] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
    
    if nodes[0]:  # cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment z > 0.35
            if nodes[2]:  # surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # coper/noncoper
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[3]:  # days to MRI <= 30
            if nodes[4]:  # Lysholm <= 70
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # Lysholm > 70
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # days to MRI > 30
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of node conditions
3. Evaluates 5 conditions using clinically relevant thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the exact feature names provided
6. Includes realistic threshold values based on clinical knowledge

The thresholds were chosen based on typical clinical values:
- 2.1 mm for cart
