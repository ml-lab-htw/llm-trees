Based on the provided feature keys and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts cartilage thickness change and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.0
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= -0.45
    nodes[2] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 45.0
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if X["Group"] == 2:  # surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # coper/noncoper
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame) with a threshold of 2.0 mm
2. External knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) with a threshold of -0.45 Nm
3. Superficial cartilage T2 values (ccMF.S.T2.Me) with a threshold of 45 ms
4. Group status (particularly identifying surgical reconstruction patients)

The function returns:
- prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
- nodes: list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds are based on typical values from ACL injury literature, where:
- 2.0 mm represents a typical baseline cartilage thickness
- -0.45 Nm represents a clinically relevant external knee moment
- 45 ms represents a typical T2 relaxation time for healthy cartilage
