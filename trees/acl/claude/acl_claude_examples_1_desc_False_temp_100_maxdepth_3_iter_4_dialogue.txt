Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the same structure as before but with proper feature names and realistic thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Implements the same tree structure as before
3. Uses realistic thresholds:
   - 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness is within typical range
   - 0.35 Nm for knee moment is a reasonable threshold
   - Group == 2 checks if the patient had surgical reconstruction
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the nodes list
5. Maintains the maximum depth of 3
