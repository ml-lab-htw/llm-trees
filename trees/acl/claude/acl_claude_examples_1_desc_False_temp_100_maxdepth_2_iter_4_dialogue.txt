Based on the provided feature names and value ranges, here's the decision tree function using the same structure I proposed but with the exact feature names and appropriate thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1

    if nodes[0]:  # Lower rotational knee moment
        if nodes[1]:  # Thinner baseline cartilage
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # Thicker baseline cartilage
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # Higher rotational knee moment
        if X["Group"] == 2:  # Surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # Coper or non-coper
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

The thresholds are based on biomechanical and anatomical considerations:
- 0.35 Nm for the rotational knee moment is a reasonable threshold based on typical gait analysis data
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness is within the normal range for femoral cartilage thickness

The function returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of boolean values for the inner nodes' conditions.
