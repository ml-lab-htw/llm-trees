Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for cartilage thickness change prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing decision path
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 45
    nodes[3] = X["IKDC"] <= 65

    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # External knee moment Z <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # Baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # Days from injury <= 45
            if nodes[3]:  # IKDC <= 65
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # Days from injury > 45
            if X["Group"] == 2:  # surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # coper/noncoper
                prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
3. Uses meaningful thresholds based on clinical relevance
4. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions
5. Incorporates the most important predictive features:
   - Baseline cartilage thickness
   - External knee moment around Z-axis
   - Days from injury to MRI
   - IKDC score
   - Treatment group

The thresholds were selected based on typical clinical values and the nature of the measurements. The tree structure
