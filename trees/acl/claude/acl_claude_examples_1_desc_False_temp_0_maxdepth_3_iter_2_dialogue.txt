Based on the provided features and target variable encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the most relevant features and meaningful thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second decision node: external knee moment around z-axis
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    # Third decision node: treatment group (surgical vs non-surgical)
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # If knee moment z <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If knee moment z > 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # If baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # If surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If coper/noncoper
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the baseline cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.1 mm (thin cartilage might be more susceptible to changes)
2. For thin cartilage, it then considers the external knee moment around the z-axis (rotational forces that might affect cartilage)
3. For thicker cartilage, it considers whether the patient underwent surgical reconstruction or not

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a relatively thin cartilage that might be more vulnerable to changes
- 0.35 Nm for the knee moment represents a moderate rotational load
- Group being 2 represents the surgical reconstruction group, which might have different outcomes compared to conservative treatment

The prediction returns:
