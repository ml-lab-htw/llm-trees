Based on the provided feature names and value ranges, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Maintains the target variable encoding (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
3. Uses realistic threshold values:
   - 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness is within typical range for knee cartilage
   - 0.45 Nm for knee moment around z-axis represents a reasonable threshold for rotational forces
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the state of each inner node
