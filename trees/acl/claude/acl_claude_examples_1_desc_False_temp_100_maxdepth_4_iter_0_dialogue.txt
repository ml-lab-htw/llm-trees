Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and requirements, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Node 1: Check external knee moment around z-axis
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    # Node 2: Check treatment group
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    # Node 3: Check T2 values in superficial layers
    nodes[3] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] > 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:  # Cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # Low knee moment
            if nodes[2]:  # Surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # Coper/noncoper
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # High knee moment
            if nodes[3]:  # High T2 values
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # Low T2 values
                prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes to store boolean values
3. Evaluates conditions at each node using clinically relevant thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the exact feature names provided
6. Uses reasonable threshold values based on the described ranges and clinical knowledge
