Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts cartilage thickness change and returns the node conditions. I'll use meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # surgical reconstruction
    nodes[3] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 45
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1mm
        if nodes[1]:  # low external knee moment
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # higher external knee moment
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1mm
        if nodes[2]:  # surgical reconstruction group
            if nodes[3]:  # early MRI assessment
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # later MRI assessment
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # coper/noncoper group
            if X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 45:  # T2 values for superficial layers
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions at each node using meaningful thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1mm for cartilage thickness represents a clinically meaningful threshold
- 0.35 Nm for knee moment represents a biomec
