Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature names you've given, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30
    nodes[2] = X["BMI_FP"] <= 25
    nodes[3] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    nodes[4] = X["Lysholm"] <= 80
    nodes[5] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 40

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input. It returns two things:
1. The prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal)
2. A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 if not, None if the node wasn't evaluated)

The decision tree uses the following features and thresholds:

1. Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (ccmfthctabame) <= 2.5 mm
2. Age <= 30 years
3. BMI (BMI_FP) <= 25 kg/m^2
4. Group (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
5.
