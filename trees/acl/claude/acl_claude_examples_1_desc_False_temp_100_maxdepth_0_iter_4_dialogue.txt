Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier, here's the Python function that implements it with specific thresholds and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.45
    nodes[1] = X["IKDC"] <= 65.5
    nodes[2] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 52.3
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= -0.45

    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.45
        if nodes[1]:  # IKDC <= 65.5
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # IKDC > 65.5
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.45
        if nodes[2]:  # T2 superficial <= 52.3
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # T2 superficial > 52.3
            if nodes[3]:  # knee moment z <= -0.45
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # knee moment z > -0.45
                prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes for the decision conditions
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the boolean results
4. Uses nested if-else statements to determine the prediction
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on typical values for these measurements:
- 2.45 mm for cartilage thickness is a reasonable threshold for distinguishing normal vs. thin cartilage
- 65.5 for IKDC represents a moderate level of knee function
- 52.3 ms for T2 values
