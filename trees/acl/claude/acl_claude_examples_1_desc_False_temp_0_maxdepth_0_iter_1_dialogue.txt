Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts cartilage thickness change (normal vs. abnormal) and returns the node conditions. I'll use clinically relevant thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] <= 0  # Is coper
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Baseline cartilage thickness threshold
    nodes[2] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.4  # External knee moment threshold
    nodes[3] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30  # Early vs. late baseline MRI
    nodes[4] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 35  # T2 values threshold for superficial layers

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Coper group
        if nodes[1]:  # Low baseline cartilage thickness
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:  # Normal baseline cartilage thickness
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:  # Non-coper or surgical reconstruction group
        if nodes[2]:  # Low external knee moment
            if nodes[3]:  # Early MRI
                prediction = 0  # Normal
            else:  # Late MRI
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:  # High external knee moment
            if nodes[4]:  # Low T2 values
                prediction = 0  # Normal
            else:  # High T2 values
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First splits on patient group (coper vs. others)
2. For copers, considers baseline cartilage thickness
3. For non-copers/surgical, considers:
   - External knee moment around z-axis
   - Time from injury to MRI
   - T2 values in superficial layers
