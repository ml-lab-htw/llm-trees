Based on the provided feature names and their descriptions, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses clinically relevant thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First split on group (surgical reconstruction vs others)
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] <= 1.5
    
    # Branch for surgical reconstruction and others
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[2] = X["IKDC"] <= 65.5
    
    # Branch for coper vs noncoper
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= -0.35
    nodes[4] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] > 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Group <= 1.5
        if nodes[1]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
            if nodes[2]:  # IKDC <= 65.5
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # IKDC > 65.5
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # Group > 1.5
        if nodes[3]:  # knee moment z <= -0.35
            if nodes[4]:  # T2 superficial > 45.0
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # T2 superficial <= 45.0
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # knee moment z > -0.35
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates each node condition using clinically meaningful thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the exact feature names as
