Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier, I'll create a Python function following the provided format. I'll use realistic threshold values based on clinical knowledge:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 35.5
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the three binary decisions (nodes)
3. First checks if baseline cartilage thickness is ≤ 2.1 mm
4. For thinner cartilage (≤ 2.1 mm), checks knee moment around z-axis
5. For thicker cartilage (> 2.1 mm), checks Lysholm score
6. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
   - nodes: list of three boolean values representing the outcome of each decision

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a typical threshold for distinguishing normal from thin cartilage
- 35.5 Nm for knee moment represents a moderate rotational load
- 70 for Lysholm score represents a moderate functional deficit
