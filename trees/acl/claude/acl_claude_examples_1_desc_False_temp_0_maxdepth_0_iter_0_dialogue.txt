Based on the provided feature keys and target encoding, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["IKDC"] <= 65
    nodes[3] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30
    
    # Tree traversal
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment z > 0.35
            if nodes[2]:  # IKDC <= 65
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # IKDC > 65
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[3]:  # days from injury <= 30
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # days from injury > 30
            if X["BMI_FP"] <= 25:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame)
2. Then considers external knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ)
3. Evaluates IKDC score
4. Considers time from injury to MRI
5. Finally checks BMI when relevant

The thresholds are set based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a typical threshold for normal thickness
- 0.35 Nm for knee moment is a biomechanically relevant threshold
- 65 for IKDC score represents moderate knee function
- 30 days represents the acute vs.
