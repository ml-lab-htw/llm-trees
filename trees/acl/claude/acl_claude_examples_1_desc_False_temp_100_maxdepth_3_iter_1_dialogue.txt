Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and expected format, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes for the three decision points
3. Evaluates conditions using the proper feature names and reasonable thresholds:
   - Baseline cartilage thickness threshold of 2.1 mm
   - External knee moment around z-axis threshold of 0.35 Nm
   - Group being surgical reconstruction (2) or not
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the exact feature names as provided in the list
6. Follows the proper encoding for the target variable (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
