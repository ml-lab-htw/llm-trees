Based on the biomechanical rationale and the provided feature names and value ranges, I'll create a decision tree function using the knee adduction moment (Z-axis) as the primary decision feature, with a clinically meaningful threshold:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 40.0  # threshold in Nm, typical for normal gait
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing all features
2. Creates a list to store the node conditions
3. Uses a threshold of 40.0 Nm for the knee adduction moment, which is a clinically relevant value
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The decision is based on whether the peak knee adduction moment during 0-50% of the gait cycle exceeds 40.0 Nm, which is a reasonable threshold based on biomechanical literature for identifying potentially harmful knee loading patterns.
