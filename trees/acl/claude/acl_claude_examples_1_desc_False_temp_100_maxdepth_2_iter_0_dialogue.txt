Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and target variable description, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45 if nodes[0] else X["Group"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment X <= 0.45 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment X > 0.45 Nm
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # Group == 2 (surgical reconstruction)
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # Group == 0 or 1 (coper/noncoper)
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions at each node using the same structure as the previous decision tree
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses realistic threshold values based on the feature descriptions and typical clinical values

The thresholds used (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.45 Nm for knee moment) are reasonable values based on biomechanical literature, though they could be adjusted based on specific clinical requirements.
