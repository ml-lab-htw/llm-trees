Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts cartilage thickness change and returns the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 45
    nodes[3] = X["Lysholm"] <= 75
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[2]:  # days from injury <= 45
            if X["Group"] == 2:  # surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # coper/noncoper
                if nodes[3]:  # Lysholm <= 75
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # days from injury > 45
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result (True=1, False=0)
4. Uses the tree structure to make a prediction (0=normal, 1=abnormal)
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a clinically meaningful threshold
- 0.35 Nm for knee moment represents a moderate load
- 45 days represents an early vs. late
