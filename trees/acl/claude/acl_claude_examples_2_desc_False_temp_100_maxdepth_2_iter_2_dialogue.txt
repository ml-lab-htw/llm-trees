Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier, here's the Python function formatted according to your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 65
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[2]:  # Lysholm <= 65
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes (for a depth-2 tree with 3 decision points)
3. Evaluates the conditions using the exact feature names provided
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds were chosen based on typical values:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness is around the typical thickness in the central medial femur
- 0.35 Nm for the knee moment represents a moderate loading threshold
- 65 for Lysholm score represents a poor functional outcome (as the score ranges from 0-100, with higher scores being better)
