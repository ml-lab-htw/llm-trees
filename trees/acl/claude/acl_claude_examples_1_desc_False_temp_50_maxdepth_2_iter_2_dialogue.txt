Based on the provided features and target variable encoding, here's the decision tree classifier implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z-axis <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment z-axis > 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if X["Group"] == 2:  # surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # coper or noncoper
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions for baseline cartilage thickness and knee moment
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node truth values

The thresholds were chosen based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a typical threshold for distinguishing between normal and potentially pathological cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
- 0.35 Nm for the external knee moment around the z-axis represents a biomechanically meaningful threshold for joint loading

The group classification (coper, noncoper, surgical reconstruction) uses the provided encoding (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction).
