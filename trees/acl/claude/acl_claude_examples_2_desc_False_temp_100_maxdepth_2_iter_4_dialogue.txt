Based on the provided decision tree and the exact feature names, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BMI_FP"] <= 25.5
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # BMI <= 25.5
        if nodes[1]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.3
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.3
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # BMI > 25.5
        prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names from the provided list
2. Maintains the same structure as the decision tree presented earlier
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
4. Uses meaningful threshold values:
   - BMI_FP threshold of 25.5 kg/mÂ² (boundary between normal weight and overweight)
   - ccmfthctabame (cartilage thickness) threshold of 2.3 mm (typical thickness in the central medial femur)
5. Follows the target encoding where 0 = normal and 1 = abnormal cartilage thickness change

The nodes list will contain two boolean values:
- nodes[0]: True if BMI_FP <= 25.5, False otherwise
- nodes[1]: True if ccmfthctabame <= 2.3, False otherwise
