Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses meaningful thresholds and returns both the prediction and the node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1  # baseline cartilage thickness threshold
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35  # external knee moment z-axis threshold
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # surgical reconstruction group
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # if cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # if knee moment z <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # if knee moment z > 0.35
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # if cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[2]:  # if surgical reconstruction group
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # if coper/noncoper group
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the baseline cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.1 mm
2. For thin cartilage (â‰¤2.1 mm), it then checks the external knee moment around the z-axis
3. For thicker cartilage (>2.1 mm), it checks if the patient is in the surgical reconstruction group

The predictions are:
- 0 = normal cartilage thickness change
- 1 = abnormal cartilage thickness change

The thresholds are based on biomechanical principles and clinical knowledge:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a clinically relevant threshold
- 0.35 Nm for knee moment represents a moderate loading threshold
- Group == 2 identifies surgical reconstruction patients who might be at higher risk of abnormal changes
