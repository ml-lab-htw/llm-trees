Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether cartilage thickness change is normal (0) or abnormal (1). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with meaningful thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["IKDC"] <= 65
    nodes[2] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 45
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= -0.4

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # IKDC <= 65
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # T2 superficial <= 45 ms
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # knee moment z <= -0.4 Nm
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses four key features:
1. Baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame)
2. IKDC score (IKDC)
3. T2 values in superficial layers (ccMF.S.T2.Me)
4. External knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ)

The thresholds were chosen based on typical values:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a clinically relevant threshold
- IKDC score of 65 represents moderate knee function
- T2 value of 45 ms is a typical threshold for cartilage quality
- -0.4 Nm for knee moment represents a biomechanically relevant threshold
