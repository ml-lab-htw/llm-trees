Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided feature keys and target variable encoding, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 0  # coper
    nodes[3] = X["IKDC"] <= 70
    nodes[4] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 60

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # normal
        elif X["Group"] == 1:  # noncoper
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # surgical reconstruction
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
2. It evaluates the conditions for each node based on the feature values in the input dictionary `X`.
3. It then uses these conditions to navigate through the decision tree and make a prediction.
4. The prediction is encoded as 0 for normal and 1 for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
5. The function returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds used in this function are:
- 2.5 mm for baseline mean cartilage thickness
- 30 years for age
- 70 for IKDC score
- 60 days from injury to MRI

These thresholds are estimates based on typical values and would need to be adjusted based on actual data and clinical expertise.

The group encoding (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction) is use
