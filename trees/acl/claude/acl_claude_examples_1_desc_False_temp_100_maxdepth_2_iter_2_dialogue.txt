Based on the provided feature names, encodings, and expected output format, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45 if nodes[0] else X["Group"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment X <= 0.45 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment X > 0.45 Nm
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # surgical reconstruction group
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # coper/noncoper group
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions using the proper feature names and realistic thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node truth values
5. Uses the same tree structure as previously defined, but with the exact feature names from the provided list

The thresholds used (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.45 Nm for knee moment) are set to realistic values based on typical ranges for these measurements in ACL injury patients.
