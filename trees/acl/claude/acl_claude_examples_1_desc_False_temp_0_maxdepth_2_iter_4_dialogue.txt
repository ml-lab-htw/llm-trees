Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second split: either external knee moment or group depending on first split
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    # Determine prediction based on decision path
    if nodes[0]:  # cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment > 0.35
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # coper/noncoper
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
3. Uses meaningful thresholds:
   - 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame)
   - 0.35 Nm for external knee moment (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ)
   - Group encoding of 2 for surgical reconstruction
4. Returns both the prediction and the node conditions as required

The thresholds were chosen based on biomechanical relevance:
- 2.1 mm represents a typical threshold for distinguishing between normal and thin cartilage in the central medial femur
- 0.35 Nm represents a clinically meaningful threshold for external knee moment that might influence cartilage adaptation
-
