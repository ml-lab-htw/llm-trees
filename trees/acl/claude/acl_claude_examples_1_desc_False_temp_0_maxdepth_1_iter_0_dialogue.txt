Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function using the external peak knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) as the primary splitting feature. I'll use a threshold of 0.45 Nm as discussed earlier.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth value of the decision node
3. Evaluates if the knee moment around z-axis is <= 0.45 Nm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 (normal) if knee moment â‰¤ 0.45 Nm, 1 (abnormal) if > 0.45 Nm
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The prediction logic follows the biomechanical principle that higher knee adduction moments (z-axis moment) are associated with greater medial compartment loading, which could lead to abnormal cartilage thickness changes.
