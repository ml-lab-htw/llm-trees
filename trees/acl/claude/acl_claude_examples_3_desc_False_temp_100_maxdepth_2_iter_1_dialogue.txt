Based on the decision tree I created earlier, here's the Python function that implements it:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment z <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment z > 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 2 nodes (for a depth-2 tree)
2. First node checks if baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.1 mm
3. Second node checks if external peak knee moment around z-axis is <= 0.35 Nm
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.35 Nm for knee moment) are based on clinically meaningful values:
- 2.1 mm represents a relatively thin cartilage thickness that might indicate increased risk
- 0.35 Nm represents a relatively low rotational moment that might indicate altered biomechanics

The function uses the exact feature names from the provided list and maintains the specified target encoding (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal).
