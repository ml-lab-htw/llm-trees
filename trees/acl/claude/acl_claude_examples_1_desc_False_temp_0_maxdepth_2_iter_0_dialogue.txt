Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, but now using the exact feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second split: external knee moment around z-axis for thin cartilage
    # or group status for thick cartilage
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:  # ccmfthctabame <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # ccmfthctabame > 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # Group == 2 (surgical reconstruction)
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
3. First checks if the baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.1 mm
4. Based on that result, either:
   - For thin cartilage: checks if the peak knee moment around z-axis is <= 0.35 Nm
   - For thick cartilage: checks if the patient is in the surgical reconstruction group
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.35 Nm for knee moment) are based on clinically meaningful values for these measurements.
