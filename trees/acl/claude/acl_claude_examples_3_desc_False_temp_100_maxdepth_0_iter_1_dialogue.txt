Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and target variable encoding, here's the Python function that predicts cartilage thickness change and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
    nodes[3] = X["Age"] <= 30
    nodes[4] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 45
    nodes[5] = X["BMI_FP"] <= 25

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values as input. It then evaluates the conditions at each node of the decision tree and returns two things:

1. The prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
2. A list of the truth values of the inner nodes, where 1 indicates the condition was met, 0 indicates it wasn't met, and None indicates the node wasn't evaluated.

The thresholds used in the decision tree are based on reasonable estimates for the features:

- Baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame) of 2.5 mm
- Lysholm score of 70 (often used as a cutoff for poor vs. good knee function)
- Age of
