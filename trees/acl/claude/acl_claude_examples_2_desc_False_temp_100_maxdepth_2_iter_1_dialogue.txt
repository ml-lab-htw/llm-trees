Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier and the exact feature names provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.3
    
    # Second decision node: knee moment around z-axis or group
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.4 if nodes[0] else X["Group"] == 2
    
    # Make prediction based on decision path
    if nodes[0]:  # If baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.3
        if nodes[1]:  # If knee moment <= 0.4
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If knee moment > 0.4
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # If baseline cartilage thickness > 2.3
        if nodes[1]:  # If surgical reconstruction (Group == 2)
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If coper/noncoper (Group == 0 or 1)
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
3. Evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - First node checks if baseline cartilage thickness is ≤ 2.3 mm
   - Second node checks either:
     - If knee moment ≤ 0.4 Nm (when first condition is true)
     - Or if patient is in surgical reconstruction group (when first condition is false)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for normal, 1 for abnormal cartilage thickness change
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds (2.3 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.4 Nm for knee moment) are based on clinical relevance and typical values in ACL
