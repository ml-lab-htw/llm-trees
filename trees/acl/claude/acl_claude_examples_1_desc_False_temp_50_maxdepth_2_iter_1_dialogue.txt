Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second split depends on first condition
    if nodes[0]:
        # If thickness is low, check knee moment
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    else:
        # If thickness is high, check group
        nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:  # thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # moment <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # moment > 0.35
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # coper/noncoper
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
3. First checks if the baseline cartilage thickness is ≤ 2.1 mm
4. Based on that result, either:
   - Checks if the peak knee moment around z-axis is ≤ 0.35 Nm (if thickness is low)
   - Checks if the patient is in the surgical reconstruction group (if thickness is high)
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (2.1 mm for thickness and 0.35 Nm for moment) are based on typical values from biomechanical literature, though they should ideally be optimized using training data.
