Based on the provided feature names and value ranges, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: IKDC score threshold
    nodes[0] = X["IKDC"] <= 75.5
    
    # Second level: T2 values and group split
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] > 52.3
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # surgical reconstruction
    
    # Third level: biomechanical and temporal factors
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= -0.42
    nodes[4] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.85
    
    if nodes[0]:  # IKDC <= 75.5
        if nodes[1]:  # High T2 values
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # Lower T2 values
            if nodes[3]:  # Low knee moment
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # IKDC > 75.5
        if nodes[2]:  # surgical reconstruction
            if nodes[4]:  # thin cartilage
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
        else:  # coper/noncoper
            if X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of each decision node
3. Evaluates each condition and stores the result
4. Uses these conditions to navigate through the tree
5. Returns both the final prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are set based on clinical relevance:
- IKDC score of
