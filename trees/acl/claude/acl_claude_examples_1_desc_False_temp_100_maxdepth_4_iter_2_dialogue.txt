Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    nodes[2] = X["IKDC"] <= 65
    nodes[3] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.1 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment x <= 0.35 Nm
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment x > 0.35 Nm
            if nodes[2]:  # IKDC <= 65
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:  # IKDC > 65
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.1 mm
        if X["Group"] == 2:  # surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # coper or noncoper
            if nodes[3]:  # days from injury <= 45
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:  # days from injury > 45
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
3. Uses threshold values that are clinically meaningful:
   - 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness
   - 0.35 Nm for knee moment
   - 65 for IKDC score (0-100 scale)
   - 45 days for time from injury to MRI
4. Uses the correct encoding for the Group variable (2 = surgical reconstruction)
