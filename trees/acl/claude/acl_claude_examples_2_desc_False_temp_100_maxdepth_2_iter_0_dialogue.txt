Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys, I'll create a Python function that implements the tree and returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.3
    
    # Left branch split on knee moment around z-axis
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.4
    
    # Right branch split on days from injury to MRI
    nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If cartilage thickness <= 2.3
        if nodes[1]:  # If knee moment <= 0.4
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If knee moment > 0.4
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # If cartilage thickness > 2.3
        if nodes[2]:  # If days <= 30
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If days > 30
            prediction = 0  # normal
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature keys provided
2. Has meaningful thresholds based on clinical relevance:
   - 2.3 mm for cartilage thickness represents a clinically relevant threshold
   - 0.4 Nm for knee moment represents a biomechanically relevant threshold
   - 30 days represents a common clinical timeline for early vs. delayed assessment
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and a list of three boolean values representing the conditions at each node
4. Has a maximum depth of 2 as requested
5. Uses the specified target encoding (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
