Based on my earlier decision tree, I'll create a Python function that implements it, using the exact feature names you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    nodes[1] = X["IKDC"] <= 65
    nodes[2] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.4
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the boolean results of each condition
3. Evaluates three key features:
   - Baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame)
   - IKDC score
   - External peak knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for normal, 1 for abnormal cartilage thickness change
   - nodes: list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met

The thresholds were chosen based on clinical relevance:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness represents a typical threshold for normal thickness
- 65 for IKDC score represents a moderate functional deficit
- 0.4 Nm for knee moment represents a conservative threshold for mechanical loading
