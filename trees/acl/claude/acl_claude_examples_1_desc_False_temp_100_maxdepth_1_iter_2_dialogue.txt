Based on the features provided and their descriptions, I'll create a prediction function using the external peak knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) as the primary splitting criterion. I'll use a threshold that makes biomechanical sense:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45  # threshold in Nm
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list for storing the node conditions (only one node for depth=1)
3. Evaluates whether the external peak knee moment around z-axis is <= 0.45 Nm
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the condition

The threshold of 0.45 Nm for the rotational moment is chosen based on biomechanical considerations, where higher rotational moments might indicate increased risk for cartilage degradation.
