Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: baseline cartilage thickness threshold
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second node: external knee moment around z-axis threshold for thin cartilage
    # or group check for thick cartilage
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # checking if surgical reconstruction
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
3. First checks if baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.1 mm
4. Based on that result:
   - If thickness is low (≤2.1 mm), checks if external knee moment around z-axis is ≤0.35 Nm
   - If thickness is high (>2.1 mm), checks if the patient is in the surgical reconstruction group (Group == 2)
5. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.35 Nm for knee moment) are based on biomechanical relevance and typical values from literature.
