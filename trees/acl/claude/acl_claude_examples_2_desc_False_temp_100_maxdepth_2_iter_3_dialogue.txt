Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a Python function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, with adjusted feature names and appropriate thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.3
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 40.5 if nodes[0] else X["Group"] == 2

    if nodes[0]:  # baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.3
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment X <= 40.5
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment X > 40.5
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # baseline cartilage thickness > 2.3
        if nodes[1]:  # Group == 2 (surgical reconstruction)
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # Group == 0 or 1 (coper/noncoper)
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two inner nodes
3. First node checks if baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.3 mm
4. Second node checks either:
   - If knee moment X <= 40.5 Nm (when thickness <= 2.3)
   - If Group == 2 (surgical reconstruction) (when thickness > 2.3)
5. Returns:
   - prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)
   - list of node conditions (True/False)

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance and typical values in ACL injury literature.
