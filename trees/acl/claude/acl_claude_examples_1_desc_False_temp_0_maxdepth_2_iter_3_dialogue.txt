Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second split: either knee moment or group depending on first split
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction
    
    # Determine prediction based on decision path
    if nodes[0]:  # cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # knee moment <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # knee moment > 0.35
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # coper/noncoper
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the binary results of the decision nodes
3. First checks if baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.1 mm
4. Based on that result, either:
   - Checks if the external knee moment around z-axis is <= 0.35 Nm, or
   - Checks if the patient is in the surgical reconstruction group
5. Returns both the final prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node results

The thresholds (2.1 mm for cartilage thickness and 0.35 Nm for knee moment) are based on biomechanical relevance and typical values from the literature.
