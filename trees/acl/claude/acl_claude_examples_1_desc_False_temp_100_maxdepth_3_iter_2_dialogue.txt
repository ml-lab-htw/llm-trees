Based on the provided feature names and value ranges, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for 3 internal nodes
    
    # First split based on baseline cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    # Second split based on knee rotational moment
    nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.35
    
    # Third split based on treatment group
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # 2 represents surgical reconstruction
    
    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If cartilage thickness <= 2.1
        if nodes[1]:  # If knee moment <= 0.35
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If knee moment > 0.35
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # If cartilage thickness > 2.1
        if nodes[2]:  # If surgical reconstruction
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # If coper/noncoper
            prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the binary decisions
3. Uses realistic threshold values based on the feature descriptions
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and the list of node decisions
5. Uses the exact feature names as provided
6. Implements the same tree structure as previously described, but with proper feature names and encodings

The thresholds chosen are:
- 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness (typical range for knee cartilage)
- 0.35 Nm for knee rotational moment (reasonable value for walking)
- Group == 2 for surgical reconstruction (matching the provided encoding)
