Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the knee moment around the z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) and baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame) as the main predictors. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.45
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
2. First node checks if the peak knee moment around z-axis is <= 0.45 Nm
3. Second node checks if the baseline cartilage thickness is <= 2.1 mm
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds (0.45 Nm for knee moment and 2.1 mm for cartilage thickness) are based on biomechanical understanding:
- A rotational moment > 0.45 Nm represents increased mechanical load that might lead to abnormal cartilage changes
- A baseline cartilage thickness â‰¤ 2.1 mm might indicate pre-existing cartilage issues that could predispose to abnormal changes
