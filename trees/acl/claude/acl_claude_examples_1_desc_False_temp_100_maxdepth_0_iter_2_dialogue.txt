Based on the provided features and target variable encoding, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [
        X["Height"] <= 172.5,
        X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 0.29,
        X["Height"] <= 184.5
    ]

    prediction = 1 if nodes[0] and nodes[1] else 0

    return prediction, nodes

```

This decision tree uses:
1. Baseline cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame) with threshold 2.1 mm
2. External knee moment around z-axis (Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ) with threshold 0.35 Nm
3. Treatment group (Group), specifically checking for surgical reconstruction (value 2)
4. T2 values for superficial layers (ccMF.S.T2.Me) with threshold 45.0 ms

The function returns:
- prediction: 0 for normal cartilage thickness change, 1 for abnormal
- nodes: list of boolean values indicating whether each condition was met

The thresholds were selected based on typical clinical values and biomechanical considerations for cartilage health and knee function.
