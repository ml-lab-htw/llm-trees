**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds (0.8 and 0.6) for the `ccmfthctabame` feature. These are hypothetical and should be determined from data analysis.  It's reasonable to assume that surgically reconstructed knees might tolerate slightly lower cartilage thickness.
* **Group Handling:** The code now correctly handles the three groups (coper, noncoper, surgical reconstruction) as specified in the prompt.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list is populated with boolean values (True/False), representing whether each node's condition is met.  These are coerced to 1/0 when printed.
* **Example Usage:**  I've included an example demonstrating how to use the `predict` function with a dictionary of feature values.



**Critical Note:** This function represents a highly simplified decision tree based on assumptions about feature importance and threshold values.  It's crucial to remember that a real-world model requires proper data, training, and evaluation. This is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for clinical decision-making.
