Sure! Based on the provided information, here's the Python function that represents the decision tree. It returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the Group is 'surgical reconstruction' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = X['Group'] == 2  # 2 = surgical reconstruction

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `'Group'` (with exact spelling as provided).
  
- **Encoding:**
  - `0` = coper
  - `1` = noncoper
  - `2` = surgical reconstruction

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **Node 0:** Check if the patient underwent **surgical reconstruction** (i.e., `Group == 2`).
    - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = True`), predict **abnormal** cartilage thickness change (`prediction = 1`).
    - If **no** (`nodes[0] = False`), predict **normal** cartilage thickness change (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
patient_data = {
    'Group': 2,
    'Sex': 1,
    'Height': 175,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 70,
    'BMI_FP': 22.9,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 85,
    'IKDC': 90,
    'Tegner': 6,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.5,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 35,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 40,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 10,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -5,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 15,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (abnormal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True]
```

**Notes:**

- The `nodes` list has one element corresponding to the root node (Node 0).
  - `nodes[0] = 1` if the condition `X['Group'] == 2` is **True**.
  - `nodes[0] = 0` if the condition is **False**.

- The function strictly adheres to the exact feature names and encodings provided.

**Thresholds and Placeholders:**

- Since the decision tree uses a categorical feature `'Group'` with specific encodings, there are no numerical thresholds to fill in.
- The condition `X['Group'] == 2` is based on the meaningful value that corresponds to **surgical reconstruction**.

Feel free to use this function in your code. If you have more data or wish to consider other features with thresholds, please provide additional information, and I can adjust the decision tree accordingly.
