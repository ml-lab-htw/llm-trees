Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features, and returns a single prediction (`0` for normal cartilage thickness change, `1` for abnormal) along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the Group is 'coper' (0)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Group'] == 0)
    
    # Node 1: Check if the baseline mean T2 value for the deep cartilage layers is <= 40.0 ms
    nodes[1] = int(X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] <= 40.0)

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `Group`: Represents the group category (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction).
  - `ccMF.D.T2.Me`: Baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates to `1` if `Group` is `0` (coper), else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates to `1` if `ccMF.D.T2.Me` is less than or equal to `40.0`, else `0`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (the individual is a coper), the prediction is `0` (normal cartilage thickness change).
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (noncoper or surgical reconstruction):
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1` (`ccMF.D.T2.Me` â‰¤ 40.0 ms), prediction is `0` (normal).
    - If `nodes[1]` is `0` (`ccMF.D.T2.Me` > 40.0 ms), prediction is `1` (abnormal).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input features for an individual:

```python
X_sample = {
    'Group': 1,  # noncoper
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 42.5,
    # ... other features
}
```

We can predict the cartilage thickness change and get the truth values of the nodes:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Abnormal cartilage thickness change)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0]
```

**Note:** The function strictly uses the keys provided, ensuring that the feature names match exactly as specified, and follows the encoding and thresholds as per your instructions.

**Additional Information:**

- **Thresholds Used:**
  - For `ccMF.D.T2.Me`: The threshold value is set at `40.0` ms, which is a meaningful value indicating potential degenerative changes in cartilage if exceeded.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `x1`: Cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (`0` = normal, `1` = abnormal).
