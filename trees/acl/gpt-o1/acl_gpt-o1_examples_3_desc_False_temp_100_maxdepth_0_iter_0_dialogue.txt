Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function, following the structure and format of the examples you provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the exact feature keys you've specified and returns a prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 6  # Initialize a list to store truth values for 6 nodes

    # Node 0: Is Group == 2 (surgical reconstruction)?
    nodes[0] = int(X['Group'] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Left branch for Group == 2
        # Node 1: Is days_injury_to_MRI <= 21?
        nodes[1] = int(X['days_injury_to_MRI'] <= 21)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 40?
            nodes[2] = int(X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] <= 40)
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Normal (x1 = 0)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal (x1 = 1)
        else:
            nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 not evaluated
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal (x1 = 1)
        nodes[3] = None  # Nodes 3, 4, 5 not evaluated in this branch
        nodes[4] = None
        nodes[5] = None
    else:
        # Right branch for Group != 2 (Group = 0 or 1)
        nodes[1] = None  # Nodes 1 and 2 not evaluated in this branch
        nodes[2] = None
        # Node 3: Is IKDC <= 75?
        nodes[3] = int(X['IKDC'] <= 75)
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Is Lysholm <= 70?
            nodes[4] = int(X['Lysholm'] <= 70)
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal (x1 = 1)
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal (x1 = 0)
            nodes[5] = None  # Node 5 not evaluated in this path
        else:
            nodes[4] = None  # Node 4 not evaluated
            # Node 5: Is ccmfthctabame <= 2.3?
            nodes[5] = int(X['ccmfthctabame'] <= 2.3)
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal (x1 = 1)
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal (x1 = 0)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation of the Function**

- **Inputs**:
  - `X`: A dictionary containing feature values with the exact keys you've specified.
- **Outputs**:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (1 for True, 0 for False, `None` if not evaluated) corresponding to the inner nodes.

### **Nodes in the Decision Tree**

- `nodes[0]`: Checks if `Group` is surgical reconstruction (`Group == 2`).
- `nodes[1]`: If `Group == 2`, checks if `days_injury_to_MRI <= 21`.
- `nodes[2]`: If `days_injury_to_MRI <= 21`, checks if `ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 40`.
- `nodes[3]`: If `Group != 2`, checks if `IKDC <= 75`.
- `nodes[4]`: If `IKDC <= 75`, checks if `Lysholm <= 70`.
- `nodes[5]`: If `IKDC > 75`, checks if `ccmfthctabame <= 2.3`.

### **Feature Keys and Descriptions**

- **Group**: Treatment group (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
- **Sex**: Sex (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **Height**: Height in centimeters (cm)
- **Body_Mass_FP**: Body mass in kilograms (kg)
- **BMI_FP**: Body mass index (kg/mÂ²)
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Lysholm**: Lysholm knee score
- **IKDC**: International Knee Documentation Committee score
- **Tegner**: Tegner activity level score
- **ccmfthctabame**: Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (mm)
- **ccMF.D.T2.Me**: Baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms)
- **ccMF.S.T2.Me**: Baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms)
- **Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ**: External peak knee moment around x-axis (Nm)
- **Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ**: External peak knee moment around y-axis (Nm)
- **Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ**: External peak knee moment around z-axis (Nm)
- **Dominant_Leg**: Dominant leg (0 = left, 1 = right)
- **days_injury_to_MRI**: Days from injury to baseline MRI

### **Example Usage**

Here's how you might use the `predict` function with an example input:

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    'Group': 2,
    'Sex': 1,
    'Height': 180,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 75,
    'BMI_FP': 23.1,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 85,
    'IKDC': 80,
    'Tegner': 6,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.5,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 38,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 35,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 40,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -20,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 10,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 15
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the result
print(f"Prediction (x1): {prediction} ({'Normal' if prediction == 0 else 'Abnormal'})")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

### **Sample Output**

```
Prediction (x1): 0 (Normal)
Nodes truth values: [1, 1, 1, None, None, None]
```

### **Understanding the Output**

- The `nodes` list indicates which conditions were evaluated and their outcomes:
  - `1` means the condition was **True**.
  - `0` means the condition was **False**.
  - `None` means the condition was not evaluated in that path.
- In the sample output:
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: The patient is in the surgical reconstruction group (`Group == 2`).
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: Days from injury to MRI is less than or equal to 21 (`days_injury_to_MRI <= 21`).
  - `nodes[2] = 1`: Baseline T2 value (deep layer) is less than or equal to 40 ms (`ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 40`).
  - Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are `None` because they were not evaluated in this path.

### **Threshold Values**

The thresholds used in the decision tree are based on meaningful and clinically relevant values:

- **Group == 2**: Identifies patients who underwent surgical reconstruction.
- **days_injury_to_MRI <= 21**: Early assessment within 3 weeks of injury.
- **ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 40**: T2 relaxation times indicative of normal cartilage composition.
- **IKDC <= 75**: IKDC scores less than or equal to 75 suggest lower knee function.
- **Lysholm <= 70**: Lysholm scores less than or equal to 70 indicate significant impairment.
- **ccmfthctabame <= 2.3**: Baseline cartilage thickness below 2.3 mm may be considered thin and at risk.

### **Notes**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with accurate data.
- All numerical comparisons are performed as per the thresholds specified.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic provided.
