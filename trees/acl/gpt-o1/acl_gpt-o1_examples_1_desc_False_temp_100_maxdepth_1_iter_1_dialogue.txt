**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Group"] == 0)  # Check if the Group is 'Coper' (0)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

This function predicts whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is normal (`0`) or abnormal (`1`), based on the patient's **Group** status.

- **Feature Encoding:**
  - `Group`: 
    - `0` = Coper
    - `1` = Noncoper
    - `2` = Surgical Reconstruction

**Logic:**

- **Node Condition (nodes[0]):** 
  - We check if the patient is a **Coper** by evaluating `X["Group"] == 0`.
  - The expression `int(X["Group"] == 0)` will be `1` if the condition is `True` (the patient is a Coper) and `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (the patient is a Coper), **then** `prediction` is `0` (normal cartilage thickness change).
  - **Else** (the patient is a Noncoper or has had Surgical Reconstruction), **then** `prediction` is `1` (abnormal cartilage thickness change).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'Group': 0,  # Coper
    # Other features are not used in this tree
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")   # Output: Node conditions: [1]
```

**Alternative Representation (Using a Threshold):**

If we prefer to represent the decision condition using a threshold (to mirror the example format), we can adjust the function slightly:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] <= 0.5  # Group codes: Coper=0, Noncoper=1, Surgical Reconstruction=2

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Note on Threshold:**

- The condition `X["Group"] <= 0.5` effectively checks if `Group` is `0` (Coper), since `Group` is an integer and `0 <= 0.5` is `True`, while `1` and `2` are greater than `0.5`.

**Final Remarks:**

- The decision tree has a **maximum depth of 1**, with a single decision node based on the **Group** feature.
- The tree leverages the most significant feature influencing the outcome, which is whether the patient is a **Coper**.
- The `nodes` list provides a trace of the decision path:
  - `1` indicates the condition at the node was satisfied.
  - `0` indicates it was not satisfied.

This function format adheres to your specifications, mirroring the example provided, and includes meaningful thresholds and feature encodings.
