**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1. **Threshold:** The threshold of 0.8 mm for `ccmfthctabame` is a placeholder.  You **must** determine an appropriate threshold based on analysis of your training data.  This is crucial for the tree to make meaningful predictions.
2. **Feature Importance:** I've used `ccmfthctabame` and `Group` based on the earlier discussion.  However, the actual most important features need to be determined through proper feature importance analysis on your dataset.
3. **Depth 2:** The code strictly adheres to the depth-2 requirement.
4. **Node List:** The `nodes` list provides the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the conditions at each inner node, as requested.
5. **Example Usage:** The provided example demonstrates how to use the function.  Make sure to replace the example feature values with your own data.
6. **Training Data:** I cannot emphasize enough the importance of using real training data to build a useful model. This hypothetical tree is for illustrative purposes only.  You need to train a decision tree classifier on your data to obtain a model that generalizes well.


Remember to use appropriate tools like scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` to train your model on your data.  This will automatically determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure.  The code provided here is a simplified representation for understanding the basic logic and fulfilling the specific format requirements of your prompt.
