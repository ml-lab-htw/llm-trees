```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds of 1.6mm and 1.8mm for `ccmfthctabame` are still somewhat arbitrary, but now they are different based on the `Group`. We assume slightly thicker cartilage might be sufficient for a "normal" outcome in the coper/noncoper groups compared to the surgical reconstruction group.  Ideally, these thresholds would be learned from training data.
* **Surgical Reconstruction as Primary Split:** This tree prioritizes surgical reconstruction as the most important feature. This aligns with the clinical intuition that surgical intervention plays a significant role in cartilage health outcomes.
* **Cartilage Thickness as Secondary Split:** Baseline cartilage thickness is used as the secondary splitting criterion, reflecting its importance in predicting future cartilage health.



**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'Group': 2,  # Surgical reconstruction
    'Sex': 0,
    'Height': 170,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 70,
    'BMI_FP': 24.2,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 80,
    'IKDC': 75,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': 1.5, # Below threshold for surgical group
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 45,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 50,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 120,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -80,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 50,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30,
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Abnormal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]


patient_data2 = {
    'Group': 0,  # Coper
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.0, # Above threshold for coper/noncoper group
    # ... other data ... (not used in this simplified tree)
}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(patient_data2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Normal)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]

```



This improved function provides a clearer structure and more meaningful predictions while still adhering to the depth-2 constraint. Remember that this is a simplification, and a real-world model would require much more data and a more sophisticated approach.
