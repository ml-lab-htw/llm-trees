Certainly! Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree you provided. This function returns a single prediction (`0` for normal, `1` for abnormal) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list of length 3 for the three decision nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the Group is 'surgical reconstruction' (encoded as 2)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Group'] == 2)

    # Node 1: Check if 'ccMF.D.T2.Me' (baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur) is less than or equal to 40
    nodes[1] = int(X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] <= 40)

    # Node 2: Check if 'Lysholm' score is greater than or equal to 80
    nodes[2] = int(X['Lysholm'] >= 80)

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Group == surgical reconstruction
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 40
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Lysholm >= 80
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** corresponds to the condition `Group == 2` (where 2 encodes 'surgical reconstruction'). If this condition is true (`nodes[0] == 1`), the cartilage thickness change is predicted to be abnormal (`prediction = 1`).
  
- **Node 1** checks if the `ccMF.D.T2.Me` value is less than or equal to 40. If true (`nodes[1] == 1`), the prediction is normal (`prediction = 0`).

- **Node 2** checks if the `Lysholm` score is greater than or equal to 80. If true (`nodes[2] == 1`), the prediction is normal (`prediction = 0`). If not, the prediction is abnormal (`prediction = 1`).

**How to Use the Function:**

You can call this function by passing a dictionary `X` with the required features. Make sure the keys in the dictionary match exactly with the feature names provided.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input data
X_sample = {
    'Group': 1,  # noncoper
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 42.5,
    'Lysholm': 78,
    # ... other features can be included but are not used in this decision tree
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print(f"Prediction: {'abnormal' if prediction == 1 else 'normal'}")
print(f"Decision path: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: abnormal
Decision path: [0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] == 0`: The patient is not in the 'surgical reconstruction' group.
- `nodes[1] == 0`: The `ccMF.D.T2.Me` value is not less than or equal to 40.
- `nodes[2] == 0`: The `Lysholm` score is not greater than or equal to 80.
- Since all conditions lead to the else clause at each decision point, the prediction is `abnormal`.

**Notes:**

- The function checks conditions in sequence, storing the truth value (`1` or `0`) of each condition in the `nodes` list.
- This implementation strictly follows the decision tree you provided.
- Ensure that the input feature values are correctly encoded as per the descriptions (e.g., `Group` should be `0`, `1`, or `2`).
