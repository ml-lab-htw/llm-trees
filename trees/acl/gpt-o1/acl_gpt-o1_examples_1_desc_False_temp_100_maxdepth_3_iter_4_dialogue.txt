Sure! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features (with exact keys as specified), and returns the prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal), along with a list `nodes` representing the truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    # Node 0: Group == surgical reconstruction
    nodes[0] = int(X['Group'] == 2)
    if nodes[0]:  # If Group is surgical reconstruction
        # Node 1: Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (mm) <= 2.5
        nodes[1] = int(X['ccmfthctabame'] <= 2.5)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: BMI (kg/m^2) <= 25.0
            nodes[2] = int(X['BMI_FP'] <= 25.0)
            # Prediction is abnormal regardless of BMI
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 not evaluated
            # Prediction is normal
            prediction = 0  # normal
        nodes[3] = None  # Nodes 3 and 4 not evaluated
        nodes[4] = None
    else:  # Group is not surgical reconstruction
        nodes[1] = None  # Nodes 1 and 2 not evaluated
        nodes[2] = None
        # Node 3: Baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms) <= 35.0
        nodes[3] = int(X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] <= 35.0)
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Lysholm score >= 80
            nodes[4] = int(X['Lysholm'] >= 80)
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            nodes[4] = None  # Node 4 not evaluated
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the `Group` is equal to `2` (surgical reconstruction).
  - `nodes[0] = int(X['Group'] == 2)`

- **If Node 0 is true (`Group == 2`):**

  - **Node 1:** Checks if `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur) is less than or equal to `2.5` mm.
    - `nodes[1] = int(X['ccmfthctabame'] <= 2.5)`

  - **If Node 1 is true:**

    - **Node 2:** Checks if `BMI_FP` is less than or equal to `25.0` kg/m².
      - `nodes[2] = int(X['BMI_FP'] <= 25.0)`

    - **Prediction:** Regardless of Node 2's outcome, the class is predicted as `abnormal` (`1`).

  - **If Node 1 is false:**

    - **Prediction:** The class is predicted as `normal` (`0`).

- **If Node 0 is false (`Group != 2`):**

  - **Node 3:** Checks if `ccMF.D.T2.Me` (baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers) is less than or equal to `35.0` ms.
    - `nodes[3] = int(X['ccMF.D.T2.Me'] <= 35.0)`

  - **If Node 3 is true:**

    - **Node 4:** Checks if `Lysholm` score is greater than or equal to `80`.
      - `nodes[4] = int(X['Lysholm'] >= 80)`

    - **If Node 4 is true:**

      - **Prediction:** The class is predicted as `normal` (`0`).

    - **If Node 4 is false:**

      - **Prediction:** The class is predicted as `abnormal` (`1`).

  - **If Node 3 is false:**

    - **Prediction:** The class is predicted as `abnormal` (`1`).

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- `'Group'`: group (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
- `'BMI_FP'`: BMI (kg/m²)
- `'Lysholm'`: Lysholm score
- `'ccmfthctabame'`: baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (mm)
- `'ccMF.D.T2.Me'`: baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms)

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature vector
X_example = {
    'Group': 2,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.3,
    'BMI_FP': 24.5,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 34.0,
    'Lysholm': 85,
    # ... other features
}

# Get prediction and nodes evaluation
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction (0=normal, 1=abnormal):", prediction)
print("Nodes evaluation:", nodes)
```

**Note:** The `nodes` list contains `1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` if not satisfied, and `None` if the node was not evaluated due to the decision path taken.

Please ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the exact keys and appropriate values as per their descriptions and encodings.
