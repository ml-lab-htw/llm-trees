Hereâ€™s a decision tree for the new set of features and target variable you provided, with a maximum depth of 4 and using a few key features to predict whether the cartilage thickness change is normal or abnormal:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] > 30  # Age factor
    nodes[2] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25  # BMI factor
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] > 50  # External peak knee moment around x-axis

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Normal
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0 (`ccmfthctabame` <= 2.5)**: This node checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.5 mm. This is a key indicator of cartilage status.
- **Node 1 (`Age` > 30)**: This node checks if the individual is older than 30 years. Age is often a factor in the recovery and progression of cartilage degeneration.
- **Node 2 (`BMI_FP` > 25)**: This node checks if the BMI is greater than 25, which would indicate overweight or obese status, often associated with worse outcomes in joint injuries.
- **Node 3 (`Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ` > 50)**: This node checks if the external peak knee moment around the x-axis is greater than 50 Nm, which could affect recovery and cartilage thickness.

This decision tree attempts to predict whether the cartilage thickness change over 12 months is normal or abnormal based on these key features.
