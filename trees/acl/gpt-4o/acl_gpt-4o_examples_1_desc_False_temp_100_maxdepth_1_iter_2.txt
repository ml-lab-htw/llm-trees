Sure! Let's construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 for the Features and the Target variable `x1`, which represents the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal).

Based on the provided features, we will assume that `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur) and perhaps one additional feature such as `Age` or `BMI_FP` might be relevant for predicting the target variable. For simplicity, let's use `ccmfthctabame` as the most important feature in the decision tree.

We will create a decision boundary based on the `ccmfthctabame` feature to separate between normal cartilage thickness change (0) and abnormal cartilage thickness change (1). Let’s assume that cartilage thickness below a certain threshold (e.g., 2.5 mm) is more likely to be abnormal.

Here’s the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision based on baseline mean cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame)
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree checks if the feature `ccmfthctabame` (the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur) is less than or equal to 2.5 mm.
- If it's less than or equal to 2.5 mm, the model predicts `1` (abnormal cartilage thickness change).
- If it's greater than 2.5 mm, the model predicts `0` (normal cartilage thickness change).
- The `nodes` list contains the truth value (`True` or `False`) for the inner node condition (`X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5`), represented as `1` for `True` (condition satisfied) and `0` for `False` (condition not satisfied).

### Usage Example:
```python
# Example input feature set
X = {
    "Group": 1,
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "Height": 180,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 75,
    "BMI_FP": 23.15,
    "Age": 29,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 90,
    "Tegner": 4,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.3,  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 35.2,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 27.1,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 12.5,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -8.3,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 14.7,
    "Dominant_Leg": 0,  # Left leg
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 30
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, if the `ccmfthctabame` value is 2.3 mm, the prediction will be `1` (abnormal cartilage thickness change), and the `nodes` will be `[1]`, indicating that the condition `X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5` is satisfied.
