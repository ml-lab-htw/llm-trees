Here is the `predict` function formatted as requested for the decision tree that classifies cartilage thickness change as **normal (0)** or **abnormal (1)**. The function uses the given features and adheres to the conventions specified:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] in [1, 2]  # 'noncoper' or 'surgical reconstruction' groups
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.4  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness threshold (mm)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:  # 'Group' is 'coper' (0)
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"] <= 20  # Knee moment threshold (Nm)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input:**
   - `X` is expected to be a dictionary with feature keys (e.g., `"Group"`, `"ccmfthctabame"`, `"Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"`) and their respective values.

2. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes` is a list that stores the truth values of the conditions at the decision tree’s inner nodes.
   - Node 0 splits the data based on the `"Group"` feature.
   - Node 1 either splits data based on `"ccmfthctabame"` (for noncopers/surgical reconstructions) or `"Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"` (for copers).

3. **Conditions:**
   - First condition (`nodes[0]`): Check if the individual belongs to the `noncoper` (`1`) or `surgical reconstruction` (`2`) groups.
   - Second condition (`nodes[1]`): For `noncoper` or `surgical reconstruction`, check if `"ccmfthctabame"` (baseline cartilage thickness) is ≤ 2.4 mm. If `coper`, check if `"Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"` (external peak knee moment on the y-axis) is ≤ 20 Nm.

4. **Predictions:**
   - If the conditions for the group and relevant features align with thresholds, the tree predicts an outcome:
     - **0 (Normal):** If cartilage change meets expected thresholds.
     - **1 (Abnormal):** If cartilage change exceeds thresholds.

5. **Output:**
   - `prediction`: The classification (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) as inferred by the decision tree.
   - `nodes`: A list of Boolean values indicating whether the conditions at the inner nodes are satisfied.

### Example Usage:

#### Input Data:
```python
X = {
    "Group": 1,  # noncoper
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 70,
    "BMI_FP": 24.2,
    "Age": 28,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 70,
    "Tegner": 4,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.3,  # Baseline cartilage thickness
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 30,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 26,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 12,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": 18,  # Y-axis peak knee moment
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 10,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 90
}
```

#### Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Abnormal)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

Explanation:
- `Group` is `1` (`noncoper`), so `nodes[0] = True`.
- `"ccmfthctabame"` is `2.3`, which is ≤ `2.4 mm`, so `nodes[1] = True`.
- Since both conditions are satisfied, the prediction is `1` (Abnormal).
