### Explanation:

1. **Node 1** splits on the "Group" feature:
   - If the individual is **not** a "noncoper" (i.e., they are either a "coper" or had "surgical reconstruction"), we proceed to evaluate the cartilage thickness with a different threshold.
   - If the individual **is** a "noncoper", the threshold for the cartilage thickness is set differently.

2. **Node 2** splits on "ccmfthctabame" (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur):
   - For "copers" or those who had "surgical reconstruction", a threshold of 2.8 mm is used.
   - For "noncopers", a lower threshold of 2.5 mm is used, indicating that thinner cartilage is more likely to lead to abnormal changes in this group.

3. **The final prediction** (either 0 for "normal" or 1 for "abnormal") is based on the combination of these two conditions.
