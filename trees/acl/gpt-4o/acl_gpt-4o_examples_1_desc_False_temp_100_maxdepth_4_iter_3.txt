Given the new set of features and the target variable `x1: cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)`, I will create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4, using 4-15 inner nodes as requested.

### Decision Tree:
In this tree, I will use a mix of features that seem relevant for predicting cartilage thickness change, such as `age`, `BMI_FP`, `ccmfthctabame`, `ccMF.D.T2.Me`, and `Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ`. These features are biological and biomechanical in nature, which could correlate with abnormal cartilage thickness change after injury.

Here is the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if baseline cartilage thickness is below a certain threshold
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5

    # Node 1: Check if BMI is in the overweight or obese range
    nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25

    # Node 2: Check if the baseline deep cartilage T2 values are above a certain threshold
    nodes[2] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] > 40

    # Node 3: Check if external peak knee moment around the x-axis exceeds a certain value
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] > 50

    # Start decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.5 mm
        if nodes[1]:  # BMI > 25 (overweight or obese)
            if nodes[2]:  # Deep cartilage T2 values > 40 ms
                if nodes[3]:  # Knee moment X > 50 Nm
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
            else:  # Deep cartilage T2 values <= 40 ms
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:  # BMI <= 25 (not overweight or obese)
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:  # Baseline cartilage thickness > 2.5 mm
        if nodes[2]:  # Deep cartilage T2 values > 40 ms
            if nodes[3]:  # Knee moment X > 50 Nm
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:  # Deep cartilage T2 values <= 40 ms
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0:** We first check if the baseline cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.5 mm. If it's below this threshold, it might indicate a risk for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
2. **Node 1:** Next, we check if the BMI (`BMI_FP`) is greater than 25, which would classify the individual as overweight or obese. This is important because higher BMI may increase the likelihood of cartilage issues.
3. **Node 2:** We then evaluate the baseline deep cartilage T2 values (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`). T2 values greater than 40 ms could indicate early cartilage degeneration, influencing the risk of abnormal cartilage thickness change.
4. **Node 3:** Finally, we check if the external peak knee moment around the x-axis (`Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ`) exceeds 50 Nm. High peak knee moments could stress the joint and contribute to abnormal cartilage change.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input data point
X = {
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.4,  # Baseline cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
    "BMI_FP": 28,  # Body mass index
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 45,  # Deep cartilage T2 value
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 55  # External peak knee moment around the x-axis
}

# Predict the outcome
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 = Abnormal, 0 = Normal
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values of the decision nodes
```

In this example, the decision nodes would evaluate as follows:
- Node 0 (`ccmfthctabame <= 2.5`): True
- Node 1 (`BMI_FP > 25`): True
- Node 2 (`ccMF.D.T2.Me > 40`): True
- Node 3 (`Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ > 50`): True

Thus, the prediction would be `1` (abnormal), as all conditions leading to an abnormal cartilage thickness change are satisfied.
