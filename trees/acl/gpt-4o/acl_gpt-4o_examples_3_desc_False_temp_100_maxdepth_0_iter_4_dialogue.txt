To create a decision tree function that aligns with your request, we'll use the features and thresholds as described. The function will check the conditions at each node and return a prediction as well as a list of truth values for the conditions checked at each internal node.

Here's the decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Create a list of 5 None elements for the nodes

    # Define the conditions at each node
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 1  # noncoper
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 0  # coper
    nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 30
    nodes[4] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 50

    if nodes[0]:  # baseline mean cartilage thickness <= 2.5
        if nodes[1]:  # noncoper
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # coper
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:  # surgical reconstruction (group == 2)
                if nodes[3]:  # Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ <= 30
                    prediction = 0  # normal
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:  # baseline mean cartilage thickness > 2.5
        if nodes[4]:  # baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers <= 50
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            if X["Age"] <= 25:
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    'Group': 2,  # surgical reconstruction
    'Sex': 1,
    'Height': 180,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 75,
    'BMI_FP': 23.1,
    'Age': 30,
    'Lysholm': 90,
    'IKDC': 85,
    'Tegner': 7,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.8,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 52,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 40,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 28,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -20,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 35,
    'Dominant_Leg': 0,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 100
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list called `nodes` with 5 None elements. Each index in this list will store whether a specific condition is met (True/False).
2. **Node Conditions**:
    - `nodes[0]` checks if `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness) is less than or equal to 2.5 mm.
    - `nodes[1]` checks if the `Group` is equal to `1` (noncoper).
    - `nodes[2]` checks if the `Group` is equal to `0` (coper).
    - `nodes[3]` checks if `Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ` is less than or equal to 30 Nm.
    - `nodes[4]` checks if `ccMF.D.T2.Me` (baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers) is less than or equal to 50 ms.
3. **Decision Structure**: The function uses these conditions to navigate through the tree and make a prediction.
4. **Output**: The function returns both the prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) and the list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions checked at each node.

This setup allows us to evaluate the prediction process and understand which conditions were met during the navigation through the tree.
