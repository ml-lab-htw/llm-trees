Here is a Python function that represents a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 5, based on the Features and target variable you provided. The decision tree is structured to predict whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury is normal (0) or abnormal (1). The tree uses the most important features, and the conditions within the nodes are chosen arbitrarily since no actual training data is available.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Age is a significant factor in predicting cartilage thickness change.
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] > 30
    
    # Node 1: BMI can influence structural joint changes after injury.
    nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25
    
    # Node 2: Group (coper, noncoper, surgical reconstruction) may affect recovery.
    nodes[2] = X["Group"] == 2  # Group 2 corresponds to surgical reconstruction
    
    # Node 3: The Lysholm score, which assesses knee function, could be predictive.
    nodes[3] = X["Lysholm"] > 80
    
    # Node 4: Days from injury to MRI can indicate if early intervention improves outcomes.
    nodes[4] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 60

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Age > 30
        if nodes[1]:  # BMI > 25
            if nodes[2]:  # Group == surgical reconstruction
                if nodes[3]:  # Lysholm > 80
                    if nodes[4]:  # days_injury_to_MRI <= 60
                        prediction = 0  # Normal
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Abnormal
                else:  # Lysholm <= 80
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal
            else:  # Group != surgical reconstruction
                prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:  # BMI <= 25
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:  # Age <= 30
        if nodes[1]:  # BMI > 25
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0 (Age > 30):** The first decision is made based on the age of the individual. If the person is older than 30, they might be at higher risk of having abnormal cartilage thickness change.
2. **Node 1 (BMI_FP > 25):** The next node looks at the BMI. A BMI over 25 suggests overweight or obesity, which may impact recovery and lead to abnormal outcomes.
3. **Node 2 (Group == 2):** This node checks whether the person underwent surgical reconstruction, which might improve outcomes.
4. **Node 3 (Lysholm > 80):** The Lysholm score, which assesses knee function, can indicate how well the knee is recovering. A high score (> 80) is generally considered good.
5. **Node 4 (days_injury_to_MRI <= 60):** This node evaluates whether the MRI was done within 60 days post-injury, which could indicate early intervention, potentially leading to more normal cartilage thickness.

### Output:
The function returns two values:
- `prediction`: 0 (Normal) or 1 (Abnormal).
- `nodes`: A list of truth values (1 or 0) representing whether the condition at each node was satisfied.

#### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Group": 2,
    "Sex": 1,
    "Height": 180,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 85,
    "BMI_FP": 26.2,
    "Age": 32,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 90,
    "Tegner": 5,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.5,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 40,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 30,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 20,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -5,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 10,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 45
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This will output whether the cartilage thickness change is predicted to be normal or abnormal based on the provided features, along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
