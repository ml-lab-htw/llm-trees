Based on the Features and the target variable you provided, I will now induce a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. The tree will have between 2 and 3 inner nodes, and I will select the most important features based on the context of cartilage thickness change after ACL injury.

Here’s the decision tree:

### Selected Features and Reason:

1. **ccmfthctabame (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur)**: This feature seems to directly relate to the target variable, as the baseline cartilage thickness is likely a strong predictor of cartilage changes over time.
   
2. **Age**: Age could be an important factor as younger individuals may have different healing or degenerative patterns compared to older individuals after an ACL injury.

3. **ccMF.D.T2.Me (T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur)**: This feature measures T2 relaxation times, which reflect cartilage composition and health, making it a useful predictor for cartilage changes.

Now, let’s build the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check age for further decision
        nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # More likely to have abnormal cartilage change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Less likely to have abnormal cartilage change
    else:
        # Node 1: Check T2 values for deep cartilage layers
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage change
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is made based on the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (`ccmfthctabame`). If the thickness is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, we proceed to Node 1.
   
2. **Node 1 (left branch)**: If the baseline cartilage thickness is low, we check the patient's **age**. If the person is younger than or equal to 30 years, they are more likely to have abnormal cartilage change (prediction = 1). Otherwise, the prediction is normal (prediction = 0).

3. **Node 1 (right branch)**: If the baseline cartilage thickness is greater than 2.5 mm, we check the **T2 values** of the deep cartilage layers (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`). If the T2 value is less than or equal to 40 ms, the cartilage change is likely normal (prediction = 0). Otherwise, the prediction is abnormal (prediction = 1).

This decision tree makes use of the most relevant features based on the context of cartilage thickness changes after ACL injury.
