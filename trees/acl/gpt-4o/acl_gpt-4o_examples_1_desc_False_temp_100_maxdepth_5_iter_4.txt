Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the provided Features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree structure
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] > 30
    nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] > 80
    nodes[3] = X["ccmfthctabame"] < 2.5
    nodes[4] = X["Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"] < -20

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
- **Node 0:** The first decision is based on whether the age is greater than 30 years. Older individuals might have a higher likelihood of abnormal cartilage changes.
- **Node 1:** If the age is greater than 30, the next decision checks if the BMI is greater than 25, which could indicate overweight or obesity, potentially contributing to abnormal changes.
- **Node 2:** Lysholm score greater than 80 is checked next, with higher scores indicating better knee function and potentially less risk of abnormal cartilage changes.
- **Node 3:** Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (ccmfthctabame) is checked, with values less than 2.5 mm potentially leading to abnormal cartilage changes.
- **Node 4:** The minimum external knee moment around the Y-axis (Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ) is considered next, with lower values potentially correlating with abnormal cartilage changes.

### Prediction:
- The function returns two things:
  1. **prediction:** The predicted label (0 = normal cartilage thickness change, 1 = abnormal cartilage thickness change).
  2. **nodes:** A list indicating whether each node's condition was satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false).

### Example Call:

X = {
    "Group": 1,
    "Sex": 0,
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 70,
    "BMI_FP": 24.2,
    "Age": 28,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 75,
    "Tegner": 4,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.7,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 42.0,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 50.0,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 12,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -18,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 8,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 200
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```
