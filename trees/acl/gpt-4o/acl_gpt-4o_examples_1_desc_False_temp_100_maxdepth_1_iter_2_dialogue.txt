def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Root node: decision based on Group
    # 0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 0  # Coper group
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the patient is a coper
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:  # Noncoper or surgical reconstruction
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` where the keys represent the feature names provided, and the values are the corresponding feature values.
- The decision tree uses the **"Group"** feature to decide the classification. 
  - If the patient is a **coper** (i.e., `Group == 0`), the prediction is **normal** (`0`).
  - If the patient is either a **noncoper** (`Group == 1`) or had **surgical reconstruction** (`Group == 2`), the prediction is **abnormal** (`1`).
- The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values (`nodes`), which indicates whether the condition at the inner node (in this case, `Group == 0`) is satisfied (`1` if True, `0` if False).
