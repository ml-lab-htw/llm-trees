Here's a decision tree of depth 3 based on the Features provided, where the target variable is "cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury" (`x1`), which is either 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Lysholm score <= 70. This is an important measure of knee function.
    nodes[0] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Age <= 30. Younger individuals might recover differently.
        nodes[1] = X["Age"] <= 30
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur <= 2.5 mm.
            nodes[2] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:
        # Node 1: Body mass index (BMI_FP) <= 25. Higher BMI may indicate a different prognosis.
        nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] <= 25
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: IKDC score <= 50. The IKDC score assesses knee function.
            nodes[2] = X["IKDC"] <= 50
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
1. **Node 0 (root):** The decision tree starts by checking if the `Lysholm` score is ≤ 70. A lower Lysholm score might suggest more significant injury or functional impairment, which could influence cartilage thickness outcomes.
   
2. **Left node of root (Node 1):** If `Lysholm` is ≤ 70, the tree checks if the patient is aged ≤ 30. Younger individuals often have different healing patterns or cartilage recovery compared to older individuals.

3. **Left-Left node (Node 2):** If the patient is ≤ 30, the tree checks if their baseline cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (`ccmfthctabame`) is ≤ 2.5 mm. Thinner cartilage might lead to abnormal thickness changes over time.

4. **Right node of root (Node 1):** If `Lysholm` is > 70, the tree checks if the patient's BMI is ≤ 25. A higher BMI (overweight/obesity) might be associated with worse cartilage outcomes.

5. **Right-Left node (Node 2):** If BMI is ≤ 25, the tree looks at the `IKDC` score, where a score ≤ 50 might suggest worse knee function, potentially leading to abnormal cartilage changes.

### Output:
The function returns:
- **`prediction`**: The predicted value for `x1` (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal).
- **`nodes`**: A list of boolean values indicating whether the condition at each node was satisfied (`1` if the condition is true, `0` otherwise).
