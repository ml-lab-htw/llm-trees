Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree you requested, formatted appropriately based on the features and target variable encoding you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # The tree has 7 decision nodes (inner nodes)
    
    # Node 0: IKDC score <= 45.0
    nodes[0] = X["IKDC"] <= 45.0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: days_injury_to_MRI <= 90
        nodes[1] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 90
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Class: abnormal (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Node 2: Tegner score <= 4
            nodes[2] = X["Tegner"] <= 4
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Class: abnormal (1)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Class: normal (0)
                prediction = 0
    else:
        # Node 3: ccmfthctabame (baseline mean cartilage thickness) <= 2.5 mm
        nodes[3] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Lysholm score <= 65
            nodes[4] = X["Lysholm"] <= 65
            
            if nodes[4]:
                # Class: abnormal (1)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Class: normal (0)
                prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 5: Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ (external peak knee moment around y-axis) <= 25 Nm
            nodes[5] = X["Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"] <= 25
            
            if nodes[5]:
                # Class: normal (0)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # Class: abnormal (1)
                prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list tracks whether each decision point (inner node) condition is satisfied (`True`, i.e., 1) or not (`False`, i.e., 0). This way, you can see the path the prediction follows through the decision tree.
   
2. **Conditions**:
   - **IKDC score <= 45.0**: This checks overall knee function.
   - **days_injury_to_MRI <= 90**: This binary condition checks how soon after the injury the MRI scan was taken.
   - **Tegner score <= 4**: If the Tegner score is low, it suggests a lower physical activity level, which could imply a worse outcome.
   - **ccmfthctabame (baseline mean cartilage thickness) <= 2.5 mm**: Thin cartilage is a potential indicator of abnormal outcomes.
   - **Lysholm score <= 65**: A lower Lysholm score is a sign of worse recovery.
   - **Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ <= 25 Nm**: This biomechanical feature examines the stress on the knee joint during movement.

3. **Predictions**:
   - **1**: Abnormal cartilage thickness change.
   - **0**: Normal cartilage thickness change.

### Example of Usage:

```python
X = {
    "Group": 1,
    "Sex": 0,
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 70,
    "BMI_FP": 24,
    "Age": 25,
    "Lysholm": 70,
    "IKDC": 50,
    "Tegner": 5,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.6,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 40,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 42,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 20,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": 24,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 15,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 100
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Output:

```
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [False, None, None, False, None, True, None]
```

This indicates that the decision-making process went through the tree, and the model predicted a **normal** cartilage thickness change (`0`), with the corresponding truth values of the inner nodes.
