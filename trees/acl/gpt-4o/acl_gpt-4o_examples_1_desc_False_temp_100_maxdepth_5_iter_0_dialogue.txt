    # Node 0: Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (ccmfthctabame)

### Explanation of the Function:
- The function `predict` accepts a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
- The tree is structured with a maximum depth of 5, where each node represents a decision based on one of the features you provided.
- For each node, a condition is checked (e.g., whether baseline cartilage thickness is less than or equal to a threshold), and the truth value (1 if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 0) is stored in the `nodes` list.
- Based on the decision path through the tree, the function returns a `prediction` (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) along with the list `nodes`, which contains the truth values of the conditions at each node.

### Example of Usage:

```python
X = {
    'Group': 1,  # Noncoper
    'Sex': 0,  # Female
    'Height': 170,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 65,
    'BMI_FP': 22.5,
    'Age': 28,
    'Lysholm': 85,
    'IKDC': 80,
    'Tegner': 5,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.4,  # Baseline cartilage thickness
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 35,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 45,  # T2 values for superficial layers
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 50,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': 25,  # Knee moment around y-axis
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 40,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,  # Right leg
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 150  # Days from injury to MRI
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This approach allows you to make predictions using a decision tree classifier that was manually designed based on domain expertise, without requiring actual data for training.
