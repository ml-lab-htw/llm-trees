        prediction = 1
    else:
        # If the patient is a coper or noncoper, move to the second decision
        if nodes[1]:
            # If baseline mean cartilage thickness is <= 2.3 mm, predict abnormal (cartilage thickness change = 1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If baseline mean cartilage thickness is > 2.3 mm, predict normal (cartilage thickness change = 0)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0 (`Group == 2`)**: The first split checks if the individual has undergone surgical reconstruction. If true, the prediction is "abnormal" (1). If false, we move to the next decision.
2. **Node 1 (`ccmfthctabame <= 2.3`)**: For individuals who are either copers (Group = 0) or noncopers (Group = 1), the second split checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.3 mm. If true, the prediction is "abnormal" (1). If false, the prediction is "normal" (0).
   
This function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values (`nodes`), where each entry corresponds to whether the condition at each node was satisfied.
