Based on the features and the target variable you provided, I will create a decision tree model with a maximum depth of 2. The decision tree will use the most important features related to cartilage thickness change prediction. I will limit the depth to 2, which means there will be between 2 and 3 inner nodes (decision points).

After considering the provided features, I will select "ccMF.D.T2.Me" (baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur), "Lysholm" (Lysholm score), and "Age" (age in years) as likely important factors for predicting cartilage thickness change.

Here is the decision tree, formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur
    nodes[0] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 50
    
    # Node 2: Lysholm score as an indicator of knee function
    nodes[1] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 1**: The first decision is based on the baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`). If the value is less than or equal to 50 ms, we proceed to Node 2; otherwise, the prediction is "abnormal" (1).
   
2. **Node 2**: If the first condition is satisfied (i.e., `ccMF.D.T2.Me` <= 50), the next decision is based on the Lysholm score. If the Lysholm score is less than or equal to 70, the prediction will be "abnormal" (1), otherwise, it will be "normal" (0).

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "Group": 1,
    "Sex": 0,
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 68,
    "BMI_FP": 23.5,
    "Age": 25,
    "Lysholm": 75,
    "IKDC": 85,
    "Tegner": 4,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.5,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 48,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 55,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 40,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -30,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 25,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 30
}
```

### Example Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Normal cartilage thickness change expected)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, False]
```

In this example, since "ccMF.D.T2.Me" is 48 (which is <= 50), we move to Node 2. The Lysholm score of 75 is greater than 70, so the prediction is "normal" (0).
