Given your new set of features and the target variable, I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3, as requested. The decision tree will have between 3 and 7 inner nodes and will use the most important features for predicting the target variable, which is `x1: cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)`.

Below is the decision tree represented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: age <= 30
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] <= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: BMI_FP > 25 (Overweight or Obese)
        nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: days_injury_to_MRI > 200
            nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] > 200
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        # Node 1: Lysholm <= 70
        nodes[1] = X["Lysholm"] <= 70
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: ccMF.D.T2.Me > 50 (baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers)
            nodes[2] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] > 50
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

- **Node 0** checks if the person's age is less than or equal to 30.
    - If *true*, it goes to **Node 1**, which checks if their BMI is greater than 25 (which would indicate they are overweight or obese).
        - If *true*, it goes to **Node 2**, which checks if the time from injury to MRI is greater than 200 days.
            - If *true*, it predicts an abnormal cartilage thickness change.
            - Otherwise, it predicts a normal cartilage thickness change.
        - If *false* (BMI is less than or equal to 25), the model predicts normal cartilage thickness change.
    - If *false* (age is greater than 30), it goes to **Node 1**, which checks if the Lysholm score (a subjective knee function score) is less than or equal to 70.
        - If *true*, it goes to **Node 2**, which checks if the baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers are greater than 50.
            - If *true*, it predicts an abnormal cartilage thickness change.
            - Otherwise, it predicts normal cartilage thickness change.
        - If *false*, it predicts normal cartilage thickness change.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Group": 0,  # Coper
    "Sex": 1,  # Male
    "Height": 175,  # Height in cm
    "Body_Mass_FP": 80,  # Body mass in kg
    "BMI_FP": 26,  # BMI over 25 (overweight)
    "Age": 28,  # Age less than or equal to 30
    "Lysholm": 65,  # Lysholm score less than 70
    "IKDC": 45,  # IKDC score
    "Tegner": 7,  # Tegner score
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.1,  # Baseline cartilage thickness in mm
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 55,  # Baseline mean T2 for deep layers > 50
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 45,  # Baseline mean T2 for superficial layers
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 10,  # External peak knee moment (x-axis)
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -5,  # External peak knee moment (y-axis)
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 15,  # External peak knee moment (z-axis)
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,  # Right leg dominant
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 300  # Days from injury to MRI > 200
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example:
- The prediction would be `1`, indicating an abnormal cartilage thickness change.
- The nodes list might look like `[True, True, True]`, indicating that all the conditions in the decision tree were satisfied.

This decision tree is designed to focus on age, BMI, days from injury to MRI, Lysholm score, and T2 values, which are likely important factors in predicting cartilage thickness changes based on the context of the features.
