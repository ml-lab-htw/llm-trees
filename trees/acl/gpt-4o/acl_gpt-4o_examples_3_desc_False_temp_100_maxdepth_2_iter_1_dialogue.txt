Here is the Python implementation of the decision tree for your cartilage thickness classification problem, with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # We have two decision nodes
    # First split based on baseline mean cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.65
    # Second split based on baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 46.5 if not nodes[0] else None

    if nodes[0]:  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness <= 2.65
        prediction = 1  # "Abnormal"
    else:  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness > 2.65
        if nodes[1]:  # Baseline mean T2 values for superficial layers <= 46.5
            prediction = 0  # "Normal"
        else:  # Baseline mean T2 values for superficial layers > 46.5
            prediction = 1  # "Abnormal"

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`)**:
   - The first condition evaluates whether the baseline mean cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.65 mm. If this condition is satisfied (`True`), the cartilage thickness change is classified as **"Abnormal"** (value 1 in the target variable).

2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`)**:
   - If the first condition is not satisfied (`ccmfthctabame > 2.65`), the decision moves to the second condition, which evaluates whether the baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers (`ccMF.S.T2.Me`) are less than or equal to 46.5 ms. If this condition is satisfied (`True`), the cartilage thickness change is classified as **"Normal"** (value 0). Otherwise, it is classified as **"Abnormal"** (value 1).

3. **Prediction**:
   - The function returns the final prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values (`nodes`) representing whether the conditions at each decision node were satisfied.

### Example:
If we want to test the function on a sample input:

```python
X_sample = {
    "Group": 1,  # Noncoper
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "Height": 170,  # cm
    "Body_Mass_FP": 65,  # kg
    "BMI_FP": 22.5,  # kg/m^2
    "Age": 25,  # years
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 75,
    "Tegner": 5,
    "ccmfthctabame": 3.0,  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 40,  # Deep cartilage T2 value
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 45,  # Superficial cartilage T2 value
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 10,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -8,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 15,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,  # Right leg
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 180,  # days
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 0 (Normal)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Nodes: [False, True]
```

### Output for the Example:
Here’s what the function would return based on the above input:
- **Prediction**: `0` (Normal cartilage thickness change)
- **Nodes**:
  - `[False, True]`: 
    - First node condition (`ccmfthctabame <= 2.65`): `False` (because 3.0 > 2.65)
    - Second node condition (`ccMF.S.T2.Me <= 46.5`): `True` (because 45 ≤ 46.5)

This format ensures that you not only get the prediction but also the status of the decision nodes, which can be helpful for tracing the decision-making process.
