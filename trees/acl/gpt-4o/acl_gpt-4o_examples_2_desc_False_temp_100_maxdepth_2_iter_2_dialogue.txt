Here is a Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for predicting whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury is normal (`0`) or abnormal (`1`). The function includes conditions for each inner node as well as a list indicating whether each node's condition is satisfied (`1`) or not satisfied (`0`).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the cartilage thickness change is normal (0) or abnormal (1)
    based on features and a decision tree of depth 2.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): Input features with keys matching the dataset structure
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 for normal, 1 for abnormal
        nodes (list of int): Truth values of the inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # List to store truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check the 'Group' feature
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 2  # Group = surgical reconstruction
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Group == surgical reconstruction, it's abnormal
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Check the next condition depending on the group
        if X["Group"] == 0:  # Group == coper
            nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness ≤ 2.5 mm
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal if cartilage thickness is ≤ 2.5 mm
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal otherwise
        elif X["Group"] == 1:  # Group == noncoper
            nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40.0  # Baseline mean T2 values for deep layer ≤ 40.0 ms
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 0  # Normal if T2 values are ≤ 40.0 ms
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal otherwise
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

#### Input:
- `X`: A dictionary containing the features from the dataset. The keys must exactly match the feature names provided (`['Group', 'ccmfthctabame', 'ccMF.D.T2.Me', ...]`).

#### Decision Tree Logic:
1. **Node 0 (`Group`)**: 
   - If `Group == 2` (surgical reconstruction), classify as `abnormal` (1).
2. Else:
   - **Node 1 (`ccmfthctabame` for copers)**:
     - For `Group == 0` (copers): 
       - Check if `ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness) is `≤ 2.5 mm`. If true, classify as `abnormal` (1); otherwise, classify as `normal` (0).
   - **Node 1 (`ccMF.D.T2.Me` for noncopers)**:
     - For `Group == 1` (noncopers):
       - Check if `ccMF.D.T2.Me` (T2 values for deep cartilage layer) is `≤ 40.0 ms`. If true, classify as `normal` (0); otherwise, classify as `abnormal` (1).

#### Output:
1. `prediction`: The classification result (`0` for normal, `1` for abnormal).
2. `nodes`: A list of truth values (1 for "condition satisfied", 0 for "condition not satisfied") for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input 1: Surgical reconstruction
X1 = {
    "Group": 2,
    "ccmfthctabame": 3.0,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 44.0,
    # Other features are ignored as they are not used in the decision tree
}
prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [1, None]

# Example input 2: Coper with low cartilage thickness
X2 = {
    "Group": 0,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.0,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 35.0,
}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}, Nodes: {nodes2}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0, 1]

# Example input 3: Noncoper with low T2 values
X3 = {
    "Group": 1,
    "ccmfthctabame": 3.5,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 38.0,
}
prediction3, nodes3 = predict(X3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction3}, Nodes: {nodes3}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0, 1]
```

This `predict` function ensures the decision tree logic is clearly implemented, and the `nodes` list provides additional insight into which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process. Adjust thresholds or feature importances as needed based on your specific dataset.
