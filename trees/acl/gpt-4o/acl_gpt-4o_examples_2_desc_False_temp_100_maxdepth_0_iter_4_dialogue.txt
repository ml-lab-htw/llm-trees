Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree as described earlier. This function takes a dictionary of features and returns a prediction (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal) along with a list that represents the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate nodes
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    nodes[1] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 30
    nodes[2] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40.0
    nodes[3] = X["IKDC"] <= 50.0
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
1. The function initializes a list `nodes` with 4 elements (each corresponding to a decision point in the tree).
2. Each decision point is evaluated and stored in the `nodes` list:
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.5 mm.
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the days from injury to baseline MRI are less than or equal to 30 days.
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers are less than or equal to 40.0 ms.
    - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the IKDC score is less than or equal to 50.0.
3. The decision tree logic is then executed based on the values in `nodes`, leading to a final prediction which is either 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal).
4. The function returns the prediction along with the list of node evaluations.

You can use this function by passing a dictionary of features as follows:

```python
features = {
    'Group': 1, 
    'Sex': 0, 
    'Height': 175, 
    'Body_Mass_FP': 78, 
    'BMI_FP': 25.5, 
    'Age': 30, 
    'Lysholm': 85, 
    'IKDC': 65, 
    'Tegner': 3, 
    'ccmfthctabame': 3.0, 
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 41.0, 
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 30.0, 
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 4.0, 
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -2.0, 
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 5.0, 
    'Dominant_Leg': 0, 
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 35
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This will print the prediction and the list of node evaluations, indicating which conditions were satisfied along the path to the final prediction.
