```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the truth values of the inner nodes (depth 1)
    nodes = 1 * [None]

    # Decision rule based on the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (ccmfthctabame)
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Threshold of 2.5 mm based on prior knowledge

    # Prediction based on the evaluation of the first node (depth 1)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If baseline cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, classify as abnormal (1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # If baseline cartilage thickness is greater than 2.5 mm, classify as normal (0)
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where each key corresponds to one of the features provided.
- The decision tree has only one internal node, which checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.5 mm.
- The function returns two things:
  1. **Prediction**: `1` if the cartilage thickness change is predicted to be abnormal, `0` if it is predicted to be normal.
  2. **Nodes**: A list that contains the truth value of the internal node condition (whether the threshold condition at the node was satisfied or not). In this case, there is only one node, so the list contains one boolean value.
