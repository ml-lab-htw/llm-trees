```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Condition for the root node (depth 1)
    # baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms)
    nodes[0] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40.0
    
    # Decision based on the root node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # class: normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # class: abnormal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Root node check**: The decision tree uses the feature `ccMF.D.T2.Me` (baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur) with a threshold of `40.0 ms`. This threshold reflects a meaningful cutoff based on cartilage integrity, where values higher than 40 ms may indicate abnormal cartilage changes over time.
- **Nodes list**: The `nodes` list captures the truth value of the condition at the root node (whether the T2 value is less than or equal to 40.0 ms). This allows tracking of which conditions were satisfied during the decision-making process.
- **Prediction**: The function returns `0` (normal) if the condition is true, and `1` (abnormal) if the condition is false. 

You can pass an input dictionary `X` with the feature keys exactly matching those provided to receive both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
