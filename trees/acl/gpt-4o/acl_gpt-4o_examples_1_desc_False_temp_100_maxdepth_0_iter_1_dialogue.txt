### Explanation:
- **Node 1** checks if the individual belongs to the "noncoper" group (i.e., if `"Group" == 1`). This is based on the assumption that noncopers are more likely to experience abnormal cartilage thickness changes.
  
- **Node 2 (for noncopers)** checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.5 mm. Thinner cartilage at baseline could indicate a higher risk of abnormal changes over 12 months.

- **Node 2 (for copers or surgical reconstruction)** checks if the baseline mean T2 value for the deep cartilage layers (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`) is less than or equal to 50 ms. Elevated T2 values often indicate cartilage degeneration, which is more likely to lead to abnormal changes.
