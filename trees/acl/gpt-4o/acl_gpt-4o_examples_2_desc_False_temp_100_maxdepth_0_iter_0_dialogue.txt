To create a decision tree function in Python that fits the provided criteria, we'll implement it based on our simplified decision tree example. We'll also ensure that the function adheres closely to the format and feature keys as specified.

Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree to predict whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury is normal (0) or abnormal (1):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = X["Lysholm"] <= 60  # Condition for Node 0
    
    # Branch based on condition at Node 0
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Condition for Node 1 inside "Lysholm <= 60" branch
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:
        nodes[2] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 30  # Condition for Node 2 inside "Lysholm > 60" branch
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal

    return prediction, nodes

# Example input dictionary (replace with actual values or use for testing)
example_input = {
    'Group': 1,
    'Sex': 0,
    'Height': 170,
    'Body_Mass_FP': 70,
    'BMI_FP': 24.2,
    'Age': 25,
    'Lysholm': 55,
    'IKDC': 75,
    'Tegner': 3,
    'ccmfthctabame': 2.4,
    'ccMF.D.T2.Me': 45,
    'ccMF.S.T2.Me': 28,
    'Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ': 120,
    'Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ': -50,
    'Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ': 80,
    'Dominant_Leg': 1,
    'days_injury_to_MRI': 30
}

# Example usage
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Conditions**: Each `node` represents a condition in the decision tree:
   - Node 0: `Lysholm` score ≤ 60
   - Node 1: `baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur` (ccmfthctabame) ≤ 2.5
   - Node 2: `baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers in the central medial femur` (ccMF.S.T2.Me) ≤ 30

2. **Tree Logic**:
   - If the `Lysholm` score is 60 or less, we proceed to Node 1.
   - If Node 1 condition is met (cartilage thickness ≤ 2.5 mm), we classify as abnormal `(1)`.
   - If Node 1 condition is not met, we still classify as abnormal `(1)`.
   - If the `Lysholm` score is greater than 60, we proceed to Node 2.
   - If Node 2 condition is met (T2 values ≤ 30 ms), we classify as normal `(0)`.
   - If Node 2 condition is not met, we classify as abnormal `(1)`.

3. **Return Values**:
   - `prediction` is the predicted class (0 for normal, 1 for abnormal).
   - `nodes` is a list of boolean values representing whether each node's condition was satisfied (`True` or `False`).

Feel free to use this function in your testing and prediction environments. Adjust the feature thresholds as needed based on further analysis or additional domain-specific insights.
