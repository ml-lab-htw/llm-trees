Here is the Python function representing the decision tree you requested. The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values. It returns a prediction (0 for "normal" and 1 for "abnormal") based on the decision tree logic, and a list of truth values indicating whether the conditions at each inner node were satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 9 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check the 'Group' (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # Group == noncoper
        # Node 1: Check the IKDC score
        nodes[1] = X["IKDC"] <= 60

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            # Node 2: Check baseline cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
            nodes[2] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # Group != noncoper
        # Node 3: Check if Group == coper
        nodes[3] = X["Group"] == 0

        if nodes[3]:  # Group == coper
            # Node 4: Check the Tegner score
            nodes[4] = X["Tegner"] <= 4

            if nodes[4]:
                # Node 5: Check the T2 values for deep cartilage layers
                nodes[5] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 35

                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                # Node 6: Check external peak knee moment around z-axis
                nodes[6] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] <= 50

                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # Group == surgical reconstruction
            # Node 7: Check the number of days from injury to baseline MRI
            nodes[7] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 180

            if nodes[7]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                # Node 8: Check the T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers
                nodes[8] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] <= 45

                if nodes[8]:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list contains the results of each condition check. Each element is either `True` (condition satisfied) or `False` (condition not satisfied). This list will help track which conditions were met during the decision-making process.

2. **Decision Logic**:
   - The root node (node 0) checks whether the patient belongs to the "noncoper" group (Group == 1). 
   - If the patient is a "noncoper", the decision is based on the **IKDC score** and **baseline cartilage thickness**.
   - If the patient is a "coper" (Group == 0), the decision is based on the **Tegner score**, **T2 values for the deep cartilage layers**, and **knee moments**.
   - If the patient has undergone **surgical reconstruction** (Group == 2), the decision is based on the **number of days from injury to MRI** and the **T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers**.

3. **Feature Thresholds**:
   - Thresholds like `2.5 mm` for cartilage thickness and `35 ms` or `45 ms` for T2 values are based on plausible values given the nature of cartilage health markers.
   - Similarly, the IKDC score of `60` and Tegner score of `4` are reasonable cutoffs based on common clinical scoring systems for knee function and activity level.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Sample input for a patient
X = {
    "Group": 0,  # coper
    "Sex": 1,  # male
    "Height": 180,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 80,
    "BMI_FP": 24.7,
    "Age": 25,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 70,
    "Tegner": 5,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.8,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 36,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 30,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 10,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -5,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 45,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 100
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the function would return `prediction = 0` (normal cartilage thickness change) and a list of truth values corresponding to the nodes visited during the decision-making process.
