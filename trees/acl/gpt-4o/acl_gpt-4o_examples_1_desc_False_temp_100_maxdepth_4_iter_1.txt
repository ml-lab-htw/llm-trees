Here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 4, based on the Features provided for predicting `x1: cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)`.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check BMI_FP (important for body weight and joint stress)
    nodes[0] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25  # Overweight threshold
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check whether the patient is in the noncoper or surgical reconstruction group
        nodes[1] = X["Group"] == 1 or X["Group"] == 2  # Non-coper or surgical reconstruction
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check the Lysholm score (important for joint health)
            nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] < 70  # Lower Lysholm score indicates worse outcome
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Check Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ (important for knee stability)
                nodes[3] = X["Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"] < -30  # More negative values indicate higher forces
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            # Node 2 (alternative path): Check if age is a factor
            nodes[2] = X["Age"] > 35  # Age can influence recovery outcomes
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        # Node 1 (alternative path): Check if ccMF.S.T2.Me is high (cartilage T2 signal values)
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.S.T2.Me"] > 45  # Higher values indicate worse cartilage condition
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check Dominant_Leg (whether the injury is on the dominant leg)
            nodes[2] = X["Dominant_Leg"] == 1  # Injury on dominant leg
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
- **Node 0:** The tree first checks the `BMI_FP` (body mass index) to see if the patient is overweight (BMI > 25). This is a relevant feature because excess weight can put additional stress on the knee and affect cartilage health.
  
- **Node 1:** If the patient is overweight, the next check is whether they belong to the noncoper or surgical reconstruction group (`Group == 1 or Group == 2`), which may imply worse outcomes.

- **Node 2:** If the patient is in the noncoper or surgical reconstruction group, the model evaluates the Lysholm score (`Lysholm < 70`), which is a functional score for knee health. A low Lysholm score signals worse outcomes.

- **Node 3:** If the patient has a low Lysholm score, the model checks the `Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ` value to assess knee stability. A very negative knee moment indicates higher instability, which could lead to abnormal cartilage thickness change.

- **Alternative paths** (when the patient is not overweight):
  - The model evaluates the `ccMF.S.T2.Me` (T2 signal for the superficial cartilage) and the dominant leg to determine if the cartilage condition is abnormal.

### Output:
The function returns:
1. **Prediction:** `0` for normal cartilage thickness change, `1` for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
2. **Nodes:** A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions at each of the decision nodes.
