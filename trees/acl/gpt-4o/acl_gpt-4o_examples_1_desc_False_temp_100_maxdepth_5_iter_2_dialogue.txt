### Explanation:
1. **Nodes List:** The list `nodes` stores the truth values of the conditions at each internal decision node of the tree. Each node corresponds to a condition in the decision process, and it stores `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
   
2. **Node 0:** The first split is based on `ccmfthctabame` (baseline cartilage thickness in the central medial femur). If this value is ≤ 2.5 mm, it's more likely to indicate abnormal thinning, so we proceed down the left branch.

3. **Node 1:** If the cartilage is already thin, we further check the `Lysholm` score. A lower Lysholm score (≤ 70) indicates poor knee function and pain, which is more likely associated with abnormal cartilage change.

4. **Node 2:** If the `Lysholm` score is acceptable (> 70), we then check the `Age`. Younger individuals (≤ 30) are more resilient and more likely to have normal cartilage outcomes.

5. **Node 3:** If the baseline cartilage thickness is > 2.5 mm, we check the `ccMF.D.T2.Me` (T2 values in the deep cartilage layers). High T2 values (> 40 ms) indicate potential cartilage degeneration.

6. **Node 4:** If the T2 values are high, we check the `Tegner` score. Lower activity levels (Tegner ≤ 5) are correlated with worse outcomes, thus indicating abnormal cartilage changes.

### Output:
- `prediction`: Returns `0` for normal cartilage thickness change and `1` for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
- `nodes`: A list of binary values representing whether the condition at each decision node was satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`). This helps in explaining the decision process.
