Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the most important features: `Group` and `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur). The thresholds are chosen based on reasonable assumptions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months
    following anterior cruciate ligament injury is normal (0) or abnormal (1).

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the Group feature
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 0  # Group == 0 (coper)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Group == coper
        # Node 1: Check the baseline mean cartilage thickness
        nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.5 mm
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:  # If Group != coper (noncoper or surgical reconstruction)
        # Node 1: Check the baseline mean cartilage thickness
        nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.0  # Baseline cartilage thickness <= 2.0 mm
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names (e.g., `"Group"`, `"ccmfthctabame"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values for a single instance.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry is `1` if the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.
3. **Node 0**: The first split checks whether the `Group` feature is `0` (coper). If true, the function proceeds to the next condition for copers; otherwise, it proceeds to the condition for noncopers or surgical reconstruction.
4. **Node 1**: The second split checks the baseline mean cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) with thresholds of `2.5 mm` for copers and `2.0 mm` for noncopers/surgical reconstruction.
5. **Prediction**: Based on the conditions, the function assigns a prediction of `0` (normal) or `1` (abnormal).
6. **Output**: The function returns the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Group": 0,  # coper
    "Sex": 1,  # male
    "Height": 175,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 70,
    "BMI_FP": 22.9,
    "Age": 25,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 80,
    "Tegner": 6,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.3,  # baseline cartilage thickness
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 40,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 50,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 10,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -5,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 15,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,  # right
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 30
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Normal)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Notes:
1. The thresholds (`2.5 mm` and `2.0 mm`) are placeholders based on reasonable assumptions. These should be adjusted based on actual data analysis.
2. The function is designed to be simple and interpretable, following the structure of the decision tree provided earlier.
