Here is the Python function for your decision tree based on the provided feature keys and target variable encoding:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months
    following anterior cruciate ligament injury is normal (0) or abnormal (1).
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features with exact keys as described.
        
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 if normal, 1 if abnormal.
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) 
                      for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 1: Baseline mean cartilage thickness (ccmfthctabame) <= 2.5
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    
    # Inner node 2: Baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers (ccMF.D.T2.Me) <= 40
    if nodes[0]:  # If the first condition is satisfied
        nodes[1] = None  # No further split for this branch
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40
        if nodes[1]:  # If the second condition is satisfied
            prediction = 0  # Normal
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
