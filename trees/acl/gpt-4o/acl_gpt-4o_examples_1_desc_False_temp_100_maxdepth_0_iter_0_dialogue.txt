Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the features you provided, with a maximum depth of 2. The function will return a prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Split based on the 'Group' feature (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 1  # noncoper
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Split based on 'ccMF.D.T2.Me' (baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers)
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40.0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        # Node 1: Split based on 'ccmfthctabame' (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur)
        nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the "Group" feature. If the patient is in the "noncoper" group (`Group == 1`), the tree moves to the left. Otherwise, it moves to the right for "coper" or "surgical reconstruction" groups.
  
- **Left Branch (noncoper)**:
  - The second decision is based on the "ccMF.D.T2.Me" feature, which is the baseline mean T2 value for the deep cartilage layers. If this value is less than or equal to 40.0 ms, the cartilage thickness change is predicted to be **normal** (0). If it’s greater than 40.0 ms, the prediction is **abnormal** (1).

- **Right Branch (coper or surgical reconstruction)**:
  - The second decision is based on "ccmfthctabame", which is the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur. If this value is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, the cartilage change is predicted to be **abnormal** (1). Otherwise, it’s predicted to be **normal** (0).

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "Group": 1,  # noncoper
    "Sex": 0,  # female
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 65,
    "BMI_FP": 22.5,
    "Age": 35,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 75,
    "Tegner": 4,
    "ccmfthctabame": 3.0,  # baseline mean cartilage thickness
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 42.0,  # baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 45.0,  # baseline mean T2 values for superficial cartilage layers
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 50,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -20,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 30,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,  # right
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 90
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the function will output the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) based on the input features and a list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met in the decision tree.
