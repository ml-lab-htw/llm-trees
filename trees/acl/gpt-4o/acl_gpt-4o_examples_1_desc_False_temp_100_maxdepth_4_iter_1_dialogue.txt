### Explanation:
- **Node 0:** The first split checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.5 mm. This is a key factor for classifying normal vs. abnormal changes.
- **Node 1:** If the thickness is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, we check if the patient is a noncoper (`Group == 1`).
  - If the patient is a **noncoper**, we then consider the baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers (`ccMF.S.T2.Me`), with a threshold of 40.5 ms.
    - If the T2 value is <= 40.5 ms, we predict an **abnormal** cartilage change.
    - If the T2 value is > 40.5 ms, we predict a **normal** cartilage change.
  - If the patient is **not a noncoper**, we check the IKDC score (`IKDC`) to assess knee function.
    - If the IKDC score is <= 45, we predict an **abnormal** cartilage change.
    - If the IKDC score is > 45, we predict a **normal** cartilage change.
- **Node 4:** If the baseline cartilage thickness is greater than 2.5 mm, we look at the baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`), with a threshold of 35 ms.
  - If the T2 value is <= 35 ms, we further check how many days have passed since the injury to the baseline MRI (`days_injury_to_MRI`). If it is <= 180 days, we predict an **abnormal** cartilage change; otherwise, we predict a **normal** change.
  - If the T2 value is > 35 ms, we predict an **abnormal** cartilage change.

### Output:
- **Prediction:** The function returns either 0 (normal) or 1 (abnormal).
- **Nodes:** A list of 0s and 1s representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).
