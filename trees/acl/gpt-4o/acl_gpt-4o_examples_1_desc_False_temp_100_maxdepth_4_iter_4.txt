Based on the Features and the target variable you provided, I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4. Here's the decision tree in Python format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 1: Age as a decision factor
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] > 30
    
    # Inner node 2: BMI as a decision factor
    nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] >= 25
    
    # Inner node 3: External peak knee moment around y-axis
    nodes[2] = X["Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ"] < -50
    
    # Inner node 4: Lysholm score as a decision factor
    nodes[3] = X["Lysholm"] > 75
    
    # Decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # Age > 30
        if nodes[1]:  # BMI >= 25
            if nodes[2]:  # Knee Moment Y < -50
                if nodes[3]:  # Lysholm > 75
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Lysholm > 75
                    prediction = 0  # normal
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  # BMI < 25
            if nodes[2]:  # Knee Moment Y < -50
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal
    else:  # Age <= 30
        if nodes[1]:  # BMI >= 25
            prediction = 1  # abnormal
        else:  
            if nodes[3]:  # Lysholm > 75
                prediction = 0  # normal
            else:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
1. **Node 0 (Age)**: If the subject is older than 30 years, we move to the next decision.
2. **Node 1 (BMI_FP)**: If the BMI of the subject is greater than or equal to 25 (overweight or obese), the risk of abnormal cartilage thickness change increases.
3. **Node 2 (Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ)**: If the external peak knee moment around the y-axis is less than -50 Nm, this suggests a more significant biomechanical load, which could increase the risk of abnormal cartilage thickness change.
4. **Node 3 (Lysholm)**: A Lysholm score greater than 75 indicates better knee function, which may reduce the likelihood of abnormal cartilage thickness change.

The prediction can be either **0 (normal)** or **1 (abnormal)** based on the decision path. The list `nodes` contains the truth values of the conditions at each inner node (either `1` for True or `0` for False).

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "Group": 1,
    "Sex": 0,
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 70,
    "BMI_FP": 24.2,
    "Age": 32,
    "Lysholm": 80,
    "IKDC": 85,
    "Tegner": 5,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.5,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 40,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 42,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 35,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -60,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 50,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 200
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output the prediction (`0` or `1`) along with the intermediate decisions made at each node for this specific example.
