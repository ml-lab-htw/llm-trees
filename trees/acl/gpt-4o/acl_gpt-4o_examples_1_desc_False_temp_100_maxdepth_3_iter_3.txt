Here is a decision tree based on the Features and the Target variable `x1` (cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury). The decision tree has a maximum depth of 3, with 3 inner nodes that use some of the important features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["BMI_FP"] >= 25  # Check if BMI indicates overweight or obese
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.2  # Check if baseline cartilage thickness is below a threshold
    nodes[2] = X["Age"] >= 30  # Check if age is 30 or older

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision checks if the BMI (`BMI_FP`) is 25 or greater, which indicates that the individual is either overweight or obese. This is a key factor in determining abnormal cartilage thickness.
2. **Node 1**: If the BMI is high, the next decision checks if the baseline mean cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.2 mm. Lower thickness values may correspond to cartilage thinning, which could be indicative of abnormal conditions post-injury.
3. **Node 2**: If the baseline cartilage thickness is not low, the tree checks if the individual is 30 years or older (`Age`), as age can contribute to degenerative changes in cartilage.

### Summary of Predictions:
- If the individual has a high BMI (≥ 25) and low baseline cartilage thickness (≤ 2.2 mm), the prediction is **abnormal** cartilage thickness change (1).
- If BMI is high but baseline cartilage thickness is not low, then age is used to make the final decision.
- If the individual has a normal BMI (< 25), age is again considered to determine the risk of abnormal cartilage changes.
