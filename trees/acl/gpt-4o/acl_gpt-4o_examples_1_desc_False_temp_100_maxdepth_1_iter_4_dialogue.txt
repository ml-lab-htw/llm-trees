Here's the Python function based on the decision tree structure you requested. The tree is constructed with a maximum depth of 1, using the feature `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur) as the most important feature for the decision split, as discussed earlier.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list for the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None]
    
    # First and only node: check if the baseline mean cartilage thickness is <= 2.25 mm
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.25
    
    # Decision making based on the node evaluation
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 0  # normal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys correspond to the feature names you provided.
- The first node checks whether the baseline mean cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.25 mm.
  - If true, the model predicts an abnormal cartilage thickness change (1).
  - If false, the model predicts a normal cartilage thickness change (0).
- The function returns the prediction along with a list (`nodes`) representing the truth value for the inner node condition (`ccmfthctabame <= 2.25`).

### Usage Example:

```python
X_example = {
    "Group": 1,
    "Sex": 0,
    "Height": 175,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 75,
    "BMI_FP": 24.0,
    "Age": 28,
    "Lysholm": 80,
    "IKDC": 75,
    "Tegner": 4,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.1,  # Baseline cartilage thickness in mm
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 42,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 35,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 30,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -25,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 20,
    "Dominant_Leg": 0,
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 45
}

prediction, node_values = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Node evaluations: {node_values}")
```

In this example, `X_example["ccmfthctabame"] = 2.1`, which is less than 2.25, so the prediction would be `1` (abnormal change), and the node evaluations would be `[True]`.
