### Explanation of the function:
1. **Nodes List**: Each entry in the `nodes` list tracks the truth value of a condition at an internal node of the decision tree. If the condition is satisfied, the value is `1` (True), otherwise, it is `0` (False).
2. **Group**: The first decision is based on the patient's group (coper, noncoper, or surgical reconstruction). If the patient belongs to the **surgical reconstruction** group, we proceed to evaluate their cartilage thickness and knee moment.
3. **Cartilage Thickness**: If the baseline cartilage thickness in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.20 mm, we then evaluate the knee moment.
4. **Knee Moment**: Lower knee moments are associated with abnormal cartilage changes for surgical reconstruction patients.
5. **T2 Deep Cartilage Values & Lysholm Score**: For non-surgical patients (coper or noncoper), the decision is based on baseline T2 values for the deep cartilage layers and Lysholm score, which reflect cartilage integrity and knee function, respectively.

The **function** returns:
- `prediction`: A single prediction of whether the cartilage thickness change is **normal (0)** or **abnormal (1)**.
- `nodes`: A list of truth values for each decision node in the tree. A value of `1` means the condition was satisfied, and `0` means it was not.
