Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 based on the Features and target variable provided:

### Features:
- **Group**: (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
- **Sex**: (0 = female, 1 = male)
- **Height**: height (cm)
- **Body_Mass_FP**: body mass (kg)
- **BMI_FP**: body mass index (kg/mÂ²)
- **Age**: age (years)
- **Lysholm**: Lysholm score
- **IKDC**: IKDC score
- **Tegner**: Tegner score
- **ccmfthctabame**: baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (mm)
- **ccMF.D.T2.Me**: baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms)
- **ccMF.S.T2.Me**: baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms)
- **Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ**: external peak knee moment around x-axis (Nm)
- **Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ**: external peak knee moment around y-axis (Nm)
- **Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ**: external peak knee moment around z-axis (Nm)
- **Dominant_Leg**: dominant leg (0 = left, 1 = right)
- **days_injury_to_MRI**: days from injury to baseline MRI

### Target Variable:
- **x1**: cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)

### Decision Tree:
Given the available features, one of the most important factors likely related to cartilage thickness change after an ACL injury could be the **baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ccMF.D.T2.Me)**. This is because T2 values in MRI are often used to assess cartilage health and degeneration.

Thus, the decision tree will use this feature to decide whether the cartilage thickness change is normal or abnormal:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision based on baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur
    nodes[0] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 45.0  # Example threshold based on T2 values indicating cartilage health
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision is based on whether the **baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ccMF.D.T2.Me)** are less than or equal to 45.0 ms. 
  - If the value is less than or equal to 45.0, the prediction is "0" (normal cartilage thickness change).
  - If the value is greater than 45.0, the prediction is "1" (abnormal cartilage thickness change).
- The `nodes` list contains only one element, which is the boolean result of this condition.

You can adjust the threshold value `45.0` depending on domain-specific knowledge or further analysis.
