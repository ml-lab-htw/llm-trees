Based on the Features and target variable, I will create a decision tree of depth 1. Since the decision tree can have only one inner node, I will choose the most relevant feature for predicting the target based on the descriptions provided.

Given that the target variable is related to cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur, features such as **ccmfthctabame** (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur) might be highly predictive. I'll use this feature to create a simple decision tree with a maximum depth of 1.

Here is the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Inner node: if baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.5 mm
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Feature chosen:** `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur).
- **Threshold:** 2.5 mm (arbitrarily chosen as a reasonable value for the decision).
- **Prediction:**
  - If `ccmfthctabame` is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, predict `1` (abnormal cartilage thickness change).
  - Otherwise, predict `0` (normal cartilage thickness change).

This function returns the prediction and an array `nodes` where:
- `nodes[0]` will be `1` if the condition `ccmfthctabame <= 2.5` is satisfied, otherwise `0`.
