```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Based on the 'Group' feature (0 = coper, 1 = noncoper, 2 = surgical reconstruction)
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 0  # Check if the person is a 'coper'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the person is a 'coper', classify as normal (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If the person is a 'noncoper' or had 'surgical reconstruction', classify as abnormal (1)
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree uses the **"Group"** feature as the root node.
  - If the individual is classified as a **coper** (condition `X["Group"] == 0`), the cartilage thickness change is predicted to be **normal** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If the individual is a **noncoper** (`X["Group"] == 1`) or has undergone **surgical reconstruction** (`X["Group"] == 2`), the cartilage thickness change is predicted to be **abnormal** (`prediction = 1`).
  
- The output includes the predicted class (`0` for normal, `1` for abnormal) and a list (`nodes`) that holds the truth value of the condition in the decision node.
