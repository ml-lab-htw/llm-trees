Here is the decision tree classifier based on the Features and target variable ("x1: cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)"). The tree is built to a depth of 5, using the most important features provided.

    if nodes[0]:  # BMI > 25
        # Node 1: Split on Age
        nodes[1] = X["Age"] > 30  # Split on Age > 30

### **Explanation of the Decision Tree:**

1. **Node 0**: The first split is on the BMI (`BMI_FP`). If the BMI is greater than 25 (overweight or obese), the tree proceeds in one direction; otherwise, it proceeds in the other direction.

2. **Node 1**: 
   - If BMI > 25, we check the Age (`Age`). If the age is > 30, we move further down the tree.
   - If BMI <= 25, we split based on height (`Height`). Taller individuals (> 170 cm) are treated differently than shorter individuals.

3. **Node 2**: 
   - For BMI > 25 and Age > 30, we split based on the Lysholm score (`Lysholm`), which indicates knee function.
   - For BMI <= 25 and Height > 170, we check the deep cartilage T2 value (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`).
   - For BMI > 25 and Age <= 30, we check the superficial cartilage T2 value (`ccMF.S.T2.Me`).

4. **Node 3**: 
   - For BMI > 25, Age > 30, and Lysholm > 80, we examine the knee moment in the x-axis direction (`Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ`).
   
5. **Node 4**: Finally, the prediction is made based on the IKDC score (`IKDC`) for individuals who satisfy the previous conditions.

### **Output:**
- **Prediction**: The prediction is either `0` (normal cartilage thickness change) or `1` (abnormal cartilage thickness change).
- **Nodes**: The `nodes` list contains the truth values (1 = True, 0 = False) for each of the 5 inner nodes evaluated during the prediction process.
