Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 based on the Features and target variable `x1` (cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur). The tree prioritizes the most important features intuitively related to cartilage thickness change. For example, factors like the baseline mean cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) and the baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`) are likely to be significant predictors.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 1: Check if the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.5 mm
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    # Node 2: Check if the baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers are less than or equal to 40 ms
    nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 40

    if nodes[0]:
        # If the baseline cartilage thickness is low, check the deep cartilage T2 values
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        # If the baseline cartilage thickness is higher, predict normal
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1** (`nodes[0]`): The first condition checks whether the baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (`ccmfthctabame`) is less than or equal to 2.5 mm. This feature is likely important because thinner cartilage at baseline may indicate a higher risk of abnormal changes over time.

2. **Node 2** (`nodes[1]`): If the cartilage thickness is low, we further check the T2 values of the deep cartilage layers (`ccMF.D.T2.Me`). A lower T2 value (less than or equal to 40 ms) could indicate poor cartilage health, suggesting an abnormal change in thickness over time.

3. **Predictions**:
   - If both conditions are met (low cartilage thickness and low T2 values), the model predicts an **abnormal cartilage thickness change** (`1`).
   - If the cartilage thickness is higher or the T2 values are higher, the model predicts **normal thickness change** (`0`).

### Example usage:
```python
# Example input data
X = {
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.3,  # baseline mean cartilage thickness in central medial femur
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 39,    # baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers
    # Other features can be ignored since they aren't used in this simple tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Node conditions:", nodes)
```

This decision tree is structured with a depth of 2, and it uses two conditions based on the features you provided. The prediction and the conditions of the inner nodes are returned correctly according to your specifications.
