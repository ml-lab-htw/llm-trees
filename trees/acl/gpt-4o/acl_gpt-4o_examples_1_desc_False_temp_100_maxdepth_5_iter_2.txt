Below is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 for predicting "x1: cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal)" based on the features you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define conditions for each node in the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] > 30              # Age of the individual
    nodes[2] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25           # BMI value (25 is a common threshold for overweight)
    nodes[3] = X["Lysholm"] > 70          # Lysholm score, higher is better (70 is used as a clinical threshold)
    nodes[4] = X["IKDC"] > 50             # IKDC score, higher is better
    
    # Decision-making based on the nodes' truth values
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0 (ccmfthctabame)**: Baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur. If this value is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, the individual is likely at higher risk for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
- **Node 1 (Age)**: Age is a significant factor, and individuals older than 30 years are more likely to exhibit abnormal cartilage thickness changes.
- **Node 2 (BMI_FP)**: A BMI above 25 (overweight threshold) increases the risk of abnormal cartilage thickness changes.
- **Node 3 (Lysholm)**: The Lysholm score is an indicator of knee function, and a score above 70 is generally considered good.
- **Node 4 (IKDC)**: The IKDC score is another knee function score, with higher values indicating better knee function.
