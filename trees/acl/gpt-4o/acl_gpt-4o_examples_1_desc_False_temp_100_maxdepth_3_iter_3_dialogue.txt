    # Node 0: Check if the patient had surgical reconstruction
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 2  # surgical reconstruction is encoded as 2
    if nodes[0]:

    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the baseline T2 values for deep cartilage layers are less than or equal to 45 ms
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] <= 45
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # normal
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the baseline cartilage thickness in the central medial femur is less than or equal to 2.0 mm
            nodes[2] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # abnormal
            else:
                prediction = 0  # normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0**: Checks if the patient belongs to the "surgical reconstruction" group (encoded as `2`). If yes, the prediction is "abnormal" (encoded as `1`).
  
- **Node 1**: If the patient is not in the surgical reconstruction group, the next check is on the baseline **T2 values** for the deep cartilage layers. If the T2 values are less than or equal to 45 ms (a threshold indicating healthier cartilage), the prediction is "normal" (encoded as `0`).
  
- **Node 2**: If the T2 values are higher than 45 ms, the next decision point checks the baseline **cartilage thickness** in the central medial femur. If the thickness is less than or equal to 2.0 mm, the prediction is "abnormal" (encoded as `1`). Otherwise, the prediction is "normal" (encoded as `0`).

This structure adheres to the logic of the decision tree you requested, and the decision points use feature names exactly as provided.
