Here's a decision tree of depth 1 for the Features and the Target variable `x1`:

### Selected Feature:
Since you want a decision tree of depth 1, we need to choose the most important feature. Looking at the provided features, the feature `ccmfthctabame` seems directly related to the target variable (cartilage thickness change), so we will use it as the root of the tree.

### Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Inner node based on baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 1.8  # Arbitrary threshold for normal vs abnormal cartilage thickness change
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # normal
    else:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The feature used in the inner node is `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur).
- The threshold value is set to `1.8` (this is an arbitrary threshold since we're not training on actual data, but it's meant to represent a boundary between normal and abnormal cartilage thickness change).
- If the cartilage thickness is less than or equal to `1.8mm`, the function predicts a normal cartilage thickness change (`0`). Otherwise, it predicts an abnormal cartilage thickness change (`1`).
- The `nodes` array holds the truth value of the condition (`True` or `False`), represented as `1` or `0`.

### Example usage:
```python
X = {
    "ccmfthctabame": 1.5,  # example cartilage thickness
    "sex": 1,  # example other feature
    "age": 28,
    # other features...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code will output:

```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [1]
```

In this case, since the cartilage thickness `1.5` is less than or equal to `1.8`, the prediction is `0` (normal), and the node condition is satisfied (`1` in the nodes list).
