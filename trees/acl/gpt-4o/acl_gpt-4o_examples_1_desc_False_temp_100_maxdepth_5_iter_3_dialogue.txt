### Explanation:

- The function `predict()` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys correspond to the feature names you provided, and the values are the feature values for a specific instance.
- The list `nodes` stores whether each condition (inner node) in the decision tree is satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).
- At each node, we evaluate whether the feature value satisfies the condition, and based on the result, we proceed down the tree or make a prediction.
- The function returns both the prediction (0 = normal, 1 = abnormal) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the conditions.

### Feature Details:

- **IKDC Score**: Threshold of 45 is based on the idea that lower scores (â‰¤ 45) are associated with worse function.
- **Group**: A value of 1 represents "noncoper," which is associated with abnormal outcomes in the decision tree.
- **Lysholm Score**: A threshold of 60 is used to distinguish between different functional recovery levels.
- **External Peak Knee Moment (Z-axis)**: A threshold of 25 Nm is set based on expected biomechanical loads contributing to knee health.
- **Baseline Cartilage Thickness in CMF**: A threshold of 2.5 mm distinguishes between thinner (more vulnerable) and thicker cartilage.
- **Tegner Score**: A threshold of 4 is used to differentiate activity levels.
- **T2 Values for Deep Cartilage Layers**: A threshold of 40 ms is used to indicate cartilage degeneration.
- **Sex**: A value of 1 represents "male," which is associated with better outcomes in some branches.
