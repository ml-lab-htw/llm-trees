### Explanation:
1. **Node 1**: The first decision is based on the patient's group. We check if the patient had **surgical reconstruction** (Group == 2). If so, the decision tree follows down the path for surgical patients.
   
2. **Node 2 (Surgical Reconstruction)**: For individuals who have undergone surgical reconstruction, the next important factor is the **baseline mean cartilage thickness** in the central medial femur. If it's less than or equal to 2.8 mm, the cartilage thickness change is classified as **abnormal** (prediction = 1). If it's greater, the change is classified as **normal** (prediction = 0).

3. **Node 3 (Noncoper)**: If the patient is a **noncoper** (Group == 1), we check the **baseline T2 values for the deep cartilage layers**. Lower values (<= 45 ms) suggest better cartilage integrity, leading to a prediction of **normal**. Higher values indicate more cartilage damage, leading to a prediction of **abnormal**.

4. **Coper Path (Fallback)**: If the patient is a **coper** (Group == 0), the decision is based on the **external peak knee moment around the z-axis**. Lower knee moments (<= 35 Nm) are associated with **normal** cartilage changes, while higher knee moments are associated with **abnormal** changes.

This function returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing whether each internal node condition was satisfied during the decision process.
