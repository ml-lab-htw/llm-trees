Sure! Based on the Features and the target variable you've provided, I'll construct a decision tree of depth 4 using the most important features. The tree will be designed with reasonable thresholds on some of the continuous variables and conditions on categorical variables, without training on actual data.

Hereâ€™s a Python function representing a decision tree classifier for predicting the cartilage thickness change (x1: normal or abnormal) based on the provided features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the subject's IKDC score is less than or equal to 60
    nodes[0] = X["IKDC"] <= 60  # IKDC score is a common knee assessment score, lower scores could indicate more severe injury
    
    if nodes[0]:  # IKDC <= 60
        # Node 1: Check if the baseline T2 values for deep cartilage layers are higher than 40 ms
        nodes[1] = X["ccMF.D.T2.Me"] > 40  # Higher T2 values in deep layers could indicate abnormal cartilage composition
        
        if nodes[1]:  # ccMF.D.T2.Me > 40
            # Node 2: Check if the subject's BMI is greater than 25 (overweight)
            nodes[2] = X["BMI_FP"] > 25  # Higher BMI is a known risk factor for cartilage degeneration
            
            if nodes[2]:  # BMI_FP > 25
                # Node 3: Check if the subject is a "noncoper" (group == 1)
                nodes[3] = X["Group"] == 1  # Noncopers typically have worse functional outcomes without surgery
                
                if nodes[3]:  # Group == 1 (noncoper)
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
                else:  # Group != 1 (not noncoper)
                    prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
            else:  # BMI_FP <= 25
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:  # ccMF.D.T2.Me <= 40
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    else:  # IKDC > 60
        # Node 1: Check if the external peak knee moment around the z-axis is greater than 30 Nm
        nodes[1] = X["Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ"] > 30  # Higher knee moments might correspond to abnormal strain on the knee
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Knee Moment Z > 30
            # Node 2: Check if days from injury to MRI is greater than 90 days
            nodes[2] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] > 90  # Delayed MRI might indicate chronic injuries
            
            if nodes[2]:  # days_injury_to_MRI > 90
                # Node 3: Check if the subject's Lysholm score is less than or equal to 60
                nodes[3] = X["Lysholm"] <= 60  # Lower Lysholm scores indicate worse knee function
                
                if nodes[3]:  # Lysholm <= 60
                    prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
                else:  # Lysholm > 60
                    prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
            else:  # days_injury_to_MRI <= 90
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:  # Knee Moment Z <= 30
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0: IKDC score** - This is a commonly used score for knee function, and lower IKDC scores could indicate more severe knee problems.
   
2. **Node 1: T2 values for deep cartilage layers (ccMF.D.T2.Me)** - T2 values are often used in MRI imaging to assess cartilage health, and higher values could indicate abnormal cartilage composition.

3. **Node 2: BMI** - Higher BMI values (>25) are associated with greater stress on the knee joint and potentially worse outcomes after injury.

4. **Node 3: Group (noncoper)** - Non-copers typically have worse outcomes without surgical intervention, so being in this group could indicate abnormal cartilage changes.

When the IKDC score is >60 (i.e., better knee function), the model checks alternative factors, such as the external knee moment and the time from injury to MRI (chronicity of the injury), to make a prediction.

### Output:

- The function returns two items:
  1. **Prediction**: `0` for normal cartilage thickness change and `1` for abnormal cartilage thickness change.
  2. **Nodes**: A list of truth values (0 or 1) representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied or not.
