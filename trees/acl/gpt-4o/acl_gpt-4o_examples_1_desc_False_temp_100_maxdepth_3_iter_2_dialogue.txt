### Explanation of the function:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` where the keys correspond to the feature names you provided.
- The list `nodes` keeps track of whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`1` for True, `0` for False).
- The decision tree follows the structure described earlier:
    - First, it checks if the person has undergone **surgical reconstruction** (Group == 2).
    - If they have, the next check is the **baseline cartilage thickness**. If it's ≤ 2.0 mm, the classification is **abnormal** (1), otherwise it's **normal** (0).
    - If the person is a **coper** or **noncoper** (Group != 2), the decision is based on the **external peak knee moment around the z-axis**. If the moment is ≤ 20 Nm, the function further checks the **T2 values for the deep cartilage layers**. If T2 is ≤ 40 ms, the classification is **normal** (0), otherwise **abnormal** (1).
    - If the knee moment is > 20 Nm, the **age** is checked. If the person is ≤ 30 years old, the classification is **normal** (0), otherwise **abnormal** (1).
