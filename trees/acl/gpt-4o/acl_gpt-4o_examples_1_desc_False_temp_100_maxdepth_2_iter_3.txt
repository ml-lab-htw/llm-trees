Here's a decision tree based on the Features you provided. The goal is to predict whether there is an abnormal change in cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (`x1` target variable).

### Decision Tree:

Based on the features, we can hypothesize that factors such as the group status (noncoper, surgical reconstruction, etc.), BMI, and the time from injury to MRI could be important for cartilage thickness change.

### Python Function with Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Group status seems highly relevant for cartilage change.
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 1  # Noncoper
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: If noncoper, days from injury to MRI might be important.
        nodes[1] = X["days_injury_to_MRI"] <= 90
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # More likely to have abnormal cartilage change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Less likely to have abnormal cartilage change
    else:
        # Node 2: For other groups, BMI might be an indicator of cartilage change.
        nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] >= 25  # Overweight or Obese
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # More likely to have abnormal cartilage change
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Less likely to have abnormal cartilage change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Root Node (nodes[0])**: We first check if the individual belongs to the "noncoper" group (`Group == 1`). Noncopers are typically more susceptible to abnormal changes post-injury.
  
- **Left Branch (if noncoper)**: If the individual is a noncoper, we check the time between injury and the MRI scan (`days_injury_to_MRI`). If it's less than or equal to 90 days, there's a higher chance of an abnormal cartilage change because early intervention may not have occurred yet.

- **Right Branch (if not a noncoper)**: For individuals in the "coper" or "surgical reconstruction" groups, we check their BMI. A higher BMI (â‰¥ 25) may increase the risk of abnormal cartilage changes due to added stress on the knee joint.

### Example of Usage:

```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "Group": 1,  # Noncoper
    "Sex": 0,  # Female
    "Height": 170,
    "Body_Mass_FP": 70,
    "BMI_FP": 24.2,
    "Age": 29,
    "Lysholm": 85,
    "IKDC": 75,
    "Tegner": 5,
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.5,
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 50,
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 40,
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 20,
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": 15,
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 30,
    "Dominant_Leg": 1,  # Right
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 60
}

# Predict outcome
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example:
- The prediction will be `1` (abnormal cartilage change) because the individual is a noncoper (`Group == 1`) and the number of days from injury to MRI is less than 90.
