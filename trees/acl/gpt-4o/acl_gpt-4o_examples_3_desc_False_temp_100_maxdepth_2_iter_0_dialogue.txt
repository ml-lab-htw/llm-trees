Based on the decision tree constructed earlier and your requirements, here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier. It includes the prediction logic and tracks whether the conditions at each inner node were satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Define the splits based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Group"] == 1  # Group == noncoper (1)
    nodes[1] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5  # Baseline cartilage thickness ≤ 2.5 (mm)
    
    # Start decision-making
    if nodes[0]:  # If Group is noncoper
        if nodes[1]:  # If baseline cartilage thickness ≤ 2.5
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:  # If baseline cartilage thickness > 2.5
            prediction = 0  # Normal
    else:  # If Group is not noncoper
        nodes[1] = X["Lysholm"] <= 80  # Lysholm score ≤ 80
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

### How This Works:

1. **Nodes Tracking:**  
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the patient belongs to the "noncoper" group (`Group == 1`).
   - `nodes[1]` serves as the second decision-making condition:
       - For noncopers, it checks if the baseline cartilage thickness (`ccmfthctabame`) is ≤ 2.5 mm.  
       - For others (copers or surgical reconstruction), it checks if the Lysholm score is ≤ 80.

   The result is a list of booleans (`nodes`), where `1` means the condition at that node was satisfied, and `0` means it was not.

2. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - Root-level decision (node 0): Classifies based on the `Group` feature.
   - Second-level decisions (node 1): Uses features (`ccmfthctabame` for noncopers, `Lysholm` score for others) to finalize the classification.

3. **Prediction:**
   - `0`: Normal cartilage thickness change (target variable `x1 == 0`).
   - `1`: Abnormal cartilage thickness change (target variable `x1 == 1`).

    "days_injury_to_MRI": 200
}

# Make predictions
prediction_1, nodes_1 = predict(example_1)
print("Prediction (Example 1):", prediction_1)  # Should be 1 (Abnormal)
print("Inner Nodes (Example 1):", nodes_1)  # [True, True]

prediction_2, nodes_2 = predict(example_2)
print("Prediction (Example 2):", prediction_2)  # Should be 1 (Abnormal)
print("Inner Nodes (Example 2):", nodes_2)  # [False, True]
```

This function allows you to classify a new set of features and understand the decision-making process at each step (via the `nodes` list). Let me know if you'd like additional refinements!
