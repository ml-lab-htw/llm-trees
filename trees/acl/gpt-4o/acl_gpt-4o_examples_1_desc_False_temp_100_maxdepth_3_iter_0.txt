Here is the requested decision tree classifier based on the Features and target variable `x1` (cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur):

### Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Age <= 30
    nodes[0] = X["Age"] <= 30
    
    # Node 2 (if age > 30): BMI_FP <= 25
    nodes[1] = X["BMI_FP"] <= 25
    
    # Node 3 (if age > 30 and BMI_FP > 25): Lysholm <= 80
    nodes[2] = X["Lysholm"] <= 80
    
    # Decision based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Abnormal cartilage thickness change
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Normal cartilage thickness change

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
1. **Node 1:** The first decision is based on the individual's age. If the individual is 30 years old or younger, the model predicts an **abnormal cartilage thickness change** (prediction = 1).
   
2. **Node 2:** If the individual is older than 30, the next decision is based on their BMI (Body Mass Index). If their BMI is 25 or less, the model predicts a **normal cartilage thickness change** (prediction = 0).

3. **Node 3:** If the individual is older than 30 and has a BMI greater than 25, the final decision is based on their **Lysholm score**. If the Lysholm score is less than or equal to 80, the model predicts an **abnormal cartilage thickness change** (prediction = 1). Otherwise, it predicts a **normal cartilage thickness change** (prediction = 0).

### Example of usage:
```python
# Example feature dictionary for input
X = {
    "Group": 1, 
    "Sex": 1, 
    "Height": 175, 
    "Body_Mass_FP": 80, 
    "BMI_FP": 26, 
    "Age": 32, 
    "Lysholm": 75, 
    "IKDC": 85, 
    "Tegner": 4, 
    "ccmfthctabame": 2.5, 
    "ccMF.D.T2.Me": 30, 
    "ccMF.S.T2.Me": 40, 
    "Knee_Moment_X_Max_0_50_INJ": 50, 
    "Knee_Moment_Y_Min_51_100_INJ": -30, 
    "Knee_Moment_Z_Max_0_50_INJ": 15, 
    "Dominant_Leg": 1, 
    "days_injury_to_MRI": 100
}

# Predicting with the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the decision tree will traverse through the conditions and output a prediction (`0` for normal or `1` for abnormal cartilage thickness change) based on the given input features, along with the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
