Given the Features and the target variable, we will generate a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, using a single inner node based on the most important feature. In this case, we will use the feature `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur) as the decision boundary, as this feature is closely related to the prediction target (`x1`, which measures cartilage thickness change).

The decision rule will be based on the value of `ccmfthctabame`. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that a threshold of 2.5 mm will be used as the cutoff point. If the baseline mean cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, we predict `abnormal` (1), otherwise, we predict `normal` (0).

Here is the decision tree in Python:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Inner node decision: is the baseline mean cartilage thickness <= 2.5 mm?
    nodes[0] = X["ccmfthctabame"] <= 2.5
    
    # Prediction based on the result of the inner node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # abnormal
    else:
        prediction = 0  # normal
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree uses `ccmfthctabame` (baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur), which is a logical feature to assess cartilage thickness change.
- The threshold is set at 2.5 mm. If the cartilage thickness is less than or equal to 2.5 mm, the model predicts `abnormal` (1). Otherwise, it predicts `normal` (0).
- The `nodes` list returns the truth value of the inner node (0 or 1 depending on whether the condition is satisfied).

This is a simple decision tree with a depth of 1, as requested, making a single decision based on the most relevant feature for this problem.
