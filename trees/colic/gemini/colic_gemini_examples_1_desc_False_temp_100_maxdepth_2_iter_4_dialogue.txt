```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # Mild pain or less
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] <= 60

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical (Possibly re-evaluate - kept for consistency with the original tree structure)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations (repeated from previous response):**

* **Simplified and Hypothetical:** This function represents a simplified, hypothetical decision tree. It's *not* a substitute for veterinary diagnosis.
* **No Data Used:**  This function doesn't learn from data. Its logic is based on general domain knowledge (which is insufficient for accurate real-world colic diagnosis).
* **Pain and Pulse Encodings:**  The code assumes the provided encoding for "pain" (1-5, where 4 and below represent mild or less pain) and uses the raw pulse rate in beats per minute.
* **Re-evaluation Case:**  The branch where pain is high but the pulse is low (<= 60 bpm) is classified as non-surgical for consistency with the requested tree structure, but in reality, such cases might warrant further evaluation.  A real decision tree would likely use additional features to make this distinction.
* **Need for Data and Veterinary Expertise:** To create a reliable colic diagnostic tool, a large dataset of cases and collaboration with veterinary experts are essential.


This function fulfills the request to translate the hypothetical decision tree into a Python function with the specified format, but it's crucial to understand its limitations and the importance of data and expert knowledge in developing a real-world diagnostic tool.
