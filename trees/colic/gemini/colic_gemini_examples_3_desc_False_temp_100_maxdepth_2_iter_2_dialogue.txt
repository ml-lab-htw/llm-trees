def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain - using 'severe' pain encoding (value 2) 
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2 
    
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension - using 'severe' distension (value 3)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3 
    
    # Node 2: Placeholder - Needs a meaningful feature for surgical colic
    # Example: High pulse as a possible indicator
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80  # Threshold needs veterinary validation

    if nodes[0]:  # Severe Pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe Abdominal Distension
            prediction = 1  # High Likelihood of Surgical Colic
        else: 
            if nodes[2]:
              prediction = 1 # Consider Surgical
            else:
              prediction = 0 # Consider Medical
    else:         # Non-Severe Pain
        prediction = 0  # More likely Medical, but requires further evaluation 

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict(X)` function takes a dictionary `X` representing a horse's features. It returns the predicted class (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the decision nodes.

2. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if "pain" is equal to 2 (severe pain encoding).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if "abdominal_distension" is equal to 3 (severe distension encoding).
   - `nodes[2]`:  This node is a **placeholder**. You'll need to replace `X["pulse"] > 80` with a more meaningful condition and threshold based on veterinary knowledge or data analysis. 

3. **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree's logic:
    - If both severe pain and severe abdominal distension are present, it predicts surgical colic.
    - If severe pain is present but not severe distension, the placeholder node is evaluated. 

**Important:**

* **Placeholder Node:** Node 2 (`nodes[2]`) needs to be replaced with a clinically relevant feature and threshold. Research or consultation with equine veterinarians is crucial for this. 
* **Thresholds:** The threshold of 80 for the pulse is just an example.  You'll need to determine appropriate thresholds based on veterinary expertise or data.
* **Simplification:** This depth-2 tree is a simplification. Real colic diagnosis is more complex and often involves more features.

**To use the function:**

```python
horse_data = {
    "surgery": 2, 
    "Age": 1,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 90,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "temp_extremities": 1, 
    "peripheral_pulse": 4,
    "mucous_membranes": 3,
    "capillary_refill_time": 0,
    "pain": 2,
    "peristalsis": 1,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": None,
    "rectal_examination": 1,
    "abdomen": 1,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 7.8, 
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2, 
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.5,
    "outcome": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(horse_data)

print("Prediction (0=No Surgery, 1=Surgery):", prediction)
print("Decision Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```
