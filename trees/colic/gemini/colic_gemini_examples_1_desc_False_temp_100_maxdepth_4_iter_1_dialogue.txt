Key Changes and Explanations:

* **Encoding Adjustments:** The provided feature encodings are incorporated into the tree logic, specifically for pain, distension and reflux. The original simplified terms ('mild', 'severe', etc.) are now derived from the numeric values.
* **Thresholds:**  Reasonable threshold values are included for pulse and rectal temperature (as in the previous example), now based on input features.
* **Missing Values**: The code handles some potential "missing" data scenarios (e.g., for nasogastric reflux and capillary refill time).  In a real application, more robust handling of missing data would be essential.
* **Simplified Branches:** To maintain a depth of 4, some branches of the original hypothetical tree have been condensed.  This is a trade-off between complexity and interpretability. More complex trees (higher depth) are possible but harder to interpret.



This function provides a basic structure.  A true, functional model would require training on a dataset to determine optimal splits and feature importance.  This implementation provides a conceptual framework for translating a decision tree into Python code using the given feature encodings.
