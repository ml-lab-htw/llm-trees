**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoded Values:** Uses the provided feature encodings.
* **Realistic Thresholds:** Includes more realistic thresholds for pulse and temperature based on general equine knowledge (but still subject to veterinary confirmation).
* **Abdominal Distension Handling:** Simplified handling of abdominal distension - any level of distension in combination with other factors is considered potentially surgical.
* **Mucous Membrane Simplification:**  Groups pale pink and pale cyanotic as indicators for potential concern.
* **Truth Value Tracking:** The `nodes` list accurately tracks the truth values of the decision nodes.

This improved version addresses the previous limitations by using the correct encodings and incorporating somewhat more sensible thresholds.  However, the same caveats apply: **this is not a substitute for veterinary diagnosis!**  A real-world diagnostic model would require training on a large dataset and careful evaluation.
