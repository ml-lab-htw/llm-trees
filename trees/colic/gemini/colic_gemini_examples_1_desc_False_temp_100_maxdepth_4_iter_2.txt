This generated code uses the provided features to create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 (and up to 15 inner nodes).  It favors features that seem likely to be related to surgery decisions for colic in horses. It addresses issues from the previous version:



* **Feature Relevance:** Features are chosen with an attempt to be logically related to equine colic and surgical decisions.  For example, elevated pulse, temperature, severe pain, high packed cell volume, distended abdomen, abnormal mucous membrane color, etc., are all potential indicators for surgical intervention.
* **Depth and Nodes:**  The tree structure ensures a maximum depth of 4 while utilizing up to 15 inner nodes.
* **Pythonic Conditions:**  The `in` operator is used for checking membership in lists (e.g., for pain and mucous membrane conditions), making the code more concise and readable.


**Important:**  This code is *synthetic*.  It has *not* been trained on real horse colic data.  The choices of features and thresholds are purely demonstrative.  To create a useful model, you would need to train a decision tree on a labeled dataset using a library like scikit-learn.
