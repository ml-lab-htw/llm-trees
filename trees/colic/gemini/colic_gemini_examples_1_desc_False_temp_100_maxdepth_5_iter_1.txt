The decision tree logic is constructed based on intuitive relationships between the features and whether or not surgery is needed for colic in a horse.   Features like high pulse, high temperature, severe pain, abdominal distension, and of course, the "surgery" feature itself are used to make the decision. This is a synthetic tree, not trained on real data, so its accuracy on real horse colic cases is unknown.  The structure ensures a maximum depth of 5, and the nodes list is returned with 1s and 0s as requested.
