**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:** The code now directly uses the encoding provided for the features (e.g., pain levels, distension levels, etc.).
* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable placeholder thresholds (e.g., pulse > 80 bpm) where necessary.  These are educated guesses and *must* be refined with real data.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree is a bit simplified compared to the original outline to make the code cleaner and manageable, but it captures the core logic.
* **Further Investigation:** The function doesn't explicitly handle cases where further investigation is needed. In a real-world application, you'd likely add flags or additional logic for such scenarios.
* **Error Handling:**  No explicit error handling is included (e.g., missing values).  You'd want to add that in a production system.


**To use the function:**

```python
example_horse = {
    'surgery': 2, 'Age': 0, 'rectal_temperature': 38.5, 'pulse': 100, 'respiratory_rate': 24, 
    'temp_extremities': 2, 'peripheral_pulse': 4, 'mucous_membranes': 6, 'capillary_refill_time': 0, 
    'pain': 5, 'peristalsis': 3, 'abdominal_distension': 3, 'nasogastric_tube': 2, 
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0, 'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 6.5, 'rectal_examination': 2, 
    'abdomen': 1, 'packed_cell_volume': 45, 'total_protein': 7.0, 
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 3, 'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 3.5, 'outcome': 1
}


prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction (0=No Surgery, 1=Surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")


```

Remember, this function is based on a hypothetical tree.  Training on a real dataset is essential for a reliable and accurate prediction model.
