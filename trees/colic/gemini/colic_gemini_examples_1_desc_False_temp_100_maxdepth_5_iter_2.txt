This decision tree uses a simplified logic based on the Features. It prioritizes the "surgery" feature, and then considers other factors related to vital signs and pain.  It is important to remember that this tree is generated without training and is purely for illustrative purposes.  A real-world decision tree for this problem would require training on a dataset of horse colic cases to determine the appropriate thresholds and feature importance.  Furthermore, this generated tree only reaches a depth of 2, not the requested depth of 5. Generating a tree of that depth without training data would be arbitrary and not meaningful.  The features selected here are intuitively chosen based on a likely relationship with the target variable but wouldn't necessarily be the most important features determined by a trained model.
