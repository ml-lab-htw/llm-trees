```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pulse"] <= 88  # Example threshold, replace with meaningful one
    nodes[1] = X["rectal_temperature"] <= 38.5 # Example threshold, replace with meaningful one

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  #  Example prediction
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Example prediction
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Example prediction

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification:**

1. **Feature Selection (Pulse and Rectal Temperature):**  For a hypothetical colic surgery prediction, pulse and rectal temperature seem like reasonable starting features.  A high pulse might indicate distress, and an abnormal temperature could be a sign of infection or inflammation, both potentially suggesting the need for surgery. These are just initial guesses, and in a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined through data analysis and/or domain expertise.

2. **Thresholds (88 for Pulse, 38.5 for Rectal Temperature):**  The thresholds are placeholders.  In a real application, you would analyze the data distribution to choose appropriate thresholds that maximize the information gain at each split. For example, you might find that horses with a pulse over a certain value are significantly more likely to require surgery.  

3. **Depth 2:** The decision tree is structured to have a maximum depth of 2, meaning there are at most two levels of decision nodes.  This was a requirement of the prompt.  It ensures a simple, interpretable tree, though it might sacrifice some accuracy compared to a deeper tree.

4. **Prediction Values (0 and 1):** The predictions (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery) at the leaf nodes are also placeholders. The values would be determined by the majority class in the respective subsets of the training data that reach each leaf.  Since we are not using training data here, we simply illustrate with example values.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This solution creates a decision tree structure *without using any training data*.  The feature choices, thresholds, and predictions are therefore arbitrary and unlikely to be accurate on real-world data.
* **Real-World Application:** In a real application, you would use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those found in scikit-learn) on a labeled dataset to build a model. The algorithm would learn the best features, thresholds, and predictions based on the data.  
* **Feature Engineering:** You might also consider engineering Features (e.g., interactions between existing features) to improve model performance.
* **Evaluation:** You would evaluate the performance of your decision tree on a held-out test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.


This solution fulfills the prompt's requirements: it creates a Python function representing a depth-2 decision tree based on specified features, returns a prediction, and provides a list indicating the truth values of the inner nodes. Remember that without actual data and training, this tree's predictive power is purely illustrative.
