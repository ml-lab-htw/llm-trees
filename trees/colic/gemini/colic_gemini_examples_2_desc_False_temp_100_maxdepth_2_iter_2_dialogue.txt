**Explanation and IMPORTANT NOTES:**

* **Placeholders:**  The thresholds (>= 3) are GUESSES. You MUST replace these with values learned from your data. This is where feature importance and splitting criteria matter.
* **Feature Encoding:** I've assumed the encoding you provided is consistent. Any errors here will cascade.
* **Missing Values:**  Real-world data has missing entries! You need to handle this during both training and prediction. The function currently assumes complete data.
* **Depth = 2 Fixed:** This function implements your requested depth. A different depth needs code adjustments.
* **Example Is Simplified:**  It does NOT represent a well-trained model, just the structure of your request.

**To make this usable:**

1. **Train a real decision tree:** Using your dataset and a library like scikit-learn. This will give you the best features AND thresholds for each split.
2. **Extract the logic:**  Once trained, you can see the tree's structure and thresholds.
3. **Replace placeholders:** In the `predict` function, put the REAL conditions and values learned from step 2.

This turns the template into an actual predictor based on your data.
