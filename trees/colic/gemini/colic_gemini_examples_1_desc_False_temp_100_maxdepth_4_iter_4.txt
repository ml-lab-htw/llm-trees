Explanation of the generated decision tree logic:

The decision tree is structured to address the target variable (whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery) based on provided features.  The logic attempts to capture plausible relationships, prioritizing features that might suggest a need for surgery. It isn't trained on real data so its accuracy can't be guaranteed.  Here's a breakdown of the branching logic:



* **Pulse:**  High pulse rate can indicate distress, potentially requiring surgery.
* **Rectal Temperature:** Elevated temperature suggests infection/inflammation.
* **Packed Cell Volume:** High PCV can suggest dehydration or other complications.
* **Pain:** Continuous severe pain is a strong indicator for surgical intervention.
* **Mucous Membranes:** Cyanotic membranes (blueish tint) point to circulatory problems.
* **Peripheral Pulse:** Absent pulse is a critical sign.
* **Abdomen:**  A distended large abdomen could indicate serious blockage.
* **Total Protein:** Abnormal protein levels can suggest systemic issues.
* **Age:**  Young horses might be more vulnerable and require surgery.
* **Respiratory Rate:** Elevated respiratory rate indicates distress.



The `if/else` structure follows the branches of the decision tree, leading to a final prediction (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery) based on the feature values. The returned `nodes` list records the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.  This allows for interpretability by showing which conditions were met or not met during the prediction process.
