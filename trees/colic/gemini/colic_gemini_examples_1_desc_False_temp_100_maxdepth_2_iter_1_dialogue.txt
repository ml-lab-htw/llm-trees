```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [4, 1]  # Mild pain or alert (less likely to need surgery)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] <= 80     # Pulse below threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:  # Moderate/Severe pain
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery (Severe pain, low pulse)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery (Severe pain, high pulse)

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Encoding of `pain`:**  The provided description indicates "Degree of Pain" has multiple values (1=alert, 2=continuous severe pain, etc.).  The decision tree logic assumes that 1 (alert) and 4 (intermittent mild pain) are combined to represent situations less likely to require surgery.  This is a simplification and may need adjustment based on veterinary expertise.
* **Threshold for `pulse`:**  80 bpm is used as an example threshold.  This value would ideally be determined from data analysis.
* **No Training:** As requested, the function does not involve any training. It implements the simplified decision tree logic described earlier.
* **Clinical Validity:**  This function is for illustrative purposes only. It's crucial to consult with veterinary professionals to validate the decision logic and ensure its suitability for any real-world application.
* **Error Handling:** This function doesn't include error handling (e.g., for missing or invalid data).  A production-ready function would need to incorporate such checks.


This revised response addresses the prompt's requirements by providing the Python function, using specified feature names, and returning the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. It also includes important caveats about the simplifications and limitations.
