**Explanation and Justification:**

The generated decision tree is a **demonstration** of how a decision tree with a depth of 4 (and up to 15 inner nodes) could be structured using the provided features.  It's crucial to understand that this tree is **not trained** and the choices of features and thresholds are **arbitrary** but somewhat reasonable.  

Here's a breakdown of the design choices:


* **Feature Selection (Arbitrary but Guided by Domain Knowledge where possible):**  I've tried to select features that might be relevant to whether a horse colic case requires surgery. For instance, vital signs like pulse, rectal temperature, packed cell volume, and respiratory rate are likely indicators.  The degree of pain, mucous membrane appearance, and abdominal distension could also be informative.
* **Thresholds (Arbitrary):**  The thresholds used in the conditions (e.g., `pulse > 80`, `rectal_temperature > 38.5`) are completely arbitrary. In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be learned from training data.
* **Tree Structure (Arbitrary):** The branching structure of the tree is also arbitrary. The aim was to create a tree of depth 4 with a path that utilizes at most 15 inner nodes.
* **Predictions (Arbitrary):** The predictions (0 or 1 for surgery or no surgery) at the leaf nodes are also arbitrary.  A trained model would learn these predictions based on the patterns in the data.

**To use this function:**

You would provide a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a horse, and the function would return the predicted outcome (0 or 1) and a list of 15 Boolean values (representing the truth values at
