```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["peristalsis"] in [1, 3]  # 1: absent, 3: hypomotile

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgery (yes)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # surgery (no)

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function directly implements the decision tree based on peristalsis. `nodes[0]` stores the boolean value of the condition (peristalsis being absent or hypomotile).  The prediction is then made based on this single condition. This adheres to the depth-1 constraint and uses the provided feature names and encodings. Remember, this is a simplified model for demonstration purposes.
