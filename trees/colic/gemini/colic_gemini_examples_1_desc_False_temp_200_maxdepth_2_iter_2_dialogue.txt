**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Encoding of `pain`:**  The `pain` feature is encoded with values representing different levels of pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain).  The tree uses `X["pain"] >= 4`  to check for moderate or severe pain, grouping intermittent mild pain and below as not needing surgery in this simplified model. In a real model, a different split might be learned.
2. **Encoding of `abdominal_distension`:** Similarly,  `abdominal_distension` (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight) is handled with  `X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3` to check for moderate/severe distension.
3. **Thresholds:** The thresholds (4 for `pain` and 3 for `abdominal_distension`) are chosen based on reasonable interpretations of the feature encodings. A real decision tree algorithm would learn these thresholds from data.
4. **Depth 2:** The function strictly adheres to a depth-2 tree structure.


**Using the Function:**

```python
example_horse = {
    'surgery': 2,  # yes - Not used in prediction but part of the example data
    'Age': 1,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 60,
    'respiratory_rate': 12,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 5,       # Intermittent Severe Pain
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 1, # Moderate distension
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 45,
    'total_protein': 6.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'outcome': 3 #lived - Not used for prediction
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")       # Output: Nodes: [True, False]


example_horse2 = { # Example where surgery is not predicted
    # ... (other features)
    'pain': 3, # Depressed (mild pain)
    'abdominal_distension': 2, # None
    # ... (rest of features)
}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```



This improved function provides a more realistic (though still simplified) prediction and demonstrates how to handle feature encodings and thresholds within a depth-2 decision tree structure.  Remember that a real-world application would require training on a dataset.  This is a pedagogical example.
