**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Pain Mapping:** The original prompt's pain mapping was a bit unclear.  This version directly uses the provided pain scale (1=alert, 2=continuous severe pain, etc.) where values > 4 represent significant pain likely associated with surgical cases.
* **Distension Mapping:**  The code directly uses the `abdominal_distension` categories (1=moderate, 2=none, 3=severe, 4=slight) to check for severe distension (`== 3`).
* **Reflux Mapping:**  The `nasogastric_reflux` encoding (0=more than 1 liter, 1=less than 1 liter, etc.) is used directly to identify significant reflux (`== 0`).
* **Pulse Threshold:** A pulse > 100 bpm is still used as an indicator for potential surgery in cases without other strong indicators.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The `if/else` structure is revised for better readability and to more closely match the intended decision logic.
* **Node Truth Values:**  The `nodes` list now correctly stores the boolean (True/False) results of each decision node.  These will be converted to 1/0 when the function returns.





This improved function provides a clearer and more accurate representation of the intended decision tree logic, utilizing the provided feature encodings effectively.  Remember that this is still a simplified example, and a true data-driven model would be much more robust.
