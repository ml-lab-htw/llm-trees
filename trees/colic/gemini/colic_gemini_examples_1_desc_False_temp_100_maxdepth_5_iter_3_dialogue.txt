**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Realistic Thresholds:** I've incorporated more realistic thresholds based on veterinary knowledge (e.g., pulse, temperature, pain levels). These are still examples; true thresholds would come from data analysis.
* **Depth Management:** The tree now respects the maximum depth of 5.
* **Clearer Structure:** The nested `if/else` structure makes the logic easier to follow.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the feature encodings you provided.
* **Unused Nodes:**  The code initializes a list of 7 `None` values but only uses a subset based on the tree's branching. Returning `nodes[:7]` ensures only the relevant nodes are returned.

This function represents a *demonstration* of a decision tree structure. To make this a functional diagnostic tool, you *must* train it on real horse colic data.  The structure and thresholds would likely change significantly after training.  Provide a dataset, and I can help you build a data-driven decision tree using scikit-learn or other machine learning libraries.
