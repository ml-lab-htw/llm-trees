def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts if a horse colic case is surgical based on provided features.

    This decision tree prioritizes 'pulse' and 'packed_cell_volume' 
    as key features for a depth-2 tree.  Thresholds are chosen 
    based on general veterinary knowledge, but real-world data 
    is crucial for accurate thresholds.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of horse colic features.
            Keys MUST match provided list exactly (case-sensitive).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical
            nodes (list): Truth values (0/1) of inner nodes' conditions

**Explanation and Assumptions:**

* **Depth 2:** The tree makes a prediction using only two decisions.
* **Feature Selection:** 
    * **Pulse:** A high pulse rate is a strong indicator of pain and potential circulatory compromise in colic, making it a good top-level split.
    * **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):**  A high PCV can suggest dehydration, which often accompanies severe colic requiring surgery. 
* **Thresholds:** The chosen thresholds (80 bpm for pulse, 45% for PCV) are educated guesses based on general equine medicine.  **Real-world data analysis is essential to determine optimal thresholds for your specific dataset.**
* **Simplification:** A depth-2 tree is very limited. In reality, colic surgery decisions are complex and involve many factors.  This tree is a simplified example.

**Important Notes:**

* This function relies on the feature names being exactly as provided (case-sensitive).
* The chosen features and thresholds are illustrative and may not be suitable for all situations. You should analyze your data and consult with veterinary professionals to determine the best features and thresholds for your model.
* Never use this simplified model to make real-life decisions about horse colic treatment.  **Always consult a veterinarian for any health concerns with your horse.**
