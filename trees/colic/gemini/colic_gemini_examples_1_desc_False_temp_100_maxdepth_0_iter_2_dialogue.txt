**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding Alignment:** The function now uses the provided encoding for features like `capillary_refill_time`, `abdominocentesis_appearance`, `rectal_examination`, etc.
* **Threshold Adjustments:**  Reasonable thresholds have been added based on veterinary knowledge (e.g., pulse > 100 bpm).  These are still estimates and would need to be refined with real data.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The logic has been simplified a bit while still trying to capture the essential decision points.
* **Node Tracking:** The `nodes` list now correctly tracks the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
* **Output:** The function returns `2` for surgery (yes) and `1` for no surgery, aligning with the specified encoding. It also returns the `nodes` list as requested.

**Important Reminders:**

* This function represents a *hypothetical* decision tree.  Its accuracy is unknown without training on real horse colic data.
* The chosen thresholds are estimates.  Real-world thresholds would be determined by a decision tree learning algorithm based on a training dataset.
* Feature importance and branching order would also be determined from the data during training.


This improved function should be closer to what you're looking for. Provide a dataset, and I can help you create a real, data-driven decision tree using a machine learning library.
