def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Using pain levels for initial split, mapping to original scale (1=alert, not necessarily no pain)
    # Assuming 2 & 5 (continuous/intermittent severe pain) indicate likely surgery
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  

    # Pulse check if potentially surgical based on pain
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60

    # Capillary refill time if pulse is elevated
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0 # more than 3 seconds

    # Fallback to pain assessment if capillary refill is unknown or missing


    if nodes[0]: # moderate to severe pain
        if nodes[1]: # elevated pulse
            if nodes[2]:  # delayed capillary refill
                prediction = 1 # Surgical - Highly Likely
            else:  # normal capillary refill
                 prediction = 1 # Surgical - Likely 
        else: # normal pulse
            prediction = 0 # Non-Surgical - Requires further investigation (could still be surgical depending on other factors)
    else: # mild or no pain (alert doesn't necessarily mean no pain - requires further investigation)
        prediction = 0 # Non-Surgical


    return prediction, nodes[:3] # Return only the used nodes

**Explanation and Caveats:**

* **Mapping Pain:** The original `pain` feature uses a different scale than described in the initial prompt. I've adapted the logic to use the provided encoding, assuming values 2 and 5 (continuous and intermittent severe pain, respectively) indicate higher likelihood of surgical intervention.  Value 1 (alert) doesn't necessarily mean no pain, so it falls under further investigation.
* **Thresholds:**  The pulse threshold (60 bpm) and capillary refill time (>3 seconds) are based on general veterinary knowledge but can vary depending on the individual horse and circumstances.  These are *not* definitive thresholds.
* **Simplified Logic:** This decision tree still simplifies a complex medical diagnosis. Many other features (e.g., abdominal distension, rectal exam, etc.) would be critical in a real-world assessment.
* **No Data Training:** This tree is not trained on data and therefore its accuracy is unknown. It is purely for illustrative purposes and should *not* be used for real medical decisions.


It's crucial to remember that this is a hypothetical illustration.  A real diagnostic model would require a large, labeled dataset and careful validation by veterinary experts.  Always consult a veterinarian for any concerns about horse health.
