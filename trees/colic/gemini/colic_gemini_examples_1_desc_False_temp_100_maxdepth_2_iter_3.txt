```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45  # Example threshold
    nodes[1] = X["total_protein"] <= 6.5      # Example threshold

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

```

I've created a decision tree function using `packed_cell_volume` and `total_protein` as the splitting features.  These are chosen arbitrarily as examples, as there's no training data to determine actual important features or thresholds.  The tree has a depth of 2 with two inner nodes. The thresholds (45 for packed cell volume and 6.5 for total protein) are also examples.  In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be learned from data.  The tree's logic follows the if/else structure to classify based on these features and their respective thresholds. The function returns both the predicted class (0 or 1) and the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
