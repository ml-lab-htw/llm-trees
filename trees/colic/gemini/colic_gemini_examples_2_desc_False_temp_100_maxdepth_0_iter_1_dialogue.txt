You're asking for a decision tree, but without any data to learn from, I can only give you a *hypothetical* tree structure. This won't be accurate for real colic cases, as the thresholds and feature choices need data to determine.

```python
def predict_colic_surgery(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the need for surgery based on horse colic symptoms.
    WARNING: This is a HYPOTHETICAL example, NOT based on real data.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of horse colic features.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 0 = No surgery, 1 = Surgery
            nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1=True, 0=False)
    """

    nodes = 6 * [None] 

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Severe pain, continuous or intermittent
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 100  # High heart rate
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # Prolonged CRT
    nodes[3] = X["rectal_temperature"] > 38.5  # Fever
    nodes[4] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3] # Moderate or severe distension
    nodes[5] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0 # Large volume reflux

    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:  # High HR and prolonged CRT (poor perfusion)
            prediction = 1
        elif nodes[3] and nodes[4]: # Fever and distension (potential strangulation)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Pain might be manageable without surgery
    else:
        if nodes[5]: # Large volume reflux
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Placeholders Filled:** I've used some veterinary knowledge to set *potential* thresholds. For example, high pulse and prolonged capillary refill time often indicate poor circulation, which is a surgical concern.  
* **Logic:** The tree prioritizes life-threatening signs (pain, circulation). Less severe cases might still need surgery based on other factors.
* **Limitations:**  This is HIGHLY simplified. Real decision support for colic is complex!

**To make this tree meaningful, you NEED real data and a tree-building algorithm (see my previous response).** Once you have those, you can replace the placeholder logic with data-driven splits. 

Feel free to provide the dataset, and I can help you build a more accurate tree using Python!
