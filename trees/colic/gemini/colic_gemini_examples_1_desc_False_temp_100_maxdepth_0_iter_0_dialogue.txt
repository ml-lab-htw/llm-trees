Key improvements:

* **Directly uses feature dictionary keys:**  Ensures correct feature access.
* **Encoded values:**  Uses the provided encodings for features like pain, capillary refill time, etc.
* **Reasonable thresholds:**  Uses medically reasonable threshold values where applicable (e.g., pulse > 100 bpm).
* **Simplified logic where appropriate:**  Groups similar categories together (e.g., mild/alert pain, none/slight distension) to reduce complexity.
* **Handles potentially significant missing data:** In the case of nasogastric reflux, treats "missing" as potentially significant, erring on the side of caution.
* **More detailed "potentially surgical" branches:**  Better reflects the need for further diagnostics in borderline cases.


This function now represents a much more robust (though still hypothetical) decision tree for classifying surgical colic based on the provided features and encodings.  Remember that using real-world data to train a decision tree model is crucial for optimal performance.
