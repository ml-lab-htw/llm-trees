```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # Pain greater than mild/alert (using 2 as a proxy for mild/alert)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60

    if nodes[0]:  # Significant pain
        if nodes[1]: # High pulse
            prediction = 1 # Surgical
        else:       # Normal pulse
            prediction = 0 # Non-surgical (monitor)
    else:          # Mild/no pain
        prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Pain Threshold:** The `pain` feature uses a numerical encoding where higher values seem to represent more severe pain. I've set the threshold at > 2, assuming values less than or equal to 2 represent mild pain or alertness (which aren't strong indicators for surgery).  The exact interpretation would depend on the dataset's encoding.

2. **Pulse Threshold:** A resting pulse over 60 bpm in an adult horse is often considered elevated and could indicate a need for surgical intervention.

3. **Tree Logic:** The logic follows the hypothetical tree structure described previously. Significant pain combined with an elevated pulse suggests a higher probability of surgery.  Mild/no pain generally suggests non-surgical management.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Dependence:** This function is still a simplified example. Real-world decision boundaries are likely more complex and would be learned from data.
* **Threshold Tuning:** The thresholds (2 for pain, 60 for pulse) are educated guesses based on general veterinary knowledge.  Optimal thresholds would be determined through data analysis and model training.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The effectiveness of the function relies heavily on the correct interpretation of the feature encodings. For example, I've assumed the "pain" encoding increases with pain severity.  If the encoding is different, the function would need adjustment.
* **Missing Values:** The current function doesn't handle missing data.  In a real application, you'd need to implement strategies to deal with missing values (imputation, etc.).


To create a truly effective decision tree, you must train it on a real dataset using a decision tree learning algorithm. This allows the algorithm to learn the best features, thresholds, and tree structure from the data itself, resulting in a much more accurate and reliable model.
