def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Moderate/Severe
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Continuous severe pain or Intermittent severe pain

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery (Yes)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Further Evaluation Needed (leaning towards surgery)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Surgery (Likely No) 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The code defines a function `predict(X)` that takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing a single horse's features.

2. **Nodes Initialization:** `nodes = 2 * [None]` creates a list called `nodes` with two elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions checked at each inner node of the decision tree.

3. **Node 0: Abdominal Distension:**
   - `nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]` checks if the horse's "abdominal_distension" is either "moderate" (1) or "severe" (3). 
   - If the condition is true, `nodes[0]` is set to 1 (True); otherwise, it remains `None` (False).

4. **Node 1: Degree of Pain (Conditional):**
   - `nodes[1] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]` is checked **only if** `nodes[0]` is True (meaning abdominal distension is moderate or severe). 
   - This condition checks if the horse is experiencing either "continuous severe pain" (2) or "intermittent severe pain" (5). 
   - If true, `nodes[1]` is set to 1 (True); otherwise, it remains `None` (False).

5. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The `if` and `else` blocks use the values in `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` to make a prediction:
     - **`if nodes[0]:`**  If abdominal distension is moderate/severe, we proceed to check the pain level.
        - **`if nodes[1]:`** If pain is also severe, predict `1` (surgery likely).
        - **`else:`** If pain is not severe, predict `1` (further evaluation needed, but leaning towards surgery).
     - **`else:`** If abdominal distension is not moderate/severe, predict `0` (surgery less likely).

6. **Return Values:** The function returns two values:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).
   - `nodes`: The list containing the truth values of the inner nodes, representing the path taken through the tree.

**Thresholds:**

I've chosen thresholds based on general veterinary knowledge, but you would ideally determine these thresholds from data analysis on a real horse colic dataset.
