This decision tree uses a simplified logic based on the provided features and a hypothetical relationship to the target variable (whether surgery is needed or not). It's crucial to understand that this tree is **not** trained on real data and the logic within it is purely illustrative. The actual relationships between these features and the need for surgery in horses are complex and require proper veterinary diagnosis.  

The tree prioritizes the `surgery` feature, as it seems highly indicative.  Then it considers age, pulse, temperature, and pain level. The conditions and thresholds (e.g., pulse > 80, pain > 3) are arbitrary and would need to be determined through actual data analysis and veterinary expertise in a real-world scenario.  A model trained on actual data would likely have a different structure and different decision boundaries.  This code fulfills the prompt's requirement to create a Python function representing a decision tree of a specified depth, using the given features, without training on data.
