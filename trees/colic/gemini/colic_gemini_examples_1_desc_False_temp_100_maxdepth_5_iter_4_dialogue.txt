**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Realistic Thresholds:** I've used more realistic threshold values based on veterinary knowledge (where possible â€“ some thresholds are still somewhat arbitrary without data).  For example, a pulse > 100 bpm in a horse is often a concern.
* **Depth Limit:** The tree respects the maximum depth of 5.
* **Clearer Structure:** The `if/else` structure is more organized, making the logic easier to follow.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list accurately tracks the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions at each inner node, as requested.
* **Feature Usage:** The tree only uses the specified feature names.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Data:**  This decision tree is *not* trained on data. It's a handcrafted example based on general domain knowledge and the provided feature descriptions.  Its accuracy on real-world data is unknown and likely to be limited.
* **Data-Driven Approach:** To build a truly effective model, you *must* provide a dataset of horse colic cases with the features and the "surgery" outcome. Then, machine learning algorithms can learn the optimal decision boundaries from the data.
* **Feature Encoding:**  Ensure that your data is correctly encoded as described in your feature descriptions (e.g., 1 for "no surgery", 2 for "yes surgery").  The code assumes this encoding.




This improved function provides a more reasonable example, but real-world performance depends entirely on training with actual data. Provide your data, and I can build a data-driven decision tree using scikit-learn, which will be much more reliable.
