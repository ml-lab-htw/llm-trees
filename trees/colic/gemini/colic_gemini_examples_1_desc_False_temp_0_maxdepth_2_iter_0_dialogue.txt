```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Moderate/Severe Pain (using encoding for intermittent and continuous severe pain)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60

    if nodes[0]:  # Moderate/Severe Pain
        if nodes[1]:  # High Pulse
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:  # Normal/Low Pulse
            prediction = 0  # No Surgery (with potential re-evaluation)
    else:  # Mild/No Pain
        prediction = 0  # No Surgery

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Pain Encoding:** The original prompt didn't specify numerical values for pain levels.  This version uses the provided encoding where 2 and 5 represent continuous and intermittent severe pain, respectively, covering the "moderate/severe" branch.  Other pain levels (1, 3, 4) are considered "none/mild."

2. **Pulse Threshold:**  60 bpm is used as a reasonable threshold for an elevated pulse in a horse, especially in the context of pain. This value can be adjusted based on further data analysis or veterinary guidelines.

3. **Clarity:** The code is structured to clearly reflect the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.

4. **No Missing Value Handling:**  This function still doesn't explicitly handle missing values.  In a real-world application, you would need to incorporate checks and imputation strategies for missing data.  For example:

   ```python
   if X["pain"] is None:  # Example: Handling missing pain values
       # Implement a strategy, e.g., imputation with the most frequent value
       # Or assign a default prediction based on other factors
       ...
   ```


This improved function provides a more complete and usable implementation of the simplified horse colic decision tree, while still acknowledging its limitations and the need for further refinement in a real-world scenario.  Remember that this remains a simplified model and shouldn't replace professional veterinary diagnosis.
