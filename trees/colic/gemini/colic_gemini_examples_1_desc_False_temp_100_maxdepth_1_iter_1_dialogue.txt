```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Continuous severe pain or Intermittent severe pain

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```


This function directly implements the decision tree based on the `pain` feature, using the provided encoding.  The `nodes` list holds the truth value (1 or 0) of the single decision node condition.  If the horse has continuous severe pain (2) or intermittent severe pain (5), the condition is True, and the prediction is 1 (surgery). Otherwise, the prediction is 0 (no surgery). This function doesn't require any training as it encodes the simplified logic directly.  Remember that this is a very simplified model.  A real-world colic diagnosis needs to consider many more factors.
