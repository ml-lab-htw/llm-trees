Key improvements:

* **Clearer Thresholds:** Uses the provided feature encodings to establish meaningful thresholds (e.g., for pain and abdominal distension).
* **CRT Integration:**  Incorporates capillary refill time in the severe pain branch, as it's a crucial indicator in such cases.
* **Consistent Logic:**  Ensures that the decision logic flows clearly and aligns with the initial tree structure.
* **Adherence to Prompt:**  Strictly uses the provided feature names and generates a function without training.





This function is still a simplified model.  A real-world application would require data-driven training and validation.  However, this improved version provides a more realistic and interpretable demonstration of a decision tree for equine colic surgery prediction.
