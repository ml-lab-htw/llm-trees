**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Encoding Alignment:**  The code now uses the specific encodings provided for each feature.  This is crucial for correct interpretation of the data.
* **Thresholds:**  I've added reasonable threshold values based on veterinary knowledge where needed (e.g., pulse > 100, abdomcentesis total protein > 2.5).  These are just examples; optimal thresholds would be determined through data analysis and model training.
* **Missing Values:** I made assumptions when data may be missing or hard to classify, such as using "alert" in the "pain" feature as a proxy for no pain. Handling missing values properly is vital in real-world applications.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list now stores the boolean (True/False) result of each condition in the decision tree. These are converted to 1/0 before being returned.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree structure has been slightly modified to be a bit more linear and easier to follow in code, but still maintains the core diagnostic logic.



**Using the Function:**

You can call the function with a dictionary representing the features of a horse:

```python
horse_data = {
    'pain': 5, # intermittent severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 3, # severe
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3, # none
    'pulse': 120,
    'capillary_refill_time': 0, # > 3 seconds
    'mucous_membranes': 5, # pale cyanotic
    'rectal_examination': 4, # normal
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1, # clear
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'abdomen': 2, # distended small intestine
    'peristalsis': 1, # absent
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,
    'rectal_temperature': None,
    'respiratory_rate': None,
    'temp_extremities': None,
    'peripheral_pulse': None,
    'packed_cell_volume': None,
    'total_protein': None,
    'outcome': None,
    'surgery': None,
    'Age': None
}


prediction, nodes = predict(horse_data)
print(f"Prediction (0=no surgery, 1=surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 

```

Remember, this is still a simplified example.  A real-world application would require a model trained on a real dataset for accurate predictions.
