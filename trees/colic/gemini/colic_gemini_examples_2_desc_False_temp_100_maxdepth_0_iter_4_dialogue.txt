I understand. You want a Python function that makes a surgical prediction for horse colic based on a decision tree, and you want the function to also output the truth values of the decision nodes.  

**Since I don't have the labeled dataset, I'll create a plausible decision tree structure.  Keep in mind that without real data, the thresholds and feature choices are speculative.**

```python
def predict_colic_surgery(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether horse colic is likely surgical based on a decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of horse features (see feature descriptions).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 0 = No surgery, 1 = Surgery
            nodes (list): List of truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node.
    """

    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 1: Severe Abdominal Distension?
    nodes[0] = X['abdominal_distension'] == 3  

    # Node 2: Absent Peristalsis? 
    nodes[1] = X['peristalsis'] == 1 

    # Node 3: High Pulse?
    nodes[2] = X['pulse'] > 80

    # Node 4: Abnormal Mucous Membranes?
    nodes[3] = X['mucous_membranes'] in [2, 3, 5, 6]  # Excluding normal and bright pink

    # Node 5: High Nasogastric Reflux pH? 
    nodes[4] = X['nasogastric_reflux_PH'] > 7.5 if X['nasogastric_reflux_PH'] is not None else False

    # Decision Logic:
    if nodes[0] or nodes[1]:  # Severe distension or absent peristalsis
        prediction = 1  # Likely surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2] and (nodes[3] or nodes[4]):  # High pulse AND (abnormal membranes OR high reflux pH)
            prediction = 1 # Likely surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Likely not surgical

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage:

    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 1,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 95,
    'respiratory_rate': 25,
    'temp_extremities': 2,

    'mucous_membranes': 3,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 2,
    'peristalsis': 3,
    'abdominal_distension': 3,

prediction, nodes = predict_colic_surgery(horse_features)

print(f"Prediction (0=No Surgery, 1=Surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Decision Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`predict_colic_surgery(X)` Function:**
    *   Takes a dictionary `X` of horse features as input.
    *   Initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the decision nodes.
    *   Defines the decision nodes (using placeholder thresholds for now) and evaluates their truth values based on the input features.
    *   Implements the decision logic based on the tree structure.
    *   Returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of `nodes`.

2. **Decision Nodes & Thresholds:**
 * **Important:** The thresholds I've used (e.g., pulse > 80, pH > 7.5) are just examples. You'll need to determine the most appropriate thresholds based on veterinary knowledge or data analysis once you have a dataset.

3. **Example Usage:**
 * The example shows how to call the function with a sample horse and interpret the output. 

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. A real-world decision tree might be more complex and require a larger dataset to train and validate effectively.
