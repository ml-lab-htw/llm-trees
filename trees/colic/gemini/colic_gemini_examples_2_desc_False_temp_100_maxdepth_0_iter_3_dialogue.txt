You're asking to build a decision tree function *without* any data to train it on. This is like writing a recipe without knowing the ingredients or the desired outcome!  

To create a meaningful decision tree and its corresponding Python function, I need a labeled dataset of horse colic cases.

**Here's a hypothetical example to illustrate:**

Let's assume, based on veterinary knowledge, these are important features and thresholds for surgical colic:

* **pulse:** Pulse > 100 bpm suggests a higher likelihood of surgery.
* **abdominal_distension:** Severe abdominal distension is also a concern.
* **packed_cell_volume:**  A high packed cell volume (PCV) can indicate dehydration, a common factor in surgical colic.

**Hypothetical Python Function:**

```python
def predict_colic(X: dict):
  """Predicts surgical colic (hypothetical example).

  Args:
    X: A dictionary of features.

  Returns:
    A tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
      prediction: 1 for surgical colic, 0 for non-surgical.
      nodes: A list of truth values for each node condition.
  """

  nodes = 3 * [None]
  nodes[0] = X["pulse"] > 100 
  nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # Assuming 3 = severe
  nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 50  # Assuming >50% is high

  if nodes[0]:  # High pulse
    if nodes[1]:  # Severe distension
      prediction = 1  # Likely surgical
    else: 
      if nodes[2]:  # High PCV
        prediction = 1  # More likely surgical
      else:
        prediction = 0  # Less likely
  else:  # Normal pulse
    if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:  # Both distension and high PCV are concerning
      prediction = 1 
    else:
      prediction = 0 

  return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` List:** This list stores whether the condition at each node in the decision tree is true (1) or false (0). It helps understand the path taken for a prediction.
2. **Decision Logic:** The `if/else` statements represent the decision points in the tree. The order of the features and thresholds reflects their assumed importance in this hypothetical example.

**Important Notes:**

* **This is a simplified example!** Real-world colic prediction would require more complex decision-making and many more features.
* **Without data, this tree is not accurate!**  It is crucial to have a real dataset to determine the most important features and thresholds.

**Provide me with a dataset, and I can help you create a much more accurate and useful decision tree model!**
