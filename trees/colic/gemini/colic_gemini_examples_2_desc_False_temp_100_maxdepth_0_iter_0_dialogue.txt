**Explanation:**

* **nodes:** A list to store the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions at each inner node.
* **Thresholds:** I've chosen some initial threshold values based on general veterinary knowledge. These are just starting points and would need to be refined with real data and potentially more sophisticated methods. 
* **Tree Structure:**  The `if-else` statements represent the decision tree's branches. The order of the nodes in the code reflects the tree's structure.

**Important Notes:**

* **Simplified Example:** This is a highly simplified decision tree. Real-world colic diagnosis is complex and requires considering many factors.
* **Threshold Optimization:**  The chosen thresholds are preliminary. To get a more accurate model, you'll need to use a decision tree algorithm with a dataset to find the optimal split points for each feature. 
* **Feature Importance:**  This tree doesn't necessarily use all the features you provided. A machine learning algorithm can help determine which features are most predictive.

**How to Use the Function:**

You would call the `predict(X)` function, passing in a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a single horse. The function will return:

* **prediction:**  The predicted class (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).
* **nodes:** The list of truth values representing which conditions in the tree were met.
