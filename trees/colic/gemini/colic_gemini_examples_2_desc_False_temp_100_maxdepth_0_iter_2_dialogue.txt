Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # severe or moderate
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # severe
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80
    nodes[3] = X["rectal_examination"] == 1  # absent
    nodes[4] = X["pain"] >= 4  # intermittent severe pain or continuous severe pain

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # moderate distension
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # slight or no distension
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            if X["peristalsis"] == 1:  # absent
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a horse and returns two things:
1. A prediction: 1 for surgical cases, 0 for non-surgical cases.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

The function uses the following key features to make the prediction:
- `abdominal_distension`: Primary indicator (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
- `pulse`: Measured in beats per minute
- `rectal_examination`: Rectal examination findings (1 = absent, 2 = decreased, 3 = increased, 4 = normal)
- `pain`: Degree of pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain,
