**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The decision tree is constructed heuristically based on domain knowledge (or reasonable assumptions) about what factors might indicate whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery.

* **Pulse:**  A high pulse rate is often a sign of distress and could be indicative of a more serious condition requiring surgical intervention.
* **Pain:**  Severe or continuous pain is a strong indicator that surgery might be necessary to address the underlying cause.
* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):**  A high PCV can indicate dehydration, which can be a complication of colic and may necessitate surgery if other treatments are ineffective.

The tree structure reflects a prioritized assessment of these factors.  A high pulse rate is the first consideration. If the pulse is high, the presence of severe pain is then checked.  If both pulse and pain are elevated, surgery is predicted.  If the pulse is high but pain is not severe, the PCV is considered as an additional factor.

**Important Notes:**

* **Heuristic Approach:** This decision tree is built based on general assumptions about the relationship between the features and the target variable. It's crucial to understand that this is *not* a data-driven approach.  A real-world decision tree for such a complex medical diagnosis would require extensive training on a large dataset.
* **Feature Selection:** The features were chosen based on their potential relevance to surgical intervention in colic cases. Other features may also be important.
* **Depth Limitation:** The tree has been constrained to a maximum depth of 3 to adhere to the prompt's requirement. A more complex tree might be more accurate in a real-world scenario.
* **Validation and Refinement:**  In a real-world application, it would be essential to validate the performance of the decision tree on real data and refine it based on the results.  This process may involve changing the features used, the thresholds used in the decision nodes, and the overall structure of the tree.


This response provides a functional solution to the problem posed, while also highlighting the limitations and considerations that are important in a practical context.  It is crucial to remember that medical diagnosis should always be performed by qualified professionals and not rely solely on automated systems like decision trees.
