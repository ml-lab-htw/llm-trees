```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pulse"] > 80  # Pulse over 80 bpm suggests potential surgical case
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] >= 4 #  Pain level 4 or 5 (intermittent severe/continuous severe)

    if nodes[0]:  # High pulse
        if nodes[1]: # High Pain
            prediction = 1  # Likely Surgical
        else: # Low Pain (but high pulse)
            prediction = 0  # Possibly Non-Surgical - Further investigation
    else: # Normal Pulse
        if nodes[1]:  # High Pain (despite normal pulse)
           prediction = 1 # Possibly Surgical - Further investigation
        else:  # Low pain, normal pulse
            prediction = 0  # Likely Non-Surgical

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Simplified Model:** This remains a simplified model for illustrative purposes and is *not* suitable for actual veterinary diagnosis.
* **Thresholds:** The pulse threshold of 80 bpm and pain threshold of 4 are chosen as reasonable examples, but optimal values would require analysis of real data and veterinary expertise.
* **Feature Encoding:** The function assumes the features are encoded as described in your provided information.  Ensure the input `X` dictionary uses these encodings.
* **Missing Values:** This function doesn't handle missing values explicitly. In a real-world application, you would need to implement appropriate strategies for handling missing data.
* **Clinical Judgement:** This function should never replace the judgment of a qualified veterinarian.  It is crucial to emphasize that this is a simplified example and should not be used in practice.


This improved version addresses the prompt by providing a Python function that:

1. Uses the specified feature names and their encoding.
2. Implements a decision tree (albeit a simplified one) based on pulse and pain.
3. Returns both the prediction and a list of truth values representing the conditions at each node.
4. Uses more realistic thresholds, though these would need further refinement with actual data and veterinary input.
