```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Moderate/Severe Pain (using encoding 2 and 5 for pain)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 80
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery (for now)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery (likely medical colic)
        nodes[1] = None  # No second node evaluated if the first one is false


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Pain Encoding:**  The original prompt didn't map well to a simple mild/moderate/severe scale.  This code uses the provided encoding, assuming 2 (continuous severe pain) and 5 (intermittent severe pain) represent the "moderate/severe" branch.  Adjust this if a different interpretation of the pain scale is intended.   Ideally, the pain data would be preprocessed into an ordinal scale (1-3 or 1-4) for simplicity.
* **Pulse Threshold:**  The 80 bpm threshold remains as in the original proposal.
* **Node Tracking:** The `nodes` list now correctly reflects which conditions were evaluated.  If the first condition (pain) is false, the second condition (pulse) is not evaluated, and `nodes[1]` is set to `None`.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is slightly restructured to enhance clarity and align with standard Python style.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_horse = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 1,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 100,
    'respiratory_rate': 24,
    'temp_extremities': 1,
    'peripheral_pulse': 2,
    'mucous_membranes': 6,
    'capillary_refill_time': 0,
    'pain': 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    'peristalsis': 3,
    'abdominal_distension': 1,
    'nasogastric_tube': 2,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,  # Missing value
    'rectal_examination': 3,
    'abdomen': 1,
    'packed_cell_volume': 45,
    'total_protein': 7.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 3,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 4.0,
    'outcome': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True]

example_horse2 = { 'pain': 4, 'pulse': 60 } # Intermittent mild pain, normal pulse.

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_horse2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No Surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, None]

This revised function provides a functional implementation of the simplified decision tree and tracks the node evaluations, crucial for understanding the decision-making process. Remember, this is still a simplified model; real-world diagnosis is much more nuanced.
