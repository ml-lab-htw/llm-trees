I understand! You want a Python function that represents a decision tree for predicting surgical necessity in horse colic cases, along with a list tracking the truth values of each node condition. 

However, I need data to determine appropriate thresholds and the most influential features.  A decision tree learns these from the data itself. Without a dataset, any thresholds I set would be arbitrary and likely inaccurate. 

**Here's a template for the function, using placeholders for now:**

```python
def predict_colic_surgery(X: dict):
    """Predicts the need for surgery in a horse colic case.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features for the horse colic case.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0=no surgery, 1=surgery) 
               and a list of truth values for each node condition.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Placeholder for up to 3 nodes (depth 2)

    # Example node conditions - REPLACE WITH REAL LOGIC AFTER DATA ANALYSIS
    nodes[0] = X["pulse"] <= 100  # Placeholder
    nodes[1] = X["rectal_temperature"] >= 38.5  # Placeholder
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] >= 45  # Placeholder (if applicable)

    # Decision tree logic (replace with actual learned logic)
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Example: High pulse and temp -> surgery likely
        else:
            prediction = 0 
    else:
        if nodes[2]:  # Only used if depth > 1
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (with placeholder data)
example_horse = {
    "surgery": 1, 
    "Age": 0, 
    "rectal_temperature": 39.0, 
    "pulse": 110,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "temp_extremities": 3, 
    "peripheral_pulse": 3, 
    "mucous_membranes": 4, 
    "capillary_refill_time": 1, 
    "pain": 3,
    "peristalsis": 4, 
    "abdominal_distension": 2, 
    "nasogastric_tube": 1, 
    "nasogastric_reflux": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": None, 
    "rectal_examination": 4, 
    "abdomen": 4, 
    "packed_cell_volume": 40, 
    "total_protein": 7.0, 
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1, 
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": None, 
    "outcome": 3
}

prediction, node_truth_values = predict_colic_surgery(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction (0=no surgery, 1=surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {node_truth_values}") 
```

**To complete this function, please provide:**

* **Your horse colic dataset:** This is essential for me to learn the decision tree logic. 
* **Desired depth:** Confirm if you want a depth of 2 or if you'd like to explore other depths based on the data. 

Once I have this information, I can create a data-driven and accurate `predict_colic_surgery` function!
