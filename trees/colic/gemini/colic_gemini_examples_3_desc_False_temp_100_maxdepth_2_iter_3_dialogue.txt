You got it! Now I understand how you want the Python function structured.  However, I still need the actual data to determine the most important features and their thresholds. 

**Here's a template function based on your examples:**

```python
def predict_colic_surgery(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts if a horse with colic requires surgery based on clinical features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features. See feature descriptions above.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            prediction (int): 0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery
            nodes (list): Truth values (0/1) for each decision node condition.
    """

    # --- Placeholder for now, replace with actual feature and threshold --- 
    feature1 = "pain"  
    threshold1 = 3  # Example: Moderate/severe pain

    # --- Placeholder, replace with second feature and threshold ---
    feature2 = "abdominal_distension"
    threshold2 = 2  # Example: Any distension present

    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # --- Decision Node 1 ---
    nodes[0] = X[feature1] > threshold1  

    # --- Decision Node 2 (Only evaluated if Node 1 is True) --- 
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X[feature2] > threshold2  
    else:
        nodes[1] = 0  # Not evaluated

    # --- Prediction based on the decision path ---
    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Surgery likely
        else:
            prediction = 0  #  Surgery less likely
    else:
        prediction = 0  #  Surgery less likely

    return prediction, nodes

```

**To complete this function, I need your dataset:**

1. **Data format:** CSV, Excel, or a Python list of dictionaries (like the `X` input in the function).
2. **Feature columns:** As described in your previous message.
3. **Target column:**  "surgery" with values 0 (no surgery) and 1 (surgery).

**Once I have the data, I'll:**

1. **Identify the two most important features.**
2. **Determine appropriate thresholds** for those features.
3. **Replace the placeholders** in the function with the actual values. 

Let me know when you have the data ready!
