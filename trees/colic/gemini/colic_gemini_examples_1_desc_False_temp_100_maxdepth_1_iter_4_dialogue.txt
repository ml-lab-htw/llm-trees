```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # 3 represents 'severe'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Requires surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Does not require surgery (in this simplified model)

    return prediction, nodes
