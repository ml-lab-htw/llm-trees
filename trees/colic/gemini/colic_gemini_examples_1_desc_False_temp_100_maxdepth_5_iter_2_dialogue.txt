**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **No Data, Simulated Tree:**  This tree is entirely hypothetical, based on general veterinary knowledge about colic.  It *cannot* replace a veterinarian's diagnosis.  The thresholds and feature choices are for demonstration purposes only.  A real decision tree would be trained on data and would likely have different structure and thresholds.
* **Depth and Complexity:**  The tree has a maximum depth of 5 to meet the requirements, but it might not be the optimal depth.  With real data, you would use techniques like cross-validation to determine the best depth.
* **Feature Encoding:** Pay very close attention to the encoding provided. The function assumes the exact same encoding. The final mapping to 0 and 1 is done based on the encoding given (1 = no surgery, 2 = yes surgery).
* **Missing Values:** This function doesn't handle missing values.  In a real application, you'd need to add logic to deal with missing data appropriately (e.g., imputation, using a default branch in the tree).
* **Real-World Application:**  This simplified example is just a starting point.  Real-world medical diagnosis requires careful consideration of many factors, expert knowledge, and rigorous testing.  This code is not meant for clinical use.


To use this function, you would provide a dictionary `X` containing the horse's features. The function returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` representing the truth values at each decision point.  This `nodes` list can be helpful for understanding the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.
