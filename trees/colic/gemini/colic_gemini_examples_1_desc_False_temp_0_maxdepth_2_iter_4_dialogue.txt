```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  #  Mild pain is encoded as 4, thus >2 acts as a threshold. 2 includes alert, severe, mild intermittent pain. >2 catches continuous pain
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60

    if nodes[0]:  # If pain > mild
        if nodes[1]: # If pulse > 60
            prediction = 1 # surgery
        else: # If pulse <= 60
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
    else: # If pain <= mild
        prediction = 0 # no surgery

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Pain Threshold:**  The original prompt used "mild" as a threshold for pain.  The provided feature encoding for pain doesn't directly have a "mild" category. However, it does have "intermittent mild pain (4)". Since lower values seem to correspond to more severe or continuous pain, I've used `X["pain"] > 2` as a proxy. This means if pain is "alert(1), continuous severe pain (2)", we classify it as high, while "intermittent mild pain(4), intermittent severe pain(5)" are classified as lower pain. This could be refined with more domain knowledge or a better encoding.

2. **Pulse Threshold:** The pulse threshold of 60 bpm remains. While a normal range exists for horses, 60 bpm serves as a reasonable starting point for distinguishing potentially serious cases. This could also be optimized with data.

3. **Data-Driven Approach:**  This function provides a basic decision tree structure.  However, it's crucial to reiterate that the best thresholds and features should be determined using a dataset and a decision tree learning algorithm. This example is based on plausible veterinary reasoning but may not be optimal.  A data-driven model would likely outperform this simplified version.

4. **Missing Values:**  The provided data description mentions missing values for some features.  The current function doesn't handle them. In a real-world application, you'd need to implement strategies for dealing with missing data (e.g., imputation, using a separate branch in the tree).



This improved function now adheres to the required format, provides a more concrete implementation based on the available feature encodings, and includes a more detailed explanation with caveats and suggestions for improvement. Remember to always validate and refine such models with real-world data whenever possible.
