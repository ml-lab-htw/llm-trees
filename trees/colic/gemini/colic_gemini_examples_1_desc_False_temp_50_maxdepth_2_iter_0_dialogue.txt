```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # Pain greater than mild/alert (using 2 as a proxy for mild pain)
    nodes[1] = X["abdomen"] > 4 # Abdomen appearance is NOT normal (1-4 normal, 5 is other/abnormal)

    if nodes[0]:  # If pain > mild
        if nodes[1]: # If abnormal abdomen
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else: # If normal abdomen 
            prediction = 0 # No surgery (potentially manage pain medically)
    else: # If pain <= mild
        prediction = 0 # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes


```


**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`X["pain"] > 2`**:  The `pain` feature is encoded with 1 being the least severe (alert) and 5 the most (intermittent severe pain).  We are using `> 2` to represent a split between "mild" and more severe pain categories.  Ideally, with real data, a decision tree algorithm would find the optimal split point, which might not be exactly at 2.


* **`X["abdomen"] > 4`**:  The `abdomen` feature is encoded 1-5. Values 1-4 represent different presentations (including normal at 4), while 5 signifies "other," capturing a variety of abnormal presentations not specifically listed.  Thus, `> 4` efficiently separates "normal" from "abnormal" abdomen.



**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Dependence:**  The effectiveness of this tree depends heavily on the actual data distribution. With real data, the algorithm might choose different features or thresholds, potentially even swapping the order of the checks.

* **Depth Limitation:** The depth-2 constraint severely limits the tree's complexity. A deeper tree would likely achieve better accuracy by incorporating more features and nuances.

* **Ordinal vs. Nominal:**  The provided encoding treats some ordinal features (like pain and abdomen appearance) as nominal. A more sophisticated approach might leverage the ordinal nature of these features during tree construction.

* **Missing Values:** The code doesn't handle potential missing values. A real-world implementation should address this (e.g., imputation, separate branches for missing data).



This revised code provides a functional Python representation of the proposed decision tree, with more explicit threshold choices based on the feature encodings.  Remember, its true performance can only be evaluated with actual horse colic data and a proper training process.
