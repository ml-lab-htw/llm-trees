**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Encoding:** The function directly uses the encoding provided in the prompt for features like `pain`, `capillary_refill_time`, `abdominal_distension`, `nasogastric_reflux`, `rectal_examination`, and `abdominocentesis_appearance`.  Make absolutely sure your input data uses the same encoding.
* **Thresholds:** Thresholds like the pulse rate (60 bpm) are based on general veterinary principles but could be refined with actual data.
* **Missing Values:** This function does *not* handle missing values explicitly.  In a real-world application, you would need to implement strategies for handling missing data (imputation, exclusion, etc.).
* **Simplified Logic:** This decision tree is a simplified representation of a complex medical decision.  It does not account for all possible scenarios and should *not* be used for real diagnosis.
* **Data Required:**  To build a truly accurate and reliable decision tree for horse colic surgery, you *must* use a real dataset and train a machine learning model.  This hypothetical example is just for illustrative purposes and to demonstrate the Python function format.


This function should give you the requested structure and logic based on the hypothetical tree. Remember to adapt and train it with real data for any practical application.
