    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 4  # Using pain > 4 to approximate "moderate to severe pain"
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0 or X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 1 # Reflux present (< or > 1 liter)


    if nodes[0]:  # Significant pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Elevated pulse
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else: # Normal pulse
            if nodes[2]: #Nasogastric reflux present
                 prediction = 1 #Surgery - possible impaction colic
            else: # No reflux
                 prediction = 0 # No surgery (but investigate further)

    else:  # Mild or no pain
        prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Pain Mapping:**  The `pain` feature mapping is used to create a threshold approximating "moderate to severe pain" (values 2 and 5 in the original mapping likely correspond to more severe pain).  
* **Pulse Threshold:** A pulse over 60 bpm in a horse is often considered elevated and could indicate a surgical emergency.
* **Nasogastric Reflux:** Presence of reflux, regardless of volume, is suggestive of an obstruction. This is now included as a deciding factor when pain is present but the pulse is normal, potentially capturing impaction colic cases that might require surgery.
* **Truth Values List:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node.
* **No Abdominal Distension:**  Abdominal distension, while important, was removed from this simplified tree due to the depth constraint. In a real-world application, this feature should be included.

**Again, this function is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for actual veterinary diagnosis.** A proper decision tree requires training on a dataset with a robust set of features and corresponding surgical outcomes. Using this hypothetical function on real horses could lead to incorrect and potentially harmful decisions.
