**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added thresholds for pulse rate and abdominocentesis protein based on typical veterinary guidelines. These thresholds might need adjustment based on your specific dataset and expert consultation.
* **Simplified Logic:** This decision tree is a simplification. Real-world colic diagnosis is complex and involves many factors not captured here. 
* **Decision Support:**  This function is meant to be a decision support tool. The final decision for surgery should always be made by a qualified veterinarian after a thorough examination of the horse.

**How to Use the Function:**

1. **Input:** Pass a dictionary `X` containing the horse's clinical data. The keys of the dictionary should match the feature names exactly.
2. **Output:** The function will return a tuple:
   -  `prediction`: `1` if surgery is predicted, `0` if not.
   -  `nodes`: A list representing the truth values (`1` for True, `0` for False) of the conditions checked at each inner node of the decision tree. This can be useful for understanding the reasoning behind the prediction.
