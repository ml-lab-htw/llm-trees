```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # Example split condition 1
    nodes[1] = X["rectal_temperature"] <= 37.5  # Example split condition 2

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1
    else:
        prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification:**

The task is to create a decision tree function *without training*. This means we're creating a plausible tree structure based on the provided features, but not using any data to optimize the splits. 

I chose "pulse" and "rectal_temperature" as the splitting features for the following reasons:

* **Physiological Relevance:** Both pulse and rectal temperature are vital signs often used to assess a horse's health.  A high pulse can indicate stress, pain, or other complications, which might correlate with the need for surgery.  Similarly, a high rectal temperature could signal infection or inflammation, potentially requiring surgical intervention.

* **Numeric Features:** These features are numerical, which makes them suitable for creating "less than or equal to" split conditions.

* **Tree Structure:**  The code implements a depth-2 decision tree. The first split is on "pulse". If the pulse is less than or equal to 80, we move to the next level and check "rectal_temperature". The split values (80 and 37.5) are chosen arbitrarily, as there's no data to optimize them.

**Important Notes:**

* **Arbitrary Splits:** Because this is a non-trained tree, the split points and the resulting predictions are essentially educated guesses.  The performance of this tree on real data is not guaranteed.
* **Feature Selection:**  The choice of "pulse" and "rectal_temperature" is a reasonable starting point based on domain knowledge (or a quick search online about common indicators for horse colic requiring surgery).  However, with real data, other features might be more relevant.
* **Maximum Depth:** The tree adheres to the specified maximum depth of 2.
* **Python Function Format:** The code is in the requested Python function format, returning both the prediction and a list of the node truth values.



To improve this decision tree, you would need to train it using a labeled dataset of horse colic cases, using a decision tree learning algorithm that finds the best features and split points based on the data.  Algorithms like CART, ID3, or C4.5 would be suitable for this task.  They will use metrics like information gain or Gini impurity to select the optimal splits and build a more accurate model.
