**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Pain Mapping:** The original tree used "mild pain".  Since the provided `pain` feature has a different encoding, I created a simplified mapping where "alert" and "intermittent mild pain" are considered "mild" for the purpose of this tree.  This is a simplification; a real model would learn more complex relationships from data.
* **Other Feature Mappings:** Similar adjustments were made for other features to match the logic of the original textual tree as closely as possible, given the provided encodings.
* **Missing Information:**  The provided encoding lacks crucial information for some branches, especially the nasogastric reflux amount and pH. I've made reasonable assumptions using pH < 2 as a proxy for potential ulcers.  In a real application, the correct encoding and complete data would be essential.
* **Simplified "Observe" Cases:** The "Observe / Further Diagnostics" branches are simplified to return 0 (no surgery) in this example. A more realistic implementation would involve further diagnostic steps and possibly return a special value indicating the need for more information.



This function now adheres to the specified format, using the provided feature names and returning both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.  It's still a hypothetical example, and its accuracy would be entirely dependent on the quality and completeness of the real-world data used to train a proper decision tree model.
