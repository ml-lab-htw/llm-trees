**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds for `pulse`, `capillary_refill_time`, `rectal_examination`,  `abdomen`, and `abdominal_distension`. These are educated guesses;  optimal values require data analysis.
* **Encoding:** The code now uses the specific encodings provided for the features.  It's crucial that the input `X` uses these exact encodings.
* **Node Tracking:** The `nodes` list records the boolean value (True/False, represented as 1/0) of each decision node's condition. This provides insight into the path taken through the tree.
* **Simplified Structure:** I've condensed the tree slightly while trying to preserve the core logic based on the most critical factors for surgical intervention. A real decision tree trained on data might have different branching.


**To Use the Function:**

Create a dictionary representing the features for a single horse and pass it to the `predict` function:

```python
horse_data = {
    'surgery': 1, 
    'Age': 0, 
    'rectal_temperature': 37.8, 
    'pulse': 120, 
    'respiratory_rate': 24, 
    'temp_extremities': 1, 
    'peripheral_pulse': 2, 
    'mucous_membranes': 4, 
    'capillary_refill_time': 0, 
    'pain': 5, 
    'peristalsis': 3, 
    'abdominal_distension': 3, 
    'nasogastric_tube': 2, 
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0, 
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 7.2, 
    'rectal_examination': 1, 
    'abdomen': 2, 
    'packed_cell_volume': 45, 
    'total_protein': 6.5, 
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 2, 
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 3.2, 
    'outcome': 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(horse_data)
print(f"Prediction (0=no surgery, 1=surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}") 
```


This will output the predicted class (0 or 1) and the list of node conditions. Remember to train a proper decision tree model with a dataset for a more robust and accurate classifier.  This function is merely a structured representation of your hypothetical tree with some refinements.
