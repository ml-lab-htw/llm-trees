```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["surgery"] == 2  # If surgery is yes (2)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 80 # Pulse greater than 80 (somewhat arbitrary, but reasonable threshold)
    
    if nodes[0]: # surgery needed
        if nodes[1]: # high pulse
            prediction = 1 # Likely surgery
        else: # normal pulse
            prediction = 1  # Still likely surgery given surgery recommended
    else: # no surgery
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The task is to create a decision tree of maximum depth 2 *without* training on data.  Therefore, we must use our domain knowledge (or reasonable guesses) about which features are important and how they might relate to the target variable ("target": whether surgery is needed).

Here's the logic behind the generated tree:

1. **Root Node (nodes[0]): `surgery == 2`**:  The "surgery" feature seems like the most direct indicator of whether surgery is needed.  If the input suggests surgery (`surgery == 2` which means "yes"), it's a strong signal toward a positive prediction (surgery needed).

2. **Second Level Node (nodes[1]):  `pulse > 80`**: If surgery is indicated, a high pulse rate might be a secondary indicator of the severity of the situation, potentially influencing the need for surgery (though this is a simplification).  A pulse rate above 80 bpm in a horse could be considered elevated and might suggest a more critical condition.

3. **Leaf Nodes (Predictions):**
   - If `surgery == 2` (yes) and `pulse > 80` (high): Predict surgery (1).
   - If `surgery == 2` (yes) and `pulse <= 80` (normal/low): Still predict surgery (1), as the "surgery" recommendation likely overrides the pulse information.
   - If `surgery == 1` (no): Predict no surgery (0). This branch relies heavily on the assumption that the `surgery` feature is accurate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** The tree is built based on assumptions and potential relationships, not on actual data patterns.  Its performance on real data is unknown.
* **Feature Importance (Heuristic):** The choice of "surgery" and "pulse" as the most important features is a heuristic.  Other features might be more relevant in reality.
* **Thresholds:** The pulse threshold (80 bpm) is chosen somewhat arbitrarily.  A proper decision tree trained on data would learn optimal thresholds.
* **Depth Limitation:** The maximum depth of 2 restricts the complexity of the tree. A deeper tree could potentially capture more nuanced relationships.


This generated function fulfills the prompt's requirements: a decision tree function of maximum depth 2, using specified features, and returning both a prediction and a list of node truth values.  However, its accuracy is entirely dependent on the validity of the assumptions made in its construction.  Real-world application would require training on a dataset of horse colic cases.
