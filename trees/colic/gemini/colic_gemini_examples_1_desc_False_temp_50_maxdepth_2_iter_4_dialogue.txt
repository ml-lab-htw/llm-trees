```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # Pain greater than mild/alert (using 2 as a proxy for mild pain or less)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60

    if nodes[0]:  # If pain > mild/alert
        if nodes[1]:  # If pulse > 60
            prediction = 1  # Likely surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Possibly no surgery
    else:  # If pain <= mild/alert
        prediction = 0  # Likely no surgery


    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Pain Encoding:** The "pain" feature encoding uses 1 for alert, which might not equate to "no pain." We've used a threshold of > 2 to capture moderate to severe pain as an indicator for potential surgery.  Ideally, a "no pain" category (or a clearer definition of "alert") would improve accuracy.
* **Pulse Threshold:** The pulse threshold of 60 bpm is a reasonable starting point but might need adjustment based on the horse's age, breed, and other factors.  A more refined model might use different thresholds for different subpopulations.
* **Missing Values:** The provided data descriptions indicate missing values for some features. The function currently doesn't handle these.  In a real application, you would need to implement strategies for handling missing data (e.g., imputation, removal).
* **Tree Depth:**  A depth-2 tree is severely limited. A more complex tree (or a different model altogether) would be necessary for a more accurate prediction.



**Example Usage:**

```python
horse_data = {
    'pain': 5,  # Intermittent severe pain
    'pulse': 85,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(horse_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [True, True]
```
