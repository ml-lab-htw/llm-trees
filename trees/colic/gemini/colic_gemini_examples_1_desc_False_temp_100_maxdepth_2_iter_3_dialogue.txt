**Explanation and VERY IMPORTANT Caveats (repeated from previous response):**

* **This function is a simplified example and should NOT be used for actual veterinary diagnosis.** Real-world colic diagnosis is complex and requires a veterinarian's expertise.
* A depth-2 tree is highly limited for this problem. A real diagnostic tree would be much deeper.
* This simplifies the "pain" feature significantly. In practice, a vet considers the specific pain level and its trend.
*  Without actual data and training, this function is purely hypothetical and likely inaccurate. It is based on general principles, not data insights.


To build a truly effective decision tree (or other model) for surgical colic prediction, you would need a large, labeled dataset and use machine learning methods. This example provides a basic demonstration of the decision tree logic but should **not** be interpreted as a reliable diagnostic tool.
