**Explanation of the chosen thresholds and features:**

* **`pain >= 3`:**  A pain level of 3 or higher (moderate to severe) is a strong indicator that surgery might be required.
* **`pulse > 100`:**  A high pulse rate can suggest a serious condition requiring intervention, potentially surgical.  100 bpm is used as a reasonable threshold, but this could vary depending on the horse's age and condition.
* **`packed_cell_volume > 50`:** A high packed cell volume could suggest dehydration, which might be a factor in deciding on surgery.  50% is used as a placeholder; veterinary expertise would be needed for a more precise value.
* **`abdominal_distension >= 2`:**  Moderate to severe abdominal distension is another significant indicator for possible surgery.

**Important Notes:**

* This decision tree is *synthetic*. It is not based on actual data or veterinary knowledge.  It's meant to illustrate how to structure the function based on your requirements.
* Real-world decision making for horse colic surgery is complex and requires professional veterinary diagnosis. This function should **not** be used for actual medical decisions.
* The chosen thresholds are placeholders. A real decision tree would require data analysis and veterinary expertise to determine appropriate values.  The specific features used and their combinations would also be determined by data analysis.


This improved version uses more meaningful feature combinations and thresholds within the `max_depth` constraint of 4 while adhering to your format requirements.  Remember, for accurate predictions, you *must* train a decision tree on real data. This example provides a functional framework, but its predictive power is very limited.
