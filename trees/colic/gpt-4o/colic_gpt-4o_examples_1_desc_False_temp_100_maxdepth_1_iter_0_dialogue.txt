Here's how we can implement the decision tree for classifying whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (maximum depth = 1) based on the feature `pain`. The goal is for the function to return a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the decision nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree with depth 1 to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or non-surgical.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Input features with the keys as specified in the feature list.

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes), where
        - prediction (int): 0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical.
        - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes, 1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Decision node: Degree of Pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Severe pain (2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Feature Selection**:
   The feature used for the split is `pain`. Severe pain is a strong indicator that surgery is needed, so we use it for the first decision node.

   - Values of `pain` indicating severe pain:
     - `2` corresponds to "continuous severe pain".
     - `5` corresponds to "intermittent severe pain".
   - All other values of `pain` (`1`, `3`, or `4`) are not considered severe.

2. **Nodes List**:
   The list `nodes` has one entry because the tree is of depth 1 with a single decision node. The condition (`X["pain"] in [2, 5]`) determines whether the node's condition is satisfied (1 for True, 0 for False).

3. **Prediction**:
   If the condition (`X["pain"] in [2, 5]`) evaluates to `True`, the prediction is `1` (surgical). Otherwise, the prediction is `0` (non-surgical).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input where pain value indicates severe pain
example_input_1 = {"pain": 2}  # Continuous severe pain
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input_1)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 1 (Surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Nodes: [1]

# Example input where pain value does not indicate severe pain
example_input_2 = {"pain": 3}  # Depressed state
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input_2)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 0 (Non-Surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Nodes: [0]
```

This decision tree function is simple yet effective for depth-1 classification based on the `pain` feature. If you'd like to extend the tree or change the criteria, let me know!
