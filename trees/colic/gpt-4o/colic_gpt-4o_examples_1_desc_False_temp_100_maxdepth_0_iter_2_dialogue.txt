### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: First, we check the degree of pain (`X["pain"]`). Severe pain (2: continuous severe pain, 5: intermittent severe pain) is a strong indicator of a surgical lesion.
- **Node 1**: If the pain is severe, we then check for severe abdominal distension (`X["abdominal_distension"] == 3`). If present, surgery is almost certain.
- **Node 2**: If severe distension is absent, we check if there is significant nasogastric reflux (`X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0`), which indicates surgery.
- **Node 3**: If the pain is not severe, significant nasogastric reflux can still indicate surgery.
- **Node 4**: If significant reflux is not present, moderate abdominal distension (`X["abdominal_distension"] == 1`) may still indicate surgery.
- **Node 5**: If distension is not moderate, a serosanguinous appearance in the abdominocentesis (`X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3`) strongly suggests surgery.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "pain": 5,  # intermittent severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # severe distension
    "nasogastric_reflux": 1,  # less than 1 liter
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2  # cloudy
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Surgical' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Surgical'}")
print(f"Decision path: {nodes}")
```

This function will return a prediction (`1` for surgical, `0` for non-surgical) and a list of boolean values (`nodes`), representing which conditions were met at each node in the decision tree.
