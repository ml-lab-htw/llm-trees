Here is a decision tree of depth 1 based on the Features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # Check if degree of pain is severe (greater than 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery likely needed
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery likely needed
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Decision Rule**: The feature chosen here is `"pain"`, which is a key indicator for determining whether surgery is needed. A pain level greater than 2 suggests more severe pain, and this could indicate a more serious condition requiring surgery.
- **Prediction**:
  - If `"pain"` is greater than 2 (i.e., severe pain), the prediction is `1` (surgery needed).
  - If `"pain"` is less than or equal to 2 (i.e., less severe or no pain), the prediction is `0` (no surgery needed).
  
### Truth Values:
- The list `nodes` contains the result of evaluating the condition (`X["pain"] > 2`). It will contain `1` if the condition is true (i.e., pain is severe), and `0` if false.
