Here is the implementation of the requested depth-1 decision tree as a Python function based on the provided feature descriptions. I used the **pain** feature as the most important feature to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or non-surgical (0) based on the degree of pain.
    
    Parameters:
    - X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values for a single example. Keys should match the
                exact spelling of the feature names.

    Returns:
    - prediction (int): 0 if the lesion is non-surgical, 1 if it is surgical.
    - nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
                    1 if the condition was satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize the inner node conditions array
    nodes = 1 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' indicates no or mild pain (non-surgical)
    #       pain == 1 (alert), pain == 3 (depressed), pain == 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in {1, 3, 4}
    
    # Make prediction based on the node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:
        prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inner node logic:**
   - The decision tree uses **pain** as the feature to classify the case.
   - If `pain` is one of `{1, 3, 4}` (indicating *alert*, *depressed*, or *intermittent mild pain*), then the lesion is **non-surgical** (class = 0).
   - Otherwise (e.g., continuous severe pain, intermittent severe pain), the lesion is **surgical** (class = 1).

2. **Nodes list:**
   - The `nodes` list contains a truth value (`1` or `0`) indicating whether the condition for the node was satisfied. 
   - For this depth-1 tree, `nodes` only has one entry since we only check one condition.

3. **Features included:**
   - The function assumes the input `X` is a dictionary where features are provided with their exact names. 

4. **Thresholds:** 
   - The thresholds for `pain` are meaningful and based on domain-specific knowledge about pain severity for colic cases.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example feature dictionary for a sample instance
X_sample = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 72,
    "respiratory_rate": 16,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 5.2,
    "rectal_examination": 3,
    "abdomen": 1,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 7.1,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.5,
    "outcome": 3,
}

# Predict using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0] (pain == 2 does not satisfy node 0 condition)
```

This function handles a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 and outputs both the prediction and internal node truth values as required. Let me know if you need a more complex tree!
