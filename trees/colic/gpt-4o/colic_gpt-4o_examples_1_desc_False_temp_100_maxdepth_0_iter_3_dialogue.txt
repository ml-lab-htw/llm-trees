### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the degree of pain. If the horse is experiencing severe pain (continuous or intermittent), it is a strong indicator that surgery is needed.
2. **Node 1**: If the pain is not severe, the next check is for **abdominal distension**. Severe distension suggests a more critical condition that may require surgery.
3. **Node 2**: If there is no severe distension, we check the amount of **nasogastric reflux**. If it is more than 1 liter, this supports the need for surgery.
4. **Node 3**: If there isn't significant nasogastric reflux, we check the **rectal examination findings**. Distension in the small intestine or abnormal findings are strong indicators of a surgical case.
5. **Node 4**: Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, we check the **packed cell volume (PCV)**. A value greater than 50% suggests dehydration or circulatory compromise, which may indicate surgery is required.

### Output:

- `prediction`: Will be `1` if surgery is needed, and `0` if surgery is not needed.
- `nodes`: A list of boolean values indicating whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied (1 for true, 0 for false).
