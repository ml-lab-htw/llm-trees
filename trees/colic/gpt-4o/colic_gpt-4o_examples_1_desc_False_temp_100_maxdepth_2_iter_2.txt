Based on the Features and target variable you've provided, let's construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. We'll select the most important features based on their potential relevance to the target variable (whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not). Given that this is a hypothetical scenario, we'll use domain knowledge and intuition to build the tree.

### Selected Features:
1. **pain**: Pain is often a strong indicator of the severity of a condition and could be related to surgery. We will use this as the first decision node.
2. **rectal_temperature**: A lower or higher-than-normal rectal temperature might indicate a more severe condition, which could influence the need for surgery.
3. **packed_cell_volume**: Packed cell volume gives an indication of blood concentration, which might be relevant in assessing the severity of the colic.

### Decision Tree:
- **Node 1**: Check if the horse has **severe pain** (degree of pain is 2). Severe pain could be a strong indicator that surgery is needed.
- **Node 2**: If there is no severe pain, check if the **rectal temperature** is outside the normal range (e.g., less than 37°C or greater than 39°C). Abnormal temperature may indicate a more serious condition that could require surgery.
- **Node 3**: If temperature is within normal range, check if **packed cell volume** is high (e.g., above 50%). High packed cell volume may indicate dehydration or other issues requiring surgery.

Now, let's define the Python function for this decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Severe pain or not
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Severe pain, likely requires surgery
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 2: Check rectal temperature outside normal range
        nodes[1] = X["rectal_temperature"] < 37 or X["rectal_temperature"] > 39
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Abnormal temperature, likely requires surgery
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Node 3: Check if packed cell volume is high
            nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 50
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # High packed cell volume, likely requires surgery
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # No severe indicators, no surgery
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **pain == 2** (Severe continuous pain): If the horse has severe pain, it is likely to need surgery (prediction = 1).
2. **rectal_temperature < 37 or > 39**: If the horse's rectal temperature is outside the normal range, this could indicate a serious condition requiring surgery (prediction = 1).
3. **packed_cell_volume > 50**: If the packed cell volume is high, this could indicate a problem such as dehydration or inflammation that might require surgery (prediction = 1).

If none of these conditions are met, the prediction is that the horse does not need surgery (prediction = 0).

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "pain": 3,  # Depressed
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,  # Normal
    "packed_cell_volume": 45  # Normal
}
```

### Example Output:
```python
pred, nodes = predict(X)
print(pred)   # Output: 0 (no surgery)
print(nodes)  # Output: [False, False, False] (None of the conditions met)
```
