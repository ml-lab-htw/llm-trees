Using the given input format and feature descriptions, here is how the Python function would look for the depth-1 decision tree that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0), based on the most important feature (`pain`):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values with the exact keys:
        - pain: Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain,
                3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 if non-surgical, 1 if surgical
        - nodes (list): A list representing whether the condition of an inner node is satisfied (1) or not satisfied (0)
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 4  # If pain is greater than 4 (intermittent severe pain or higher)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery is required
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Surgery is not required
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Conditions:
1. The feature `pain` is chosen as the root node because pain levels (severity) are critical in determining whether a lesion requires surgery. Severe pain typically necessitates surgical intervention.
2. The threshold is set as `pain > 4` because:
   - Pain levels of `5` (intermittent severe pain) and `2` (continuous severe pain in a different coding structure from the original description) are suggestive of more critical cases.
   - Levels `1` (alert), `3` (depressed), and `4` (intermittent mild pain) are less likely to indicate a surgical case.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {"pain": 5}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Surgery required)
print(f"Truth values of inner nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Truth values of inner nodes: [1]
```

### Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `{"pain": 4}`  
   **Output:** `Prediction: 0`, `Nodes: [0]`  
   **Explanation:** Pain is not greater than 4, so it's classified as non-surgical.

2. **Input:** `{"pain": 5}`  
   **Output:** `Prediction: 1`, `Nodes: [1]`  
   **Explanation:** Pain is greater than 4, so it's classified as surgical.

3. **Input:** `{"pain": 3}`  
   **Output:** `Prediction: 0`, `Nodes: [0]`  
   **Explanation:** Pain is not greater than 4, so it's classified as non-surgical.
