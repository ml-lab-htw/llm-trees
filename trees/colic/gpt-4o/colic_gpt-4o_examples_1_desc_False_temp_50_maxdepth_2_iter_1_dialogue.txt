Below is the Python function for the decision tree that classifies whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the features `pain` (Degree of Pain) and `abdominal_distension` (Abdominal Distension) as the most important features. The function also returns the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize the list of truth values for inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # Degree of Pain: 1 (alert), 3 (depressed), 4 (intermittent mild pain), 5 (intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 2  # Abdominal Distension: 1 (moderate), 2 (none), 3 (severe), 4 (slight)

    if nodes[0]:  # If Degree of Pain is <= 3 (alert or depressed)
        if nodes[1]:  # If Abdominal Distension is > 2 (severe or slight)
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension is <= 2 (moderate or none)
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # Degree of Pain is > 3 (intermittent mild or severe pain)
        prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Inputs:**
   - The input `X` is a dictionary where the keys correspond to the feature names (e.g., `"pain"`, `"abdominal_distension"`) and the values are the feature values for a specific case.

2. **Nodes:**
   - `nodes[0]` evaluates whether the `pain` feature (Degree of Pain) is less than or equal to 3 (alert or depressed).
   - `nodes[1]` evaluates whether the `abdominal_distension` feature (Abdominal Distension) is greater than 2 (severe or slight).

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - If `pain` is less than or equal to 3:
     - If `abdominal_distension` is greater than 2, the lesion is classified as surgical (`1`).
     - Otherwise, it is classified as non-surgical (`0`).
   - If `pain` is greater than 3, the lesion is classified as surgical (`1`).

4. **Outputs:**
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: The classification (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes, where `1` indicates the condition was satisfied and `0` indicates it was not.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3  # Severe abdominal distension
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Thresholds and Feature Encodings:
- **`pain`:** Encodes the degree of pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain). The threshold of `3` distinguishes between lower levels of pain (non-surgical) and higher levels (potentially surgical).
- **`abdominal_distension`:** Encodes the level of abdominal distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight). The threshold of `2` distinguishes between less severe conditions (non-surgical) and more severe conditions (surgical).

This function is designed to be both interpretable and efficient for classifying horse colic lesions.
