```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # no surgery
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
- The decision tree is built with a maximum depth of 1 (one decision node).
- The most important feature I chose is `pain`, as the degree of pain could be an important indicator for whether surgery is needed or not.
- The condition checks whether the pain level is 3 or higher (which could indicate more severe conditions such as "depressed," "intermittent mild pain," or "intermittent severe pain"). If true, predict surgery (`1`), otherwise predict no surgery (`0`).
