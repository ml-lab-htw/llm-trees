    else:

        # Severe abdominal distension (3 = severe)
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Severe abdominal distension -> surgery
            prediction = 1

### Explanation:
1. **First Node** (`nodes[0]`): This checks if the horse is experiencing **severe pain** (either continuous or intermittent). If the pain is severe, surgery is likely required, so the tree predicts `1` (surgery).
2. **Second Node** (`nodes[1]`): If the pain is not severe, the decision is based on **abdominal distension**. If the distension is severe, the prediction is `1` (surgery). Otherwise, it predicts `0` (no surgery).

The function returns both the **prediction** and a list of **truth values** representing whether each condition in the decision nodes is satisfied.
