Based on your requirements and the example decision tree, I'll convert the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not into a Python function. This function will return the prediction and an array of truth values for the inner nodes of the tree. The decision tree is built based on key features identified previously, using meaningful values for thresholds derived from the given data.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Severe pain (2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # Severe abdominal distension (3 = severe)
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # Nasogastric Reflux (>1 liter)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_input = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 80,
    'respiratory_rate': 30,
    'temp_extremities': 2,
    'peripheral_pulse': 4,
    'mucous_membranes': 5,
    'capillary_refill_time': 0,
    'pain': 2,
    'peristalsis': 1,
    'abdominal_distension': 3,
    'nasogastric_tube': 2,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 7.5,
    'rectal_examination': 2,
    'abdomen': 1,
    'packed_cell_volume': 55,
    'total_protein': 7.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 3,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.5,
    'outcome': 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Surgical)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [True, True, True]

```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]**: Checks if the degree of pain is severe (2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain) – a critical indicator for surgical cases.
2. **nodes[1]**: Checks if abdominal distension is severe (3 = severe) – another critical indicator for surgical cases.
3. **nodes[2]**: Checks if nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter (0 = more than 1 liter) – indicating a surgical case.

The decision logic is based on these critical features:
- If the degree of pain is severe, it predicts a surgical lesion.
- If the pain is not severe but there is severe abdominal distension, it predicts a surgical lesion.
- If neither of the above is true but there is nasogastric reflux > 1 liter, it predicts a surgical lesion.
- Otherwise, it predicts a non-surgical lesion.

The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values (`nodes`) indicating whether each condition in the decision tree was met. This allows for traceability and debugging of the decision-making process.
