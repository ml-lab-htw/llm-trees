Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features provided. The function returns a prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of pain == 2 (continuous severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X['pain'] == 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Abdominal Distension == 3 (severe)
        nodes[1] = X['abdominal_distension'] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Prediction: Surgery required
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Prediction: Surgery required (Severe pain with non-severe distension still likely surgical)
            prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 2: Nasogastric Reflux == 0 (more than 1 liter)
        nodes[2] = X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0
        
        if nodes[2]:
            # Node 3: Abdominal Distension == 3 (severe)
            nodes[3] = X['abdominal_distension'] == 3
            
            if nodes[3]:
                # Prediction: Surgery required
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Node 4: Nasogastric Reflux pH <= 5.0
                nodes[4] = X['nasogastric_reflux_PH'] <= 5.0
                
                if nodes[4]:
                    # Prediction: Surgery required
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    # Prediction: No surgery required
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 5: Peristalsis == 1 (absent)
            nodes[5] = X['peristalsis'] == 1
            
            if nodes[5]:
                # Node 6: Mucous Membranes == 5 (pale cyanotic)
                nodes[6] = X['mucous_membranes'] == 5
                
                if nodes[6]:
                    # Prediction: Surgery required (absent peristalsis and pale cyanotic membranes)
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    # Prediction: No surgery required
                    prediction = 0
            else:
                # Prediction: No surgery required (Normal or hypermotile peristalsis)
                prediction = 0
    
    # Return the prediction and the list of truth values for each node
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree Logic:
1. **Node 0 (pain)**: If the horse is experiencing continuous severe pain (`pain == 2`), this is a strong indicator of a surgical lesion. If true, the next check is abdominal distension.
2. **Node 1 (abdominal_distension)**: If the distension is severe (`abdominal_distension == 3`), surgery is very likely required. Even if the distension isn't severe, severe pain alone likely indicates surgery.
3. **Node 2 (nasogastric_reflux)**: If the horse is not in severe pain, then the amount of nasogastric reflux is important. If more than 1 liter of reflux is present (`nasogastric_reflux == 0`), there might be a blockage.
4. **Node 3 (abdominal_distension)**: If there is a large amount of reflux and severe abdominal distension, surgery is required.
5. **Node 4 (nasogastric_reflux_PH)**: If there is a large amount of reflux but no severe distension, check the pH of the reflux. A pH â‰¤ 5.0 suggests acidic content, indicating potential blockage and thus surgical need.
6. **Node 5 (peristalsis)**: If there is less than 1 liter of reflux or none at all, the absence of peristaltic sounds (`peristalsis == 1`) is concerning and might indicate a surgical condition.
7. **Node 6 (mucous_membranes)**: If peristalsis is absent and the mucous membranes are pale cyanotic (`mucous_membranes == 5`), this indicates poor circulation and a likely surgical case.

The function returns both the prediction (`0` for no surgery, `1` for surgery) and a list (`nodes`) of boolean values corresponding to whether each condition in the tree was met.
