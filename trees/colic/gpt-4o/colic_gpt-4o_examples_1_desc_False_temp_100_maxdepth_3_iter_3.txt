Here is a decision tree based on the Features and target variable you provided, with a maximum depth of 3. The tree will predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check Packed Cell Volume
    nodes[0] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check Abdominocentesis Appearance
        nodes[1] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 2  # cloudy
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:
            # Node 2: Check Peristalsis
            nodes[2] = X["peristalsis"] in [1, 2]  # Absent or Hypermotile
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        # Node 1: Check Abdominal Distension
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # Severe
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:
            # Node 2: Check Nasogastric Reflux
            nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # More than 1 liter
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the **Packed Cell Volume** is greater than 45. This feature could indicate dehydration or other conditions that suggest surgery might be required.
   
   - If `True` (Packed Cell Volume > 45), the tree moves to Node 1.
   - If `False`, the tree moves to a different Node 1.

2. **Node 1 (when Packed Cell Volume > 45)**: The next condition checks if the **Abdominocentesis Appearance** is cloudy (value 2). A cloudy appearance could indicate infection or other serious internal issues.
   
   - If `True` (Cloudy Abdominocentesis Appearance), the prediction is surgery (1).
   - If `False`, it moves to Node 2.

3. **Node 2 (when Packed Cell Volume > 45 and Abdominocentesis is not cloudy)**: The tree checks if **Peristalsis** is either absent (1) or hypermotile (2). These conditions might suggest a serious digestive issue requiring surgery.
   
   - If `True`, the prediction is surgery (1).
   - If `False`, the prediction is no surgery (0).

4. **Node 1 (when Packed Cell Volume <= 45)**: If Packed Cell Volume is not greater than 45, the tree checks if **Abdominal Distension** is severe (value 3), which could indicate a blockage or other issue that might require surgery.
   
   - If `True` (Severe Abdominal Distension), the prediction is surgery (1).
   - If `False`, the tree moves to Node 2.

5. **Node 2 (when Packed Cell Volume <= 45 and Abdominal Distension is not severe)**: Finally, the tree checks if **Nasogastric Reflux** is more than 1 liter (value 0). This might suggest a serious gastrointestinal issue.
   
   - If `True`, the prediction is surgery (1).
   - If `False`, the prediction is no surgery (0).

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {
    "packed_cell_volume": 40,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 3 and uses important features from the dataset you provided. You can adjust the thresholds and feature choices depending on your understanding of the problem domain!
