Based on the given decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0) based on input features.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values for a single instance. 
                  Keys must match the exact feature names provided.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 for not surgical, 1 for surgical.
            - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain <= moderate (encoded as 4 or less)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # 4 = "intermittent mild pain"
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain <= moderate
        # Node 1: Abdominal Distension <= slight (encoded as 4 or less)
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # 4 = "slight"
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension <= slight
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension > slight
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:  # Degree of Pain > moderate
        # Node 1: Nasogastric Reflux > none (encoded as > 3)
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 3  # 3 = 0
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Nasogastric Reflux > none
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # Nasogastric Reflux <= none
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Node 0**: The decision starts with the feature `"pain"`. If the degree of pain is less than or equal to `"moderate"` (encoded as 4 or less), we proceed to the next condition. Otherwise, we branch to the right.

2. **Node 1 (Left Branch)**: If the pain is less than or equal to moderate, the next condition checks `"abdominal_distension"`. If the distension is less than or equal to `"slight"` (encoded as 4 or less), the prediction is `0` (not surgical). Otherwise, the prediction is `1` (surgical).

3. **Node 1 (Right Branch)**: If the pain is greater than moderate, the next condition checks `"nasogastric_reflux"`. If the reflux is greater than `"none"` (encoded as greater than 3), the prediction is `1` (surgical). Otherwise, the prediction is `0` (not surgical).

4. **Truth Values (`nodes`)**: The `nodes` list captures the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]`: Truth value of the condition `"pain" <= moderate`.
   - `nodes[1]`: Truth value of the condition in the respective branch:
     - Left branch: `"abdominal_distension" <= slight`.
     - Right branch: `"nasogastric_reflux" > none`.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 3,  # Depressed
    "abdominal_distension": 4,  # Slight
    "nasogastric_reflux": 2  # Missing
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Not surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

This function adheres to the provided specifications and uses meaningful threshold values for the decision tree conditions.
