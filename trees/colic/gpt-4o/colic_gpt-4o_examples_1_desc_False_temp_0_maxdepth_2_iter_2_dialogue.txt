Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the features `pain` and `abdominal_distension` to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if pain is less than or equal to 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # pain <= mild
    
    # Node 1: Check if abdominal_distension is less than or equal to 4 (slight)
    if not nodes[0]:  # If pain > mild
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # abdominal_distension <= slight
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated if Node 0 is True

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # pain <= mild
        prediction = 0  # not surgical
    else:  # pain > mild
        if nodes[1]:  # abdominal_distension <= slight
            prediction = 0  # not surgical
        else:  # abdominal_distension > slight
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the `pain` feature is less than or equal to 4 (intermittent mild pain). If this condition is satisfied, the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (0).
2. **Node 1**: If the `pain` condition is not satisfied (i.e., `pain > mild`), the second condition checks if the `abdominal_distension` feature is less than or equal to 4 (slight). If this condition is satisfied, the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (0). Otherwise, it is classified as **surgical** (1).
3. **Truth Values**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes. `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first condition (`pain <= mild`), and `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second condition (`abdominal_distension <= slight`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 5,  # intermittent severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # severe
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds for `pain` and `abdominal_distension` were chosen based on the feature descriptions and the decision tree logic.
- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with the correct spelling and case. Missing or misspelled keys will result in a `KeyError`.
