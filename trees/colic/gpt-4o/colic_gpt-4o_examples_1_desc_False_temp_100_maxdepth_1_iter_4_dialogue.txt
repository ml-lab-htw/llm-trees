Here’s how the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (target: 0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) can be implemented as a Python function using the feature "pain” (Degree of Pain):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # We have only 1 decision node since depth = 1.
    
    # Decision rule for the tree.
    # pain in {2, 5} (corresponding to severe pain): surgery is required.
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # 'continuous severe pain' or 'intermittent severe pain'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature selection**:
   - The feature `"pain"` (Degree of Pain) is used as the single decision point because severe pain is often associated with the need for surgery. The possible values for this feature are:
     - 1 = alert
     - 2 = continuous severe pain
     - 3 = depressed
     - 4 = intermittent mild pain
     - 5 = intermittent severe pain
   - Surgery is predicted when the pain is either `continuous severe pain (2)` or `intermittent severe pain (5)`.

2. **Inner Nodes**:
   - Since the decision tree has a depth of 1, it only has 1 node. The `nodes` list contains this node's condition truth value:
     - `nodes[0]` will be `1` if the condition `X["pain"] in [2, 5]` is **true**, otherwise `0`.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (condition satisfied), the prediction is `1` (surgical).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (condition not satisfied), the prediction is `0` (non-surgical).
