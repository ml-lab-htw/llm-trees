Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree based on a maximum depth of 4, following the JSON-style formatting, the keys provided in the feature list, and encoding details you shared. The function includes both the prediction and truth values for inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to hold truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Node conditions (inner nodes of the decision tree)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 4  # Degree of Pain: severe or moderate (>= 4 indicates potential for surgery)
    nodes[1] = X["peristalsis"] != 4  # Peristalsis not normal (any value other than 4 indicates abnormal peristalsis)
    nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Abdominal Distension: severe or moderate (1 or 3 indicate surgical signs)
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45  # Packed Cell Volume > 45 (high PCV can indicate complications)

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Pain is severe or moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # Peristalsis is abnormal
            if nodes[2]:  # Abdominal Distension is severe or moderate
                if nodes[3]:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
    else:  # Pain is mild or none
        prediction = 0  # Not surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the degree of pain (feature "pain") is severe (>= 4). Severe or moderate pain is typically a strong indicator of surgical necessity. Encodings suggest "intermittent mild pain" (4) or worse could be an issue.
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if peristalsis (feature "peristalsis") is not normal (`!= 4`). Abnormal peristalsis often indicates intestinal dysfunction.
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if abdominal distension (feature "abdominal_distension") is severe or moderate (encoded as 1 or 3). These values are associated with conditions requiring surgery.
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if packed cell volume (feature "packed_cell_volume") is greater than 45. A high PCV indicates dehydration or complications, common with severe colic.

2. **Tree Structure**:
   - The tree starts by evaluating the degree of pain, then uses peristalsis abnormalities, abdominal distension, and packed cell volume to differentiate between surgical and non-surgical cases.
   - If the conditions lead to a classification of surgical (1) or not surgical (0), the final prediction reflects the outcome.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns two values:
     - `prediction`: The final classification result (1 = surgical, 0 = not surgical).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1=True` or `0=False`) for each decision in the tree.

### Example Input/Output:

Input:
```python
X = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.0,
    "pulse": 72,
    "respiratory_rate": 30,
    "temp_extremities": 1,
    "peripheral_pulse": 4,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 5,
    "peristalsis": 1,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_tube": 2,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7.2,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 2,
    "packed_cell_volume": 50,
    "total_protein": 7.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 3,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.5,
    "outcome": 3
}
```

Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# prediction = 1 (Surgical case)
# nodes = [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This output indicates a surgical case with all the tree conditions satisfied (`True`).
