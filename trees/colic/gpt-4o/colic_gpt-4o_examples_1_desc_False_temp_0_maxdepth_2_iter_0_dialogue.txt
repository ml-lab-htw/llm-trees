Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and it uses the features `pain` and `abdominal_distension` to make predictions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 if the lesion is not surgical, 1 if the lesion is surgical.
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Degree of Pain is <= 4 (intermittent mild pain or less)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # pain: 1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain is <= 4
        prediction = 0  # Not surgical
    else:  # Degree of Pain is > 4
        # Node 1: Check if Abdominal Distension is <= 2 (none or slight)
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension is <= 2
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension is > 2
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the `pain` feature.
   - If `pain` is less than or equal to 4 (intermittent mild pain or less), the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
   - Otherwise, the decision proceeds to the next node.

2. **Node 1**: The second decision is based on the `abdominal_distension` feature.
   - If `abdominal_distension` is less than or equal to 2 (none or slight), the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
   - Otherwise, the lesion is classified as **surgical** (`prediction = 1`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 5,  # intermittent severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # severe
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0, 0]
```

### Notes:
- The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `X["pain"] <= 4`.
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`).
- The function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the correct spelling and encoding.
