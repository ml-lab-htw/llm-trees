Here is the requested Python function for the provided decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or non-surgical (0). The function uses the given features, and the thresholds are filled in with clinically meaningful values based on the feature descriptions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or non-surgical (0).

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values, keys being the feature names as described.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 (non-surgical) or 1 (surgical).
        nodes (list[int]): A list of truth values (0 or 1) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """

    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values for each decision node.

    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 4  # Degree of pain > mild (4)
    nodes[1] = X["rectal_temperature"] > 38.5  # Fever if temperature > 38.5°C
    nodes[2] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] > 1  # Appearance not clear (cloudy or serosanguinous)
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45  # Packed Cell Volume > 45%

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Fever
            if nodes[2]:  # Abdominocentesis appearance not clear
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:  # Clear abdominocentesis appearance
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:  # No fever
            if nodes[3]:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 45
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # Mild or no pain
        if X["abdominal_distension"] > 3:  # Abdominal distension > slight (3 = severe or moderate)
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # Abdominal distension slight or none
            if X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 3:  # Nasogastric reflux present (more than "none")
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:  # Nasogastric reflux "none"
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **`nodes[0]`:** Checks if the degree of pain is greater than "mild" (value 4), indicating severe pain, which strongly suggests surgery.
2. **`nodes[1]`:** Checks if the rectal temperature is greater than 38.5°C, indicating a fever or systemic infection.
3. **`nodes[2]`:** Checks if the appearance of the abdominocentesis fluid is not clear, indicating signs of infection or significant inflammation (likely surgical).
4. **`nodes[3]`:** Checks if the packed cell volume (PCV) is greater than 45%, indicating dehydration or blood loss, commonly associated with surgical cases.

The tree then evaluates the input through these decision nodes to decide if the case is surgical (1) or non-surgical (0). It also returns the truth values from the decision nodes for transparency.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 5,                          # Severe intermittent pain
    "rectal_temperature": 39.0,         # High fever
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2,   # Cloudy fluid
    "packed_cell_volume": 50,           # Elevated PCV
    "abdominal_distension": 4,          # Severe distension
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0             # Nasogastric reflux > 1 liter
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
``` 

### Output:
For the provided example:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```

Here, the prediction is `1` (surgical), and the truth values of the nodes represent which conditions of the decision tree were met.
