Here is the required function to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, formatted as described:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in ["intermittent mild pain", "alert"]
    nodes[1] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 40

    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain is none or mild
        prediction = 0  # not surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 40
            prediction = 0  # not surgical
        else:  # Packed Cell Volume > 40
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**:
    - The first condition checks the `pain` level. If the pain is "intermittent mild pain" or "alert", it is considered `none or mild`, hence the lesion is predicted as `not surgical`.

2. **Node 1**:
    - If the `pain` is not "intermittent mild pain" or "alert", we move to the next condition which checks the `packed_cell_volume`.
    - If `packed_cell_volume` is less than or equal to 40%, the lesion is `not surgical`.
    - If `packed_cell_volume` is greater than 40%, the lesion is `surgical`.

### How to Use the Function:
You can use this function by passing a dictionary representing a horse's medical data to it.

Example:

```python
X = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 60,
    "respiratory_rate": 16,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": "continuous severe pain",
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 42,
    "total_protein": 6.8,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 2.1,
    "outcome": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

- **Prediction**: This will output whether the colic lesion is surgical (1) or not surgical (0).
- **Nodes**: This will output a list of truth values corresponding to the conditions at each decision node in the tree.

In this example, `X["pain"]` is "continuous severe pain" (which is not "intermittent mild pain" or "alert"), and `X["packed_cell_volume"]` is 42, which is greater than 40. Hence `nodes[0]` will be `False` and `nodes[1]` will be `False`, leading to a prediction of `1` (surgical).
