Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (`0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery`) and returns the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 1: Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 4  # Pain greater than "intermittent mild pain" is considered severe
    
    # Inner node 2: Abdominal Distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 3  # Abdominal distension greater than "slight" is considered significant
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 3  # Nasogastric reflux greater than "none" is significant

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Significant abdominal distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical lesion
    else:  # Mild or no pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Significant nasogastric reflux
            prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical lesion

    # Return the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Node 1 (`nodes[0]`)**: Checks if the degree of pain is greater than `4` (intermittent mild pain). Severe pain is a strong indicator of a surgical lesion.
2. **Node 2 (`nodes[1]`)**:
   - If the pain is severe (`nodes[0] = True`), it checks whether the abdominal distension is greater than `3` (slight). Moderate or severe distension suggests a surgical lesion.
   - If the pain is mild or absent (`nodes[0] = False`), it checks whether the nasogastric reflux is greater than `3` (none). Significant nasogastric reflux is a sign of a surgical lesion.
3. **Prediction**: Based on the conditions of the two nodes, the function predicts whether the lesion is surgical (`1`) or non-surgical (`0`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 5,  # Intermittent severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # Severe distension
    "nasogastric_reflux": 2  # Significant reflux
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Surgical lesion)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
