Here is the decision tree implementation as a Python function, built based on the descriptions and thresholds provided for the horse colic classification task. It uses the requested input format and outputs a prediction, as well as a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

---

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict if a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values with the exact keys provided.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 (no surgery) or 1 (surgery).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner decision nodes.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic using the most relevant features:
    
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 3  # Severe or moderate pain (threshold 3) might indicate surgery
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["abdomen"] in [1, 2]  # Distended abdomen (large or small)
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # More than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux
            if nodes[2]:
                nodes[3] = X["rectal_examination"] == 1  # Absent rectal findings
                if nodes[3]:
                    nodes[4] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3  # Serosanguinous fluid
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Surgery
                    else:

        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] < 40  # Packed cell volume below a dangerous threshold
            if nodes[3]:
                nodes[4] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1  # Quick capillary refill time (< 3 seconds)
                if nodes[4]:

### Explanation of Logic:

- **Nodes[0]:** Check if the horse experiences moderate or more severe pain (`pain >= 3`). Severe pain often suggests a surgical colic lesion.
- **Nodes[1]:** Check if the abdomen is distended (`abdomen in [1, 2]`, i.e., large or small intestine distension). Such distension typically indicates a potential need for surgery.
- **Nodes[2]:** Evaluate if more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux is detected (`nasogastric_reflux == 0`), as this can indicate a blockage requiring surgery.
- **Nodes[3]:** If no rectal findings are observed (`rectal_examination == 1`), this might further confirm the need for surgery in challenging cases.
- **Nodes[4]:** Check if serosanguinous abdominal fluid is found (`abdominocentesis_appearance == 3`), often a strong indication for surgery.

If none of these critical conditions is satisfied, the tree branches into circumstances where no surgery is required, such as normal vital signs or less severe diagnostic signs.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Input example (replace with actual feature values):
X = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.2,
    'pulse': 85,
    'respiratory_rate': 20,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 4,
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 3,
    'nasogastric_tube': 2,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 4.0,
    'rectal_examination': 1,
    'abdomen': 1,
    'packed_cell_volume': 50,
    'total_protein': 7.0,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 3,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 3.5,
    'outcome': 3
}

# Predict using the function:
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgery likely needed)
print("Inner Node Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
