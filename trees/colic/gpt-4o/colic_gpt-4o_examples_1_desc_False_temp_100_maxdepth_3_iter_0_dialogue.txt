Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (`1`) or not (`0`). The function takes a dictionary `X` where keys are feature names (as given in the dataset) and values are the corresponding observations. It returns the prediction and a list of truth values for the decision tree's inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to store truth values for inner nodes
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Decision tree logic
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain (pain == 5, 2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X['pain'] in [2, 5]

    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        # Node 1: Abdominocentesis Appearance (abdominocentesis_appearance == 3, 3 = serosanguinous)
        nodes[1] = X['abdominocentesis_appearance'] == 3

        if nodes[1]:  # Serosanguinous fluid in abdominal tap
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            # Node 2: Rectal Examination Findings (rectal_examination == 2, 3 = increased, 2 = decreased)
            nodes[2] = X['rectal_examination'] == 2

            if nodes[2]:  # Findings indicative of small intestine distention
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Inner Nodes:**
   - **Node 0:** Checks whether the degree of pain (`pain`) is `2` (continuous severe pain) or `5` (intermittent severe pain). If true, it is classified as surgical.
   - **Node 1:** If the pain is not severe, examine the appearance of abdominocentesis fluid (`abdominocentesis_appearance`). If it is `3` (serosanguinous), classify as surgical.
   - **Node 2:** If neither of the above conditions is true, check the findings from a rectal examination (`rectal_examination`). If the findings indicate a distended small intestine (`rectal_examination == 2`, i.e., decreased), classify as surgical.

2. **Truth Values:**
   - The `nodes` list stores the logical outcomes for each of the three inner nodes. It will contain `1` for a node where the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

3. **Prediction:**
   - The final classification decision is based on traversing the tree using the feature values in the input `X`.

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    'pain': 5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'rectal_examination': 2
}
```

### Example Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, False, True]
```

### Key Points:
- This tree has a depth of 3 with three decision nodes.
- The feature names in `X` must match exactly as defined in the dataset (`pain`, `abdominocentesis_appearance`, and `rectal_examination`).
- Predictions are binary: `1` indicates the lesion is surgical, while `0` indicates it is not.
