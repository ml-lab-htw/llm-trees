Here is a decision tree function based on the Features and target variable you provided. The tree has a maximum depth of 5 and uses the most important features to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Nasogastric Reflux
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # more than 1 liter
    
    # Node 1: Rectal Examination
    nodes[1] = X["rectal_examination"] == 1  # absent
    
    # Node 2: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # severe
    
    # Node 3: Peristalsis
    nodes[3] = X["peristalsis"] == 1  # absent
    
    # Node 4: Pain
    nodes[4] = X["pain"] == 2  # continuous severe pain
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # surgery
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # no surgery
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # no surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the amount of nasogastric reflux. If it is more than 1 liter (`nasogastric_reflux == 0`), we proceed to the next decision.
   
2. **Node 1**: The second decision checks the rectal examination. If rectal examination findings are absent (`rectal_examination == 1`), we continue further.

3. **Node 2**: The third decision is based on the severity of abdominal distension. If it is severe (`abdominal_distension == 3`), we check the next condition.

4. **Node 3**: The fourth node evaluates peristalsis. If peristalsis is absent (`peristalsis == 1`), we look at the next feature.

5. **Node 4**: The last decision checks for continuous severe pain (`pain == 2`). This is the final factor in determining if surgery is needed or not.

The tree structure allows for different paths, and based on the conditions at each node, it predicts whether surgery is required (1) or not (0). The function also returns a list (`nodes`) with the truth values of each node condition, where `1` means the condition is satisfied and `0` means it is not.
