Here is a decision tree of depth 2 based on the Features you provided, with a maximum of 3 inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["rectal_temperature"] <= 38.0
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 2  # Pain level <= 2: more severe pain (alert or continuous severe pain)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery is required
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0:** The first condition checks if the rectal temperature is less than or equal to 38.0Â°C. A lower temperature might indicate a more serious condition that could require surgery.
- **Node 1:** The second condition checks if the pain level is less than or equal to 2 (either "alert" or "continuous severe pain"). Severe pain could be an indicator for surgery.

This decision tree is designed to make a prediction on whether surgery is required based on these two important factors: rectal temperature and pain level.
