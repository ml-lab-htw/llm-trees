Based on the detailed instructions and feature set provided, here is a Python function implementing the requested decision tree algorithm. The function predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or non-surgical (0).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # List of truth values for the inner nodes (max depth = 5).

    # Node conditions:
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # Degree of Pain: moderate or less (3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, etc.)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # Abdominal Distension: slight or none. (2 = none, 4 = slight).
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1  # Capillary Refill Time: < 3 seconds.
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 3  # Nasogastric Reflux: reflux present (3 = none, so this checks for >3).
    nodes[4] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45  # Packed Cell Volume: value above a critical threshold (>=45%).
    nodes[5] = X["rectal_temperature"] > 38  # Rectal Temperature: higher than a normal value (>38°C).
    nodes[6] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] > 1  # Abdominocentesis Appearance: cloudy or serosanguinous.

    # Decision Tree logic:
    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain <= moderate.
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension <= slight.
            if nodes[2]:  # Capillary Refill Time < 3 seconds.
                prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical case.
            else:  # Capillary Refill Time >= 3 seconds.
                prediction = 1  # Surgical case.
        else:  # Abdominal Distension > slight.
            if nodes[3]:  # Nasogastric Reflux > none.
                prediction = 1  # Surgical case.
            else:  # Nasogastric Reflux = none.
                prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical case.
    else:  # Degree of Pain > moderate.
        if nodes[4]:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45%.
            if nodes[6]:  # Abdominocentesis Appearance > clear (cloudy or serosanguinous).
                prediction = 1  # Surgical case.
            else:  # Abdominocentesis Appearance = clear.
                prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical case.
        else:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 45%.
            if nodes[5]:  # Rectal Temperature > 38°C.
                prediction = 1  # Surgical case.
            else:  # Rectal Temperature <= 38°C.
                prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical case.

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Format**:
   - The input `X` is a dictionary with keys corresponding to the features provided in the `Features` section of your question.
   - Each value in `X` is the specific feature value for the horse being evaluated.

2. **Node Conditions**:
   - The conditions in the `nodes` list correspond to the inner nodes of the decision tree.
   - Each entry in the `nodes` list is a `True` (1) or `False` (0) value indicating whether the condition for that node is satisfied.

3. **Decision Tree Structure**:
   - The decision tree is implemented as a series of nested `if` statements.
   - At each conditional branch (`if nodes[X]`), the tree evaluates whether the condition is met and proceeds to the appropriate sub-branch.

4. **Terminal Nodes**:
   - The decision tree returns a prediction of `1` (surgical) or `0` (non-surgical) at its terminal nodes.

5. **Feature Thresholds**:
   - The thresholds are based on reasonable assumptions or domain knowledge for each feature:
     - `pain <= 3`: Moderate or less severe pain.
     - `abdominal_distension <= 4`: Slight or no abdominal distension.
     - `capillary_refill_time == 1`: Indicates adequate circulation.
     - `nasogastric_reflux > 3`: Presence of reflux.
     - `packed_cell_volume > 45`: Indicative of dehydration or severe conditions.
     - `rectal_temperature > 38`: Elevated temperature may suggest infection/inflammation.
     - `abdominocentesis_appearance > 1`: Abnormal fluid appearance.

6. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns two values:
     - `prediction`: The binary classification (`0` for non-surgical, `1` for surgical).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` or `0`) for each inner node condition in the decision tree.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Input features for a horse
horse_features = {
    "pain": 2,
    "abdominal_distension": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "packed_cell_volume": 46,
    "rectal_temperature": 37.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2,
}

# Predict using the decision tree function
prediction, nodes = predict(horse_features)

print("Prediction (1 = surgical, 0 = non-surgical):", prediction)
print("Truth values for inner nodes:", nodes)
```

### Expected Output for Example:
If `horse_features` corresponds to the above example:
```plaintext
Prediction (1 = surgical, 0 = non-surgical): 1
Truth values for inner nodes: [True, True, True, False, True, False, True]
```
