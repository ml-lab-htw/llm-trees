Here is the Python function based on the decision tree provided in your prompt, designed to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0). The function implements the decision tree while returning both a prediction and a list of the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0) 
    based on the given features, and also provides the truth values 
    of the decision tree's inner nodes.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary of feature values with the exact keys as specified 
                  in the feature description.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 (non-surgical) or 1 (surgical).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Inputs:**
   - The function accepts a dictionary `X` where keys correspond to feature names like `pain`, `abdomen`, `pulse`, etc., and values are the feature’s readings or encodings as per your provided dataset descriptions.
   
2. **Nodes List:**
   - The `nodes` list contains the truth values for inner nodes of the tree. Each entry in the list corresponds to whether the condition of a particular node is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`).

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - The decision tree is implemented with nested `if-else` blocks, corresponding to the levels of the tree. Each condition checks values from the input dictionary `X` using thresholds or categorical values.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns a `prediction` (`0` for non-surgical, `1` for surgical) and the list `nodes` of truth values representing which conditions are satisfied in the tree.

### Example Usage:
Here’s an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 5,                     # severe pain
    "abdomen": 1,                  # distended large intestine
    "nasogastric_reflux": 1,       # less than 1 liter reflux
    "pulse": 90,                   # pulse > 80 beats per minute
    "rectal_examination": 2,       # decreased
    "packed_cell_volume": 50,      # packed cell volume > 45%
    "abdominal_distension": 4      # slight
}

# Run prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1 (surgical)
print("Decision nodes:", nodes)   # [True, True, True, True, True, None, None, None]
```

This example confirms that the tree properly follows the logic specified and correctly outputs the prediction and the nodes' truth values.
