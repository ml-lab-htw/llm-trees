Based on the provided feature information and the proposed decision tree structure, here is the implementation of the decision tree classifier in a Python function. 

I'll consider meaningful thresholds for the features `Degree of Pain` and `Abdominal Distension`, encoded as the `pain` and `abdominal_distension` features respectively:

- `Degree of Pain` thresholds: severe (encoded as 2 and 5)
- `Abdominal Distension` thresholds: severe or moderate (encoded as 1 and 3)

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for the decision tree nodes
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Severe pain: 'continuous severe pain' or 'intermittent severe pain'
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Severe or moderate abdominal distension

    # Determine prediction based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        # If severe pain, predict surgery
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If not severe pain but severe/moderate distension, predict surgery
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict non-surgical
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# features = {
#    'surgery': 2, 'Age': 0, 'rectal_temperature': 37.8, 'pulse': 80, 'respiratory_rate': 20,
#    'temp_extremities': 3, 'peripheral_pulse': 3, 'mucous_membranes': 4, 'capillary_refill_time': 1,
#    'pain': 2, 'peristalsis': 4, 'abdominal_distension': 1, 'nasogastric_tube': 1, 'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
#    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 7.0, 'rectal_examination': 4, 'abdomen': 4, 'packed_cell_volume': 40,
#    'total_protein': 7.0, 'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1, 'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 3.0,
#    'outcome': 3
# }
# prediction, nodes = predict(features)
# print(f'Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}')
```

This function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing feature values, evaluates the conditions at each decision node (represented as elements in the `nodes` list), and returns the predicted class (`0` for no surgery, `1` for surgery) along with the list of truth values for the conditions at the nodes.
