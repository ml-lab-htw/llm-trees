Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (`0` for non-surgical, `1` for surgical). The tree logic follows the structure previously described and is formatted as a set of conditions. Additionally, a list `nodes` keeps track of the truth values of the inner nodes, which are `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # List to store truth values of inner nodes (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = not satisfied)
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Degree of Pain severe
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2  # 2 represents "continuous severe pain"

    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain severe
        # Node 1: Abdominal Distension severe
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # 3 represents "severe"
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension severe
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension not severe
            # Node 2: Nasogastric Reflux significant
            nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # 0 represents "> 1 liter"
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Nasogastric Reflux significant
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:  # Nasogastric Reflux not significant
                # Node 3: Packed Cell Volume > 45
                nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
                
                if nodes[3]:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45
                    prediction = 1  # surgical
                else:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 45
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # Degree of Pain not severe
        # Node 4: Abdominocentesis Appearance serosanguinous
        nodes[4] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3  # 3 represents "serosanguinous"
        
        if nodes[4]:  # Abdominocentesis Appearance serosanguinous
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # Abdominocentesis Appearance not serosanguinous
            # Node 2: Nasogastric Reflux significant
            nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # 0 represents "> 1 liter"

            if nodes[2]:  # Nasogastric Reflux significant
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:  # Nasogastric Reflux not significant
                # Node 1: Abdominal Distension moderate
                nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 1  # 1 represents "moderate"
                
                if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension moderate
                    prediction = 1  # surgical
                else:  # Abdominal Distension not moderate
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. `X`: The input is a dictionary where keys correspond to feature names (e.g., `pain`, `abdominal_distension`, etc.), and values represent the values for those features.
2. `nodes`: A list of size `5` that stores whether each inner node's condition is satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`). The indices of the nodes correspond to the decisions made in the tree.
3. Each decision node uses a specific feature and threshold (either categorical values or numeric thresholds) to partition the data:
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the Degree of Pain is severe (`pain == 2`).
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the Abdominal Distension is severe (`abdominal_distension == 3`) or moderate (`abdominal_distension == 1`).
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the Nasogastric Reflux is significant (`nasogastric_reflux == 0` for more than 1 liter).
    - `nodes[3]`: Checks if the Packed Cell Volume is greater than 45.
    - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the Abdominocentesis Appearance is serosanguinous (`abdominocentesis_appearance == 3`).

4. The decision tree is implemented using nested conditionals (`if`, `else`), ensuring that at most five decisions (depth of 5) are evaluated for each prediction.

5. The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The final classification (0 = non-surgical, 1 = surgical).
   - `nodes`: The list of truth values for the inner nodes, which can be used to trace how the prediction was made.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example feature dictionary
example_input = {
    "pain": 2,  # severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # severe distension
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # significant reflux
    "packed_cell_volume": 48,  # high PCV
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,  # clear
}

# Predicting
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, 1, None, None, None]
```

### Notes:
1. Make sure to input feature values using the encoding provided in the dataset description.
2. Missing values may require imputation or default assignments for this decision tree to handle gracefully.
