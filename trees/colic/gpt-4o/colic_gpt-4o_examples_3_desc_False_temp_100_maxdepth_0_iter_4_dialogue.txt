Based on the decision tree we constructed earlier for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, I'll format it as a Python function. This function will consider the most significant features, and it will return a prediction and a list of truth values for the conditions at each node. 

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # severe pain
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # moderate or severe distension
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Assuming input data is a dictionary, for instance:
X_example = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.3,
    "pulse": 72,
    "respiratory_rate": 30,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 2,  # severe pain
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # severe distension
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # more than 1 liter of reflux
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 6.5,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 7.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.0,
    "outcome": 3
}

# Prediction and conditions
predict(X_example)
```

### Explanation of the Nodes:
1. **nodes[0]**: Checks if the degree of pain is severe (values 2 or 5 from encoding).
2. **nodes[1]**: Checks if there is moderate (1) or severe (3) abdominal distension.
3. **nodes[2]**: Checks if there is more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux (value 0 from encoding).

### Output:
- The function returns `prediction` (1 for surgical, 0 for non-surgical).
- The `nodes` list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met.

Useful adjustments can be made as more specifics become available or as decision tree structures become more complex.
