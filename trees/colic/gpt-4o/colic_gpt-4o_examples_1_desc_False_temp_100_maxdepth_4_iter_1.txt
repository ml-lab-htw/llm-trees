Based on the Features and the target variable you provided (whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not), here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4. I've selected features that might have an important role in determining whether surgery is required or not, based on domain knowledge and logical assumptions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Node 0: Abdominal Distension might be a significant indicator for surgery.
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 2  # Severe or moderate distension

    # Node 1: Nasogastric Reflux could indicate a serious condition requiring surgery.
    nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # More than 1 liter

    # Node 2: Pain level might indicate the need for surgery if the pain is severe.
    nodes[2] = X["pain"] >= 4  # Severe or intermittent severe pain

    # Node 3: Peripheral Pulse could be important for assessing overall circulation.
    nodes[3] = X["peripheral_pulse"] == 1  # Absent pulse

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery required
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery required
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery required
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery required
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery required
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery required
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the severity of **abdominal distension**. If the abdominal distension is moderate or severe (value > 2), there's a higher chance surgery might be needed.
2. **Node 1**: If there is **nasogastric reflux** of more than 1 liter (nasogastric reflux = 0), this could indicate a serious issue that might require surgery.
3. **Node 2**: The **pain** level can be a strong indicator. Severe pain or intermittent severe pain (pain >= 4) could be a sign that surgery is necessary.
4. **Node 3**: The **peripheral pulse** being absent (peripheral_pulse = 1) may indicate poor circulation, which might increase the likelihood of surgery.

This function will return a prediction (1 for surgery, 0 for no surgery) along with a list of the truth values of the nodes used for decision-making.
