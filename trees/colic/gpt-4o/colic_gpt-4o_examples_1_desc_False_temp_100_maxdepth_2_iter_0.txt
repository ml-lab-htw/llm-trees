Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, based on the Features and prediction target (whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check if Packed Cell Volume is less than or equal to 45.
    nodes[0] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    # Node 2: Check if Pain is continuous severe pain or worse (i.e., Pain >= 2).
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] >= 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 1**: The first decision is based on the `"packed_cell_volume"` feature. If the packed cell volume is less than or equal to 45%, we go to Node 2. Otherwise, the prediction is 0 (no surgery).
   
2. **Node 2**: If the packed cell volume is less than or equal to 45%, the next decision is based on the `"pain"` feature. If the pain level is continuous severe (pain >= 2), surgery is predicted (prediction = 1). Otherwise, no surgery is predicted (prediction = 0).

### Features Used:
- **packed_cell_volume**: Packed Cell Volume is a measure of the proportion of blood that is composed of red blood cells. This is a crucial metric in determining the severity of colic.
- **pain**: Pain level is a significant indicator of whether surgery is required, with more severe pain indicating a higher likelihood of surgical intervention.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example feature input
X = {
    "packed_cell_volume": 46,
    "pain": 3,
    "rectal_temperature": 37.5,
    "respiratory_rate": 12,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    # ... other features can be included but are not used in this decision tree
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Inner Node Results: {nodes}")
```

This function will give a prediction of whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0), along with the truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
