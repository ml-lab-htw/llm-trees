Based on the Features and target variable you've provided, we will build a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 3, using the most relevant features. The decision tree will have between 3 and 7 inner nodes, and the structure will be formatted as a Python function.

### Features:
- `surgery`: (1 = no, 2 = yes)
- `Age`: (0 = adult, 1 = young)
- `rectal_temperature`: Rectal Temperature (°C)
- `pulse`: Pulse (beats per minute)
- `respiratory_rate`: Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute)
- `temp_extremities`: Temperature of Extremities (1 = cold, 2 = cool, 3 = normal, 4 = warm)
- `peripheral_pulse`: Strength of Peripheral Pulse (1 = absent, 2 = increased, 3 = normal, 4 = reduced)
- `mucous_membranes`: Appearance of Mucous Membranes (1 = bright pink, 2 = bright red, 3 = dark cyanotic, 4 = normal pink, 5 = pale cyanotic, 6 = pale pink)
- `capillary_refill_time`: Capillary Refill Time (0 = more than 3 seconds, 1 = less than 3 seconds, 2 = missing, 3 = meaning unknown)
- `pain`: Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
- `peristalsis`: (1 = absent, 2 = hypermotile, 3 = hypomotile, 4 = normal)
- `abdominal_distension`: (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
- `nasogastric_tube`: (1 = none, 2 = significant, 3 = slight)
- `nasogastric_reflux`: (0 = more than 1 liter, 1 = less than 1 liter, 2 = missing, 3 = none)
- `nasogastric_reflux_PH`: Nasogastric Reflux pH
- `rectal_examination`: Rectal Examination Findings (1 = absent, 2 = decreased, 3 = increased, 4 = normal)
- `abdomen`: Abdomen Appearance (1 = distended large, 2 = distended small, 3 = firm feces in large intestine, 4 = normal, 5 = other)
- `packed_cell_volume`: Packed Cell Volume (%)
- `total_protein`: Total Protein (g/dl)
- `abdominocentesis_appearance`: Abdominocentesis Appearance (1 = clear, 2 = cloudy, 3 = serosanguinous)
- `abdomcentesis_total_protein`: Abdominocentesis Total Protein (g/dl)
- `outcome`: Outcome (1 = died, 2 = euthanized, 3 = lived)

### Target variable:
- `target`: A horse colic lesion is surgical or not (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery)

### Decision Tree:
To construct the decision tree, I will use the most likely important features for determining surgical necessity based on medical intuition, such as `rectal_temperature`, `pain`, `nasogastric_reflux`, and `abdominal_distension`.

Here is the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize an array for nodes, where each entry corresponds to an internal decision node
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Maximum depth of 3
    
    # Node 1: Check if rectal temperature is below a threshold for surgical intervention
    nodes[0] = X["rectal_temperature"] < 38.5
    
    # Node 2: Check severity of pain if rectal temperature is normal
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["pain"] >= 4  # Severe pain (intermittent severe or continuous severe)
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # Nasogastric reflux more than 1 liter if temperature is low
    
    # Node 3: Check abdominal distension if temperature is high and pain is not severe
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:
        nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # Severe or moderate abdominal distension
    else:
        nodes[2] = X["total_protein"] < 7  # Low total protein level in blood if other conditions
    
    # Make final prediction based on the tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery if rectal temperature is low and nasogastric reflux is high
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery if severe pain or nasogastric reflux exceeds 1 liter
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery if severe abdominal distension
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery if none of the critical conditions are met

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 1 (`rectal_temperature`)**:
   - If the rectal temperature is below 38.5°C, this could be indicative of a more serious condition requiring surgery (e.g., hypothermia due to shock).
   
2. **Node 2** (depending on Node 1):
   - If the rectal temperature is not low, we check the severity of pain (`pain >= 4`), where 4 or 5 indicates severe pain. Severe pain is often associated with conditions requiring surgical intervention.
   - If the temperature is low, we check whether there is substantial nasogastric reflux (`nasogastric_reflux == 0`), which can indicate severe colic requiring surgery.

3. **Node 3** (depending on Node 2):
   - If the temperature is normal and pain is not severe, we check if there is severe abdominal distension (`abdominal_distension >= 3`), which can indicate a blockage or other issue requiring surgery.
   - If the temperature is low and nasogastric reflux is high, we check the `total_protein` level, as low protein levels can indicate poor prognosis and the need for surgery.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "rectal_temperature": 37.8,
    "pain": 5,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "total_protein": 6.8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output a prediction for whether surgery is needed (`1` for surgery, `0` for no surgery) and the truth values of the inner nodes (e.g., `[True, False, True]`).
