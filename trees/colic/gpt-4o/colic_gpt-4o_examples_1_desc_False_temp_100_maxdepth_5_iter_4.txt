Here is a Python function implementing a decision tree classifier of maximum depth 5 for the Features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Split on rectal_temperature
    nodes[0] = X["rectal_temperature"] <= 38.0

    # Node 1: Split on abdominal_distension
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 2

    # Node 2: Split on pulse
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80

    # Node 3: Split on nasogastric_reflux
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0

    # Node 4: Split on capillary_refill_time
    nodes[4] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Nodes:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the rectal temperature is <= 38.0Â°C. This could be an indicator of normal vs abnormal body temperature.
2. **Node 1**: Checks if the abdominal distension is greater than 2 (i.e., severe or moderate distension). Severe distension could indicate a condition requiring surgery.
3. **Node 2**: Checks if the pulse is <= 80 beats per minute. A lower pulse might indicate a more stable condition.
4. **Node 3**: Checks if nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter (coded as 0). Large amounts of nasogastric reflux could be a sign of a serious condition.
5. **Node 4**: Checks if capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds (coded as 0). This could indicate poor circulation, potentially requiring surgery.

### How the Function Works:
- The function takes a dictionary `X` of feature values as input.
- It evaluates the conditions of the 5 inner nodes and stores the results in the `nodes` list (with 1 if the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise).
- Based on the values of the `nodes`, the function follows the branches of the decision tree and returns a prediction (whether surgery is needed or not) and the list of node evaluations.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "surgery": 1,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 37.5,
    "pulse": 70,
    "respiratory_rate": 16,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 0,
    "pain": 2,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 6.5,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 7.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.0,
    "outcome": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This would return:
- `prediction`: 1 (Surgery needed)
- `nodes`: A list showing which conditions were satisfied at each inner node.
