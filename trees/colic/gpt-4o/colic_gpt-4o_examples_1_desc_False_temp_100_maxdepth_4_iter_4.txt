Here is an example decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 based on the Features you provided. The decision tree is designed for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery). The tree consists of 4 inner nodes and makes use of the most important features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if packed_cell_volume is above 40
    nodes[0] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 40  
    
    # Node 1: If packed_cell_volume is above 40, check if age is adult (0 = adult, 1 = young)
    nodes[1] = X["Age"] == 0  
    
    # Node 2: If packed_cell_volume is 40 or below, check if nasogastric_reflux_PH is less than 5
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux_PH"] < 5  
    
    # Node 3: If nasogastric_reflux_PH is less than 5, check if respiratory_rate is greater than 30
    nodes[3] = X["respiratory_rate"] > 30

    # Decision Logic
    if nodes[0]:  # packed_cell_volume > 40
        if nodes[1]:  # Age == adult
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:  # Age == young
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:  # packed_cell_volume <= 40
        if nodes[2]:  # nasogastric_reflux_PH < 5
            if nodes[3]:  # respiratory_rate > 30
                prediction = 1  # Surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:  # nasogastric_reflux_PH >= 5
            prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Decision Tree:
- **Node 0**: The first condition checks whether the `packed_cell_volume` is above 40%. High packed cell volume can indicate dehydration or other complications, which might lead to surgery.
- **Node 1**: If `packed_cell_volume` is high, the next check is whether the horse is an adult. If the horse is an adult, surgery is more likely.
- **Node 2**: If `packed_cell_volume` is low, the decision shifts to the `nasogastric_reflux_PH`. A pH less than 5 may indicate more severe gastrointestinal issues, leading to surgery.
- **Node 3**: If the pH is low, we check the `respiratory_rate`. A higher respiratory rate can indicate distress, which may require surgery.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "Age": 0,  # adult
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 4.5,
    "respiratory_rate": 35
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Surgery)
print("Node values:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, False, False]
```

### Node List:
- The `nodes` list will contain the truth values of the inner nodes. For example:
  - `nodes[0]`: Whether `packed_cell_volume` is above 40.
  - `nodes[1]`: Whether `Age` is adult.
  - `nodes[2]`: Whether `nasogastric_reflux_PH` is less than 5.
  - `nodes[3]`: Whether `respiratory_rate` is greater than 30.
