### Explanation:

1. **Node 0:** Checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain (either continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain). If yes, predicts surgery.
2. **Node 1:** If there's no severe pain, checks if there's severe abdominal distension. If yes, predicts surgery.
3. **Node 2:** If abdominal distension is not severe, checks if nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter. If yes, predicts surgery.
4. **Node 3:** If reflux is not severe, checks if rectal examination findings are absent. If yes, predicts surgery.
5. **Node 4:** If rectal examination findings are not absent, checks if the horse is experiencing moderate pain (depressed). If yes, predicts surgery.
6. **Final Else:** If none of the above conditions are met, predicts the lesion is non-surgical.

This function returns both the prediction (whether surgery is needed or not) and a list of boolean values representing whether each condition was satisfied or not.
