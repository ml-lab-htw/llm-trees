### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: `pain` is a critical indicator. Severe pain (either continuous or intermittent) strongly suggests a surgical lesion, so we split based on whether the pain level is in the severe categories (`2 = continuous severe pain`, `5 = intermittent severe pain`).
   
2. **Node 1**: If severe pain is absent, we check for **abdominal_distension**. Severe abdominal distension (coded as `3`) is a red flag for surgical conditions.

3. **Node 2**: If abdominal distension is moderate or less, we check **nasogastric_reflux**. Reflux greater than 1 liter (coded as `0 = more than 1 liter`) is an indicator of potential surgical intervention.

4. **Node 3**: If reflux is not significant, we check **rectal_examination**. A distended small intestine (coded as `2 = distended small intestine`) is a strong sign of a surgical condition.

5. **Node 4**: Finally, if the rectal examination doesn't suggest an issue, we check **abdominocentesis_appearance**. A serosanguinous appearance (coded as `3`) indicates bowel compromise and suggests surgery.

6. **Node 5**: If none of the above conditions are met, the decision is non-surgical (prediction `0`).
