Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree logic based on the provided feature keys and encoding. It also returns a list of truth values (`nodes`) representing whether the conditions for each inner node are satisfied (1 if true, 0 otherwise).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0) based on given feature values.
    
    Parameters:
    - X: A dictionary containing feature values. Keys must match the provided feature names.

    Returns:
    - prediction: 1 (surgical) or 0 (non-surgical)
    - nodes: A list of truth values (1 for satisfied, 0 otherwise) for each decision node.
    """
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["abdominocentesis_appearance"] == 3  # serosanguinous
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] == 2  # continuous severe pain
    nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # severe
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # more than 1 liter
    nodes[4] = X["rectal_temperature"] > 39.0  # High rectal temperature threshold
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Abdominocentesis Appearance is serosanguinous
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe pain
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Severe abdominal distension
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Nasogastric reflux > 1 liter
                    prediction = 1  # surgical
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:  # Rectal temperature > 39.0°C
                        prediction = 1  # surgical
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage

You can call this function with a dictionary of feature values to get the prediction and the list of truth values for the decision tree nodes. Here's an example:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
features = {
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2,  # cloudy
    "pain": 2,  # continuous severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 1,  # moderate
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # more than 1 liter
    "rectal_temperature": 39.5,  # High temperature
}

# Get prediction and truth values for nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(features)

# Outputs
print("Prediction (1 = surgical, 0 = non-surgical):", prediction)
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
Suppose the input feature dictionary (`features`) results in these conditions:
- **Node 0:** `abdominocentesis_appearance` is not serosanguinous → `nodes[0] = 0`
- **Node 1:** `pain` is continuous severe pain → `nodes[1] = 1`
- **Node 2:** `abdominal_distension` is not severe → `nodes[2] = 0`
- **Node 3:** `nasogastric_reflux` is more than 1 liter → `nodes[3] = 1`
- **Node 4:** `rectal_temperature` is greater than 39.0°C → `nodes[4] = 1`

Output:
```plaintext
Prediction (1 = surgical, 0 = non-surgical): 1
Nodes truth values: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
```

This setup ensures you can follow along with the conditions checked in the decision tree and the prediction it produces.
