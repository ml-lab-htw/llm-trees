Based on the Features and the target variable, I will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. The goal is to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery). Given that a decision tree with depth 1 can only have a single inner node, I will choose a feature that is likely to be important based on the provided feature descriptions.

One possible feature that might be highly indicative of whether surgery is needed is **"abdominal_distension"**. Distension of the abdomen is often a sign of a serious condition in horses that may require surgery.

Here is the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision based on abdominal distension
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # Severe or moderate distension may require surgery
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery is required
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery is required
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree checks if the **"abdominal_distension"** feature is 3 or greater (which corresponds to "severe" or "moderate" abdominal distension).
- If the condition is satisfied (`abdominal_distension >= 3`), the tree predicts that surgery is required (`prediction = 1`).
- If the condition is not satisfied (`abdominal_distension < 3`), the tree predicts that surgery is not required (`prediction = 0`).
  
This simple decision tree function returns the prediction and a list (`nodes`) that stores the truth value of the condition.
