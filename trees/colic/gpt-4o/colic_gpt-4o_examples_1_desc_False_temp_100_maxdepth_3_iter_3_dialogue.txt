Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree for your dataset, which makes a prediction (`0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery`) based on the features and also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # Check if degree of pain is greater than 'moderate' (e.g., 2 = "continuous severe pain")
    nodes[1] = X["abdomen"] != 4  # Check if abdomen appearance is not 'normal' (4 = normal)
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # Check if capillary refill time is greater than 3 seconds (0 = "more than 3 seconds")
    
    # Prediction logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # If pain <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # If abdomen is not normal
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # If abdomen is normal
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
    else:  # If pain > moderate
        if nodes[2]:  # If capillary refill time > 3 seconds
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # If capillary refill time <= 3 seconds
            prediction = 1  # Surgical (condition severe enough)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Tree Implementation:
1. **Nodes Representing Inner Conditions:**
    - **`nodes[0]`:** Checks if the degree of pain is greater than "moderate" (encoded as `2` in the dataset). This split captures severe cases likely requiring surgery.
    - **`nodes[1]`:** Checks if the abdomen appearance is abnormal. If the abdomen is normal (coded as `4`), it suggests the case is likely non-surgical.
    - **`nodes[2]`:** Checks if the capillary refill time is greater than 3 seconds (coded as `0`). This is an indicator of compromised circulation and severity.

2. **Tree Logic for Prediction:**
   - If **pain** is less than or equal to moderate (non-severe cases):
     - Check **abdomen appearance**. If abnormal, predict `surgery = 1`. If normal, predict `surgery = 0`.
   - If **pain** is greater than moderate (severe cases):
     - Check **capillary refill time**. If greater than 3 seconds, predict `surgery = 1`. Else, predict `surgery = 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - `prediction` is the final decision (`0` for "no surgery," `1` for "surgery").
   - `nodes` is a list of evaluations for the inner decision conditions (`1` for the condition satisfied, `0` otherwise).

### Example Input/Output:

#### Example 1:
Input:
```python
X = {
    "pain": 3,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 0
}
```

Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 1 (surgical case)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Nodes: [True, False, True]
```

Explanation: Pain is `3` (greater than moderate), capillary refill time is `0` (greater than 3 seconds), so the model predicts surgery.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```python
X = {
    "pain": 2,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1
}
```

Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 0 (not surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Nodes: [False, False, False]
```

Explanation: Pain is not greater than moderate, abdomen is normal, and capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds, so the prediction is "not surgical."
