### Explanation:
1. **Inner Node 1**: The first decision is based on the **Degree of Pain**. If the horse is experiencing "continuous severe pain" (which is encoded as `2`), the decision tree classifies the lesion as surgical (`prediction = 1`).
   
2. **Inner Node 2**: If the pain is not severe, the decision is based on **Abdominal Distension**. If the horse has "moderate" (`1`) or "severe" (`3`) abdominal distension, the lesion is classified as surgical (`prediction = 1`). Otherwise, the tree classifies it as non-surgical (`prediction = 0`).

3. The function returns both the **prediction** and the **truth values of the inner nodes** in the `nodes` list:
   - `nodes[0]` will be `True` if the pain is severe, and `False` otherwise.
   - `nodes[1]` will be `True` if abdominal distension is moderate or severe, and `False` otherwise.
