Sure! Below is a simple Python function that constructs a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. It uses the given features and the mapping you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Mapping the features based on description provided
    # pain: Degree of Pain (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    # abdominal_distension: Abdominal Distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
    
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # Degree of pain <= intermittent mild pain (4)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # Abdominal distension <= slight (4)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the degree of pain is less than or equal to `4` (intermittent mild pain).
- **Node 1** checks if the abdominal distension is less than or equal to `4` (slight).

- If the degree of pain is less than or equal to `4` and abdominal distension is less than or equal to `4`, the lesion is considered Not Surgical.
- Otherwise, the lesion is considered Surgical.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
# Example input dictionary
X_example = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 37.5,
    'pulse': 80,
    'respiratory_rate': 20,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 3,  # depressed
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 2,  # none
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 50,
    'total_protein': 6.0,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'outcome': 3
}

prediction, node_states = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Surgical' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Surgical'}")
print(f"Node states: {node_states}")
```

This will output:

```
Prediction: Not Surgical
Node states: [True, True]
```

You can adjust the threshold values based on the actual distribution of your data and the results of your feature importance analysis for better accuracy.
