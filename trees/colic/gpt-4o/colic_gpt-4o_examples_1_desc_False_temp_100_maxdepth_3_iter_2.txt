Here is the decision tree with a maximum depth of 3, based on the Features and target variable:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] != 2  # Check if there's any abdominal distension (2 means none)
    
    # Node 1: Pain Level
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] >= 4  # Severe or intermittent pain (4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    
    # Node 2: Capillary Refill Time
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # Capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds (indicating poor perfusion)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Predict surgery if abdominal distension and pain level are high
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Predict surgery if abdominal distension and poor perfusion
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery if distension and normal perfusion, and mild pain
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery if no abdominal distension
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first node checks if there is any abdominal distension (anything other than 2 = none). If there is distension, we move down the tree to assess further conditions.
- **Node 1**: If the abdominal distension exists, the second node checks if the pain level is severe (pain >= 4). If so, we predict surgery.
- **Node 2**: If the pain is not severe, we check the capillary refill time. A refill time of more than 3 seconds (indicating poor perfusion) leads to a prediction of surgery.
- If there is no abdominal distension, we predict no surgery.

This decision tree uses three key features to classify whether surgery is needed or not, and it adheres to the maximum depth of 3.
