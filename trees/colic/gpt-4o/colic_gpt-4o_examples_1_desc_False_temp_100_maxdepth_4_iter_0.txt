Here is a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 4 based on the Features you provided. The tree will predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check rectal_temperature
    nodes[0] = X["rectal_temperature"] <= 38.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check pain
        nodes[1] = X["pain"] >= 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check abdominal_distension
            nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 1  # moderate distension
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Check packed_cell_volume
                nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 50
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # surgery
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:
            # Node 2: Check peristalsis
            nodes[2] = X["peristalsis"] == 1  # absent peristalsis
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
    else:
        # Node 1: Check mucous_membranes
        nodes[1] = X["mucous_membranes"] == 3  # dark cyanotic membranes
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check nasogastric_reflux
            nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # more than 1 liter reflux
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Check peripheral_pulse
                nodes[3] = X["peripheral_pulse"] == 1  # absent pulse
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # surgery
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The decision tree first checks if the rectal temperature is less than or equal to 38.5°C. If the horse has a normal or low temperature, it proceeds to the next condition.
2. **Node 1**: If the temperature condition is met, it checks if the horse's pain level is 3 or higher (depressed or worse). If the pain level is high, the tree checks for abdominal distension.
3. **Node 2**: If moderate abdominal distension is present, it further checks the packed cell volume. High packed cell volume (>50) is a strong indicator of surgery.
4. **Node 3**: If packed cell volume is normal, surgery is less likely, otherwise, surgery is predicted.

If the rectal temperature is higher than 38.5°C:
- The model checks the appearance of the mucous membranes and nasogastric reflux, which are strong indicators of surgery if abnormal values are found, especially when combined with an absent peripheral pulse.

This decision tree function will return a prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list indicating the truth values of the inner nodes.
