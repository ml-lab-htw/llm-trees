Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The function predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the feature names exactly.
    
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 if the lesion is not surgical, 1 if it is surgical.
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 or 0) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain <= 3 (moderate or less)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # 1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
    
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension <= 4 (slight or none)
    if nodes[0]:  # If Degree of Pain is moderate or less
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
        if nodes[1]:  # If Abdominal Distension is slight or none
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
        else:  # If Abdominal Distension is moderate or severe
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:  # If Degree of Pain is severe
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the **Degree of Pain** is moderate or less (`pain <= 3`). This corresponds to the first split in the decision tree.
2. **Node 1**: If the first condition is satisfied, the second condition checks if the **Abdominal Distension** is slight or none (`abdominal_distension <= 4`).
3. **Predictions**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If the first condition is satisfied but the second is not, the lesion is classified as **surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
   - If the first condition is not satisfied (i.e., the pain is severe), the lesion is classified as **surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
4. **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list contains the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether the first condition (`pain <= 3`) is satisfied.
   - `nodes[1]`: Whether the second condition (`abdominal_distension <= 4`) is satisfied (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is True).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "pain": 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # Severe distension
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, False]
```

### Thresholds Used:
- **Degree of Pain (`pain`)**: Threshold of `3` (moderate or less) is used to determine if the pain is severe or not.
- **Abdominal Distension (`abdominal_distension`)**: Threshold of `4` (slight or none) is used to determine the severity of abdominal distension.

This function is consistent with the decision tree structure and provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
