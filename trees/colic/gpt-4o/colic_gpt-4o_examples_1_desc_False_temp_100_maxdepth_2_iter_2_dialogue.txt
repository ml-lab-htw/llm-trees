### Explanation:
- **Node 1** checks if the degree of pain (`pain`) is severe (either continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain, encoded as `2` and `5` respectively). If true, surgery (`1`) is predicted.
- **Node 2** checks if there is severe abdominal distension (`abdominal_distension` is `3`). If true, it predicts surgery. If not, it predicts no surgery (`0`).
- The function returns the predicted class (`0` for no surgery or `1` for surgery) as well as a list (`nodes`) representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false).
