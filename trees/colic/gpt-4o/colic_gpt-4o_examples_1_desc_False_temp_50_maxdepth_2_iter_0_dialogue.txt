Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree for determining whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. It uses the features `pain` and `abdominal_distension` as the most important features, and it follows the format and conventions provided in your example:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on given features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact spelling of the feature names.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 (not surgical) or 1 (surgical)
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values for the inner nodes.

    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' is <= 4 (intermittent mild pain or less severe).
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4

    # Node 1: If Node 0 is True, check if 'abdominal_distension' is <= 4 (slight or less severe).
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Node 0**: The root node checks whether the degree of pain (`pain`) is less than or equal to `4` (intermittent mild pain or less severe). If this condition is satisfied, the horse is less likely to require surgery, and we proceed to Node 1 for further evaluation.
2. **Node 1**: If the condition in Node 0 is satisfied, we check whether the abdominal distension (`abdominal_distension`) is less than or equal to `4` (slight or less severe). If this condition is also satisfied, the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (`0`). Otherwise, it is classified as **surgical** (`1`).
3. If the condition in Node 0 is not satisfied (i.e., `pain` is more severe than intermittent mild pain), the lesion is classified as **surgical** (`1`) without further checks.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X = {
    "pain": 5,  # Intermittent severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # Severe abdominal distension
}

# Predict using the decision tree
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, None]
```

### Notes:
1. The feature thresholds (`4` for `pain` and `4` for `abdominal_distension`) were chosen based on the feature descriptions and logical reasoning about their importance in determining a surgical case. These thresholds can be adjusted based on actual data or domain expertise.
2. The `nodes` list contains `1` if the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied and `0` otherwise. For nodes that are not evaluated (e.g., Node 1 when Node 0 is `False`), the value remains `None`.
3. Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required features with the exact keys and encodings as specified in your dataset. Missing or misspelled keys will result in an error.
