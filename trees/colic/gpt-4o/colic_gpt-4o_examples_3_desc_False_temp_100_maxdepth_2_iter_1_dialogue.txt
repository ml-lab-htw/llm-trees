Certainly! I'll implement a decision tree function to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not using the provided features and encoding. The decision tree will use the specified features from the problem description, and it will return a prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain severity check
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2 or X["pain"] == 5
    
    # Degree of Pain is severe
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Abdominal Distension severity check
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
        
        # Severe Abdominal Distension
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:
        # Degree of Pain is not severe
        # Node 2: Pulse check
        nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80
        
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 85,
    'respiratory_rate': 20,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 2,
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 3,
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 38,
    'total_protein': 7.0,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': None,
    'outcome': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f'Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}')
```

Explanation of the tree:
1. **Node 0:** Check if the Degree of Pain is severe (`pain == 2` or `pain == 5`).
2. **Node 1:** If the Degree of Pain is severe, check if the Abdominal Distension is severe (`abdominal_distension == 3`).
   - If severe, classify as surgical (`prediction = 1`).
   - If not severe, classify as non-surgical (`prediction = 0`).
3. **Node 2:** If the Degree of Pain is not severe, check if the Pulse is greater than 80 bpm.
   - If greater, classify as surgical (`prediction = 1`).
   - If not greater, classify as non-surgical (`prediction = 0`).

This function uses the most critical features and thresholds to make predictions based on the decision tree logic described. The inner nodes are represented by a boolean list, showing which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process.
