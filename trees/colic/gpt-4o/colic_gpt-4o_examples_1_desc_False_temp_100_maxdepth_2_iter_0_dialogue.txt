Hereâ€™s a Python function implementing a decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, based on the provided features and requirements.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain
    # If pain (X["pain"]) is less than or equal to 4 (intermittent mild pain), it's less likely surgical
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # 4: intermittent mild pain
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Abdominal Distension
        # If abdominal distension (X["abdominal_distension"]) is less than 3 (i.e., "none" or "slight"), classify as non-surgical
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] < 3  # 3: severe distension
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        # If pain is greater than 4 (e.g., severe pain), classify as surgical regardless of abdominal distension
        prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0 (Degree of Pain):** 
   - Maps to the feature `X["pain"]`.
   - Encodes the assumption that mild or no pain (values <= 4, "alert" or "intermittent mild pain") is associated with non-surgical conditions.
   - Severe pain (values > 4) leads to a higher likelihood of surgery.

2. **Node 1 (Abdominal Distension):**
   - Maps to the feature `X["abdominal_distension"]`.
   - Considers whether abdominal distension is less than 3, which corresponds to "none" or "slight." These are more likely non-surgical cases.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Combines the two conditions to determine the final decision:
     - If pain is mild or none (`pain <= 4`), check abdominal distension. If the distension is less than 3, classify as **non-surgical**; otherwise, classify as **surgical**.
     - If pain is severe (`pain > 4`), classify as **surgical.**

This function follows your required format and uses reasonable thresholds based on the feature descriptions provided. You can call the function with a dictionary of features for prediction. For example:

```python
example_input = {
    "pain": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    # Additional features can be included but are ignored by this tree
}
prediction, truth_values = predict(example_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (non-surgical)
print("Truth Values:", truth_values)  # Output: [True, True]
```
