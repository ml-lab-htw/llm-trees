def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Degree of Pain "severe" (encoded as 2 for "continuous severe pain" or 5 for "intermittent severe pain")
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        # Node 2: Abdominal Distension "severe" (encoded as 3 for "severe")
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 1** checks if the **pain** is either "continuous severe pain" (encoded as 2) or "intermittent severe pain" (encoded as 5). If this condition is true, the lesion is classified as **surgical** (1), and the function returns.
- If **Node 1** is false, we then check **Node 2**, which evaluates whether the **abdominal_distension** is "severe" (encoded as 3). If this condition is true, the lesion is classified as **surgical** (1).
- If both conditions are false, the lesion is classified as **non-surgical** (0).
  
The function also returns a list `nodes` that records whether each of the conditions in the inner nodes was satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false).
