Below is the Python function following your requirements for the given features related to horse colic lesion classification. The decision tree uses "Degree of Pain" (corresponding to `pain`) as the most important feature, as computed earlier, with a maximum depth of 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not using a decision tree 
    of depth 1 based on the 'pain' feature.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): Input features as a dictionary, with keys matching the feature names.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for inner nodes. 1 = condition satisfied, 0 = not satisfied.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Check the condition for the root (only) node
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] != 1  # condition: pain is anything except "none" (encoded as 1)
    
    # If the condition at the root node is satisfied, predict surgery (1); otherwise, no surgery (0)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:
        prediction = 0  # no surgery
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Feature Used**: The tree uses the `pain` feature, which corresponds to the `Degree of Pain` feature. It is represented as follows:
   - `1 = alert`.
   - `2 = continuous severe pain`.
   - `3 = depressed`.
   - `4 = intermittent mild pain`.
   - `5 = intermittent severe pain`.

2. **Threshold for Root Node**: If `pain` is equal to `1` (alert or "none"), the lesion is classified as **no surgery** (`0`); otherwise, it is classified as **surgery** (`1`).

3. **Truth Values for Node Conditions**: A list `nodes` is created, with each element representing whether the condition at the corresponding inner node is satisfied (`1` for true, `0` for false). In this case, there is only one node.

4. **Target Variable**: The target variable is surgical classification (`0 = no surgery`, `1 = surgery`).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example 1: Horse with no pain
features = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.2,
    "pulse": 60,
    "respiratory_rate": 30,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 1,  # none (alert)
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7.2,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 40,
    "total_protein": 7.0,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 2.0,
    "outcome": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (no surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [0]

# Example 2: Horse with severe pain
features = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 80,
    "respiratory_rate": 40,
    "temp_extremities": 2,
    "peripheral_pulse": 4,
    "mucous_membranes": 5,
    "capillary_refill_time": 0,
    "pain": 2,  # continuous severe pain
    "peristalsis": 1,
    "abdominal_distension": 1,
    "nasogastric_tube": 2,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 6.9,
    "rectal_examination": 3,
    "abdomen": 1,
    "packed_cell_volume": 55,
    "total_protein": 8.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 5.0,
    "outcome": 2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [1]
```

### Notes:
- The function expects the input `X` as a dictionary where the keys match the feature names exactly.
- The decision tree classifier is simple and interpretable, leveraging only the "pain" feature with a maximum depth of 1.
