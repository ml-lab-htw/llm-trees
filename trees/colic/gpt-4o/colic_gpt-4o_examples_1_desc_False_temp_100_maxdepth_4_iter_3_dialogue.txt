Here is the requested Python function implementing the described decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0).
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys in the dictionary must match the feature names exactly.
        
    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical.
        nodes (list): A list of truth values (0/1) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain > 4 (intermittent severe pain or continuous severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 4
    
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension > 3 (severe or moderate abdominal distension)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 3
    
    # Node 2: Packed Cell Volume > 45 (elevated PCV indicating dehydration or blood concentration)
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
    
    # Node 3: Respiratory Rate > 30 (elevated respiratory rate suggestive of distress)
    nodes[3] = X["respiratory_rate"] > 30

    # Implementing the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain > 4
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension > 3
            if nodes[2]:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 45
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension <= 3
            if nodes[2]:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 45
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # Degree of Pain <= 4
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension > 3
            if nodes[3]:  # Respiratory Rate > 30
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:  # Respiratory Rate <= 30
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension <= 3
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **`nodes[0]:`** Degree of Pain > 4 (values 4 or 5 indicate serious pain, closely linked with surgical issues).
- **`nodes[1]:`** Abdominal Distension > 3 (severe abdominal distension strongly suggests surgical pathology).
- **`nodes[2]:`** Packed Cell Volume (PCV) > 45% (high PCV may indicate dehydration due to surgical issues like strangulation or torsion).
- **`nodes[3]:`** Respiratory Rate > 30 (elevated respiratory rates are often seen in distressed horses, possibly due to surgical lesions).

### Example:
To test this function, you can call it with a dictionary of feature inputs:

```python
# Example Input
features = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 48,
    "respiratory_rate": 35,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 5,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 4,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": None,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 55,
    "total_protein": 8.1,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 3,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.5,
    "outcome": 3,
}

# Predicting
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected Output: 1 (Surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values for the nodes based on the input
```

In this example:
- **Degree of Pain (5):** Severe pain -> `nodes[0] = True`.
- **Abdominal Distension (4):** Severe distension -> `nodes[1] = True`.
- **Packed Cell Volume (55):** High PCV -> `nodes[2] = True`.
- **Respiratory Rate (35):** Elevated rate -> `nodes[3] = True`.

The prediction would indicate a **surgical lesion (1)**.
