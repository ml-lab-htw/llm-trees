Here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 based on the Features and target variable:

### Decision Tree

To create the decision tree, I will focus on the most relevant features for determining whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery. Based on the provided features, I will use "pain" (degree of pain) and "abdominal_distension" (abdominal distension) to build the decision tree, as these are likely to be critical indicators of a surgical condition.

### Decision tree logic:
- If the horse shows severe pain, it likely requires surgery.
- If there is severe abdominal distension, it is also a strong indicator of surgery being needed.
- Lesser degrees of pain and distension may indicate that surgery is not required.

Here's the Python function that implements this decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check the degree of pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 2  # Surgery is more likely if pain is severe or continuous
    
    # Node 1: Check the abdominal distension if pain is present
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # Surgery is more likely if abdominal distension is severe
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery required
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery required (due to severe pain)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery required
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on the **degree of pain**. If the pain is severe (i.e., `pain >= 2`), we move to node 1 to check the abdominal distension. Otherwise, we predict no surgery (`prediction = 0`).
   
2. **Node 1**: If the pain is severe, we then check the **abdominal distension**. If the abdominal distension is severe (`abdominal_distension >= 3`), we predict surgery (`prediction = 1`). If the distension is less than severe but the pain is still significant, we still predict surgery.

### Example usage:

```python
X = {
    "pain": 3,  # Depressed
    "abdominal_distension": 2  # None
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Surgery required)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, False]
```

### Output:
- **Prediction**: 1, indicating that surgery is required.
- **Nodes**: `[True, False]`, meaning the first node condition (pain) is satisfied, but the second node condition (abdominal distension) is not.

This decision tree is simple and adheres to the constraint of a maximum depth of 2, with two inner nodes.
