Here’s a Python function to represent a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 based on the Features and target variable you provided (whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery or not). This decision tree has 3 inner nodes and is designed to provide a prediction of whether surgery is needed (`target = 1`) or not (`target = 0`). The conditions in the decision tree are hypothetical and based on the most relevant features that might influence the outcome.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Node 1: Check if rectal temperature is less than 37.5°C
    nodes[0] = X["rectal_temperature"] < 37.5

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Check if abdominal distension is severe or moderate
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # 1 = moderate, 3 = severe
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: Check if capillary refill time is greater than 3 seconds
            nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # 0 = more than 3 seconds
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        # Node 2: Check if pulse is greater than 80 bpm
        nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 80
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: Check if pain is continuous severe (2) or intermittent severe pain (5)
            nodes[2] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 1 (`nodes[0]`):** The first decision checks if the rectal temperature is below 37.5°C. A low rectal temperature might indicate a more severe condition requiring surgery.
   
2. **Node 2 (`nodes[1]`):**
   - If the rectal temperature is low, the next decision checks if the horse's abdominal distension is moderate or severe (`abdominal_distension` in [1, 3]), which could be a sign of a more serious condition.
   - If the rectal temperature is not low, the next decision checks if the horse's pulse is elevated (greater than 80 bpm), which might indicate a more serious condition that could require surgery.

3. **Node 3 (`nodes[2]`):**
   - If the abdominal distension is severe/moderate, the next decision checks if the capillary refill time is greater than 3 seconds (`capillary_refill_time == 0`), indicating poor circulation, which could be associated with a need for surgery.
   - If the pulse is high, the next decision checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain (continuous or intermittent), which could indicate the need for surgery.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    "rectal_temperature": 37.2,
    "pulse": 90,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 0,
    "pain": 5,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 5.5,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 6.8,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.2,
    "outcome": 3
}

# Predict and print the result
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Surgery' if prediction == 1 else 'No Surgery'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the decision tree will traverse through the nodes based on the given conditions and return a prediction for whether surgery is required along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
