Below is a decision tree of depth 5 for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the provided features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if peristalsis is normal (4) or not
    nodes[0] = X["peristalsis"] == 4
    
    # Node 1: Check if mucous_membranes are normal pink (4)
    nodes[1] = X["mucous_membranes"] == 4
    
    # Node 2: Check if peripheral_pulse is normal (3)
    nodes[2] = X["peripheral_pulse"] == 3
    
    # Node 3: Check if nasogastric_reflux is less than 1 liter (1)
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 1
    
    # Node 4: Check if pain is intermittent severe pain (5)
    nodes[4] = X["pain"] == 5

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Surgery is needed
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # No surgery
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery is needed
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery is needed
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery is needed
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: First, we check if the `peristalsis` is normal (4). If yes, we proceed down the "No Surgery" path. If not, we lean towards surgery.
2. **Node 1**: Next, we check if the `mucous_membranes` are normal pink (4). If they are normal, it indicates a healthier condition and might not require surgery.
3. **Node 2**: We then check if the `peripheral_pulse` is normal (3). A normal pulse likely indicates no immediate need for surgery.
4. **Node 3**: We check if the `nasogastric_reflux` is less than 1 liter (1), which indicates a less severe condition.
5. **Node 4**: Finally, we assess if the horse is experiencing intermittent severe pain (5). If severe pain is present, surgery is more likely required.

### Usage:
You can call this function by passing a dictionary containing feature values, like so:

```python
X = {
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 1,
    "pain": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function will return the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
