To implement the decision tree described earlier in a Python function to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, let's use the specific feature keys and encodings provided. Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 5  # Degree of Pain equals Severe (Degree of Pain: 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # Abdominal Distension equals Severe (Abdominal Distension: 3 = severe)
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # Nasogastric Reflux more than 1 liter (Nasogastric Reflux: 0 = more than 1 liter)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Degree of Pain is severe
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # If Abdominal Distension is severe, it's surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # If Abdominal Distension is not severe, it's still surgical
    else:
        # If Degree of Pain is not severe
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # If Nasogastric Reflux is more than 1 liter, it's surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # If Nasogastric Reflux is not more than 1 liter, it's non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "surgery": 2,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.0,
    "pulse": 80,
    "respiratory_rate": 30,
    "temp_extremities": 4,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 5,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 3,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7.0,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 6.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 2,
    "outcome": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `predict(X: dict)` takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing the features of a horse.
2. The variable `nodes` is a list that keeps track of whether each inner node condition is satisfied (1) or not (0).
3. Each node condition checks specific feature values according to the decision tree:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the **Degree of Pain** is severe (encoded as 5 for intermittent severe pain).
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the **Abdominal Distension** is severe (encoded as 3 for severe).
   - `nodes[2]` checks if the **Nasogastric Reflux** is more than 1 liter (encoded as 0 for more than 1 liter).
4. The function uses nested if-else statements to determine the final prediction (`0` for non-surgical, `1` for surgical) based on the conditions described in the decision tree.
5. It returns the prediction and the list of nodes, which indicates which conditions were met.

You can adjust the example usage as needed to test different scenarios.
