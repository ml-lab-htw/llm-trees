Based on your requirements and the example formats provided, I will write a Python function that implements a decision tree classifier for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The function will also return a list of truth values for the decision nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 6  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the nodes

    nodes[0] = X['pain'] == 2  # Degree of Pain: continuous severe pain == 2
    nodes[1] = X['pain'] == 5  # Degree of Pain: intermittent severe pain == 5
    nodes[2] = X['Age'] == 0 and X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0  # Age: adult == 0, Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter == 0
    nodes[3] = X['Age'] == 0 and X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 1  # Age: adult == 0, Nasogastric Reflux < 1 liter == 1
    nodes[4] = X['abdominal_distension'] == 3  # Abdominal Distension: severe == 3
    nodes[5] = X['pulse'] > 60  # Pulse > 60 bpm

    if nodes[0]:  # If Degree of Pain is continuous severe pain
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    elif nodes[1]:  # If Degree of Pain is intermittent severe pain
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    elif X['pain'] == 3:  # If Degree of Pain is moderate
        if nodes[2]:  # Age is adult and Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        elif nodes[3]:  # Age is adult and Nasogastric Reflux < 1 liter
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        elif X['Age'] == 1:  # Age is young
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical (default case)
    elif X['pain'] == 4:  # If Degree of Pain is intermittent mild pain
        if nodes[4]:  # If Abdominal Distension is severe
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        elif X['abdominal_distension'] == 1:  # If Abdominal Distension is moderate
            if nodes[5]:  # If Pulse > 60 bpm
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:  # Pulse <= 60 bpm
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension is slight or none
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # If Degree of Pain is none or alert
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_features = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.3,
    'pulse': 70,
    'respiratory_rate': 20,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 2,
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 1,
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 45,
    'total_protein': 7.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 0.5,
    'outcome': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {'surgical' if prediction else 'non-surgical'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes Array**: The `nodes` array collects the truth values for the internal conditions in the decision tree.
2. **Conditions**: Each condition corresponds to a node in the decision tree.
    - Nodes `[0-5]` are based on the analysis from the initial decision tree structure.
3. **Nested If-Else Conditions**: These handle the logic for traversing the decision tree and determining the prediction.
4. **Return**: The function returns both the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and the list of boolean values for the nodes.

This implementation assumes the provided features include the correct keys and proper values. Adjust conditions as per your specific data and model if needed.
