Here is a decision tree of depth 5 based on the Features and target variable you provided. The target is whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (1) or not (0). I selected some of the more important features to build the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if the horse had surgery before
    nodes[0] = X["surgery"] == 2  # 2 = yes

    # Node 1: Check packed cell volume
    nodes[1] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45  # High PCV indicates dehydration, possibly requiring surgery

    # Node 2: Check if abdominal distension is severe
    nodes[2] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # 3 = severe

    # Node 3: Check total protein level
    nodes[3] = X["total_protein"] < 5.5  # Low protein can indicate severe conditions requiring surgery

    # Node 4: Check if peristalsis is absent
    nodes[4] = X["peristalsis"] == 1  # 1 = absent, a sign of severe intestinal issues

    # Now we create decision paths based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        # Surgery was already performed
        if nodes[1]:
            # High packed cell volume
            if nodes[2]:
                # Severe abdominal distension
                prediction = 1  # Surgery likely required
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Low total protein, surgery needed
            else:
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        # No surgery performed yet
        if nodes[4]:
            prediction = 1  # Absent peristalsis, surgery needed
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if surgery was already performed, as this is a very strong indicator of surgical intervention.
2. **Node 1**: Examines the packed cell volume, which can reflect dehydration, a serious condition that might require surgery.
3. **Node 2**: Looks at the severity of abdominal distension, as severe distension is often associated with surgical lesions.
4. **Node 3**: Investigates total protein, as low total protein can suggest the need for surgery.
5. **Node 4**: Checks if peristalsis is absent, a significant sign that surgery might be necessary.

### Usage:

```python
# Example usage
features = {
    "surgery": 1,  # no surgery
    "Age": 0,  # adult
    "rectal_temperature": 37.5,  # Normal
    "pulse": 80,  # Normal
    "respiratory_rate": 20,  # Normal
    "temp_extremities": 3,  # normal
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,  # normal
    "mucous_membranes": 4,  # normal pink
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,  # less than 3 seconds
    "pain": 1,  # alert
    "peristalsis": 4,  # normal
    "abdominal_distension": 2,  # none
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,  # none
    "nasogastric_reflux": 1,  # less than 1 liter
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 5.0,  # normal
    "rectal_examination": 4,  # normal
    "abdomen": 4,  # normal
    "packed_cell_volume": 50,  # high PCV
    "total_protein": 6.0,  # normal total protein
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,  # clear
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 2.5,  # normal
    "outcome": 3  # lived
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, the function will return a prediction of whether surgery is needed or not and the truth values for the conditions at each node of the decision tree.
