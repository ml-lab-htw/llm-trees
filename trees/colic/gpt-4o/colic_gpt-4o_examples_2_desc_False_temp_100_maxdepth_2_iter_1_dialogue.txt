Sure! Let's write a Python function for the decision tree classifier. This function will make predictions based on the given features and return both the prediction and the list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Evaluating the first level condition (Degree of Pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # intermittent mild pain or less
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Degree of Pain is moderate or less
        # Evaluating the second level condition (Packed Cell Volume)
        nodes[1] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45  # PCV threshold
        
        if nodes[1]:  # PCV is <= 45%
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:  # PCV is > 45%
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
    else:  # Degree of Pain is severe (higher than moderate)
        # Evaluating the second level condition (Abdominal Distension)
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # slight or none
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension is slight or less
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:  # Abdominal Distension is greater than slight
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Level Condition (Degree of Pain)**:
   - Check if `pain` is 4 (`intermittent mild pain`) or less.
   
2. **Second Level Condition**:
   - **If Degree of Pain is moderate or less**:
     - Check if `packed_cell_volume` is 45% or less.
       - If true, `prediction = 0` (No surgery).
       - Otherwise, `prediction = 1` (Surgery).
   - **If Degree of Pain is severe**:
     - Check if `abdominal_distension` is 4 (`slight`) or less.
       - If true, `prediction = 0` (No surgery).
       - Otherwise, `prediction = 1` (Surgery).

This simple decision tree is designed to classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the features provided. Adjustments may be made to the threshold values (such as packed cell volume) based on further domain knowledge or data analysis. This function returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes which can be useful for model interpretation and debugging.
