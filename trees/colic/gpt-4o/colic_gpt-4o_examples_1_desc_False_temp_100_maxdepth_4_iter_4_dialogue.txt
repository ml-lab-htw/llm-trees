Now, I will construct a Python function for the surgical/no-surgery horse colic prediction task based on the decision tree previously outlined. The function will return the predicted class and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Placeholder for the truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node evaluations based on the decision tree
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 1  # Pain: 1 = alert (none)
    
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension
    if not nodes[0]:  # Only evaluate Abdominal Distension if Pain is not None
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 2  # Abdominal Distension: 2 = none
    
    # Node 2: Packed Cell Volume
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1]:  # Only evaluate Packed Cell Volume if other features are relevant
        nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45.0  # Threshold to differentiate levels of severity (~normal range is 30â€“45%)
    
    # Node 3: Nasogastric Reflux
    if not nodes[0] and not nodes[1] and nodes[2]:  # Nasogastric Reflux is relevant only in certain severity cases
        nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # Nasogastric Reflux: 3 = none

    # Decision tree classification logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain == None
        prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension == None
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Packed Cell Volume <= 45.0
                if nodes[3]:  # Nasogastric Reflux == None
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery
            else:  # Packed Cell Volume > 45.0
                if X["mucous_membranes"] == 4:  # Mucous Membranes: 4 = normal pink
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Function:
1. **Input:**
   - `X`: A dictionary where each key is a feature (e.g., `"pain"`) and its corresponding value is the feature's value for the sample.
   - Example input:
     ```python
     X = {
         "pain": 2,                      # Severe continuous pain
         "abdominal_distension": 1,      # Moderate distension
         "packed_cell_volume": 50.0,     # Elevated packed cell volume
         "nasogastric_reflux": 0,        # Significant reflux (> 1 liter)
         "mucous_membranes": 6           # Pale pink mucous membranes
     }
     ```

2. **Nodes:**
   - The `nodes` list stores truth values (0 or 1) indicating whether specific conditions in the decision tree are satisfied. For example, `nodes[0] = 1` if `"pain" == 1` (no pain).

3. **Tree Logic:**
   - The tree hierarchy reflects the decision tree structure. For example:
     - If `"pain" == 1` (no pain), it directly predicts `0` (no surgery), and the rest of the nodes are not evaluated.
     - Otherwise, it evaluates `"abdominal_distension"`, `"packed_cell_volume"`, and `"nasogastric_reflux"` step by step.

4. **Output:**
   - `prediction`: 0 (no surgery) or 1 (surgery).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` if the condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise).

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "pain": 2,                      # Severe continuous pain
    "abdominal_distension": 1,      # Moderate distension
    "packed_cell_volume": 50.0,     # Elevated packed cell volume
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,        # Significant reflux (> 1 liter)
    "mucous_membranes": 6           # Pale pink mucous membranes
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Surgery)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [0, 0, 0, None]
``` 

This function models the decision tree with depth 4 while adhering strictly to the feature keys, target encoding, and constraints provided.
