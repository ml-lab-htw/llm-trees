Here's the implementation of the decision tree as a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (`1`) or not (`0`). It also returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes to show whether their conditions were satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not (1 = surgery, 0 = no surgery)
    based on the given features. Returns the prediction and a list of truth values
    for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features, where keys correspond to feature names and
        values correspond to feature values from the dataset.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where prediction is 0 or 1, and nodes is a list of truth values
        for the conditions in the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values for the inner nodes

    # Define the conditions for each inner node of the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] == 2 or X["pain"] == 5  # Severe pain (Degree of Pain == 2 or 5)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3   # Severe abdominal distension (Abdominal Distension == 3)
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0     # Significant nasogastric reflux (Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter)

    # Decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe abdominal distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Significant nasogastric reflux
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input `X`**: The function takes a dictionary `X`, where the keys are the exact feature names from the dataset, and the values are the corresponding feature values.
- **Nodes**: A list `nodes` is used to evaluate the truth values of the decision tree's inner conditions:
  - Node 0 checks if the degree of pain (`pain`) indicates severe pain (`2 = continuous severe pain`, `5 = intermittent severe pain`).
  - Node 1 checks if the abdominal distension (`abdominal_distension`) is classified as severe (`3 = severe`).
  - Node 2 checks if the amount of nasogastric reflux (`nasogastric_reflux`) is significant (`0 = more than 1 liter`).
- **Tree Evaluation**:
  - If Node 0 is `True`, the lesion is classified as **surgical** (`1`).
  - Otherwise, if Node 1 is `True`, it checks for severe abdominal distension and assigns a **surgical** classification.
  - If neither Node 0 nor Node 1 is `True`, it checks Node 2 for significant nasogastric reflux and classifies as **surgical** if it is present.
  - If none of the conditions are met, the lesion is classified as **non-surgical**.

### Example Usage
Here's how to use the `predict` function:

```python
X = {
    "pain": 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # Severe distension
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # More than 1 liter
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (1 = Surgical, 0 = Non-Surgical):", prediction)
print("Nodes (Truth values of conditions):", nodes)
```

### Expected Output
For the example input `X`:
```python
Prediction (1 = Surgical, 0 = Non-Surgical): 1
Nodes (Truth values of conditions): [True, True, True]
```

This output indicates that the lesion is classified as surgical because all conditions (severe pain, severe abdominal distension, and significant nasogastric reflux) are satisfied.

You can modify the input `X` to test different combinations of feature values!
