Sure, I will create a Python function that uses the provided features and the decision tree we previously constructed for classifying whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. Let's format the decision tree as a function that returns a single prediction and a list of nodes representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Surgery (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    nodes[0] = X['surgery'] == 2  # Surgery: yes

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Degree of Pain (2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
        nodes[1] = X['pain'] in [2, 5]  # Pain: moderate/severe (assuming moderate and severe are collectively treated as severe here)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage
X = {
    'surgery': 2,  # yes
    'pain': 5,     # intermittent severe pain
    # include other features as needed
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0:** Check if surgery is required (`X['surgery'] == 2`). If yes, proceed to the next node to evaluate the degree of pain. If no, classify as non-surgical.
2. **Node 1:** Check the degree of pain (`X['pain'] in [2, 5]`). If the pain level is severe (which can be continuous or intermittent), classify as surgical. If the pain is lower than severe, classify as non-surgical.

The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with the features and returns the prediction (whether a lesion is surgical or not) and a list `nodes` indicating which conditions were met.

### Example Usage:
The example demonstrates the function with a set of input features where `surgery` is required (2) and `pain` is intermittent severe (5), resulting in a prediction for surgery (1) and the corresponding conditions met in `nodes`.
