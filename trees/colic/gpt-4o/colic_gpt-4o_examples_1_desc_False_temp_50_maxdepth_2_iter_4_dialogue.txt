Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The function uses the features **pain** and **abdominal_distension**, as described earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the features provided.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values for a single instance.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] != 1  # Degree of Pain: 1 = alert (no pain)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] != 2  # Abdominal Distension: 2 = none

    if nodes[0]:  # If pain is not "none"
        if nodes[1]:  # If abdominal distension is not "none"
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Not surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inner Node 1 (`nodes[0]`)**:
   - Checks whether the **pain** feature is not equal to 1 (alert, no pain). If the horse is experiencing any pain (`pain != 1`), this node evaluates to `True`, otherwise `False`.

2. **Inner Node 2 (`nodes[1]`)**:
   - Checks whether the **abdominal_distension** feature is not equal to 2 (none). If there is any abdominal distension (`abdominal_distension != 2`), this node evaluates to `True`, otherwise `False`.

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If there is **no pain** (`nodes[0] == False`), the lesion is classified as **not surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If there is **pain** (`nodes[0] == True`), the decision depends on **abdominal distension**:
     - If there is **abdominal distension** (`nodes[1] == True`), the lesion is classified as **surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
     - Otherwise, it is classified as **not surgical** (`prediction = 0`).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    "abdominal_distension": 1,  # Moderate distension
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Another Example:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 1,  # Alert (no pain)
    "abdominal_distension": 2,  # None
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (not surgical)
print("Nodes:", [False, False])
```
