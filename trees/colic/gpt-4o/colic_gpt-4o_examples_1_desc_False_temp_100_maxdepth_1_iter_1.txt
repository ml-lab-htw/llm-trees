Based on the Features and target variable provided, we will create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1, selecting the most important feature for this task. Without actual training data, we will assume that the most important feature is `surgery` as it directly relates to whether surgery was performed or not, which seems crucial for predicting the target (`a horse colic lesion is surgical or not`).

Here is the decision tree classifier in Python format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["surgery"] == 2  # Surgery (1 = no, 2 = yes)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery (surgical lesion)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery (non-surgical lesion)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree has only 1 inner node (depth = 1).
- The condition checks if the value of `surgery` is `2` (meaning surgery was performed).
  - If this condition is `True` (i.e., surgery was performed), the decision tree predicts `1` (surgical lesion).
  - If the condition is `False` (i.e., no surgery was performed), the decision tree predicts `0` (non-surgical lesion).
- The function returns the prediction and a list with the truth value of the condition in the inner node (`nodes`).
