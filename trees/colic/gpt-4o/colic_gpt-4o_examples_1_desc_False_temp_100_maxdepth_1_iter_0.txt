Based on the Features and the target variable you provided (whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not), I will now build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. The goal is to create a simple decision tree using the most important feature from the provided list. Since I am not training the model on actual data, I will heuristically select a feature that seems most relevant to whether surgery is required or not.

After reviewing the features, I will use **nasogastric_reflux** as the most important feature for determining whether surgery is needed. This is because the volume of nasogastric reflux in horses is often associated with more severe gastrointestinal issues, which could necessitate surgical intervention.

Here is the decision tree in the requested format:

### Decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Evaluate the condition for the inner node
    nodes[0] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 1  # If nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter (0 = more than 1 liter, 1 = less than 1 liter)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery required
    else:
        prediction = 0  # No surgery required
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The inner node checks whether the **nasogastric reflux** is greater than 1 liter (i.e., `X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 1`).
- If the condition is satisfied (`nasogastric_reflux` is greater than 1 liter), the model predicts `1` (surgery required).
- If the condition is not satisfied (`nasogastric_reflux` is less than or equal to 1 liter), the model predicts `0` (no surgery required).
- The list `nodes` contains a single entry that indicates whether the condition of the inner node was satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "surgery": 1,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 37.5,
    "pulse": 72,
    "respiratory_rate": 16,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 4,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 2,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # Less than 1 liter
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7.5,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 6.8,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.2,
    "outcome": 3
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (No surgery required)
print("Inner nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Inner nodes: [0] (Condition not satisfied)
```
