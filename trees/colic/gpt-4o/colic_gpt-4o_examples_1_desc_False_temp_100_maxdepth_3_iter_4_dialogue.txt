Here is the Python implementation for the decision tree classifier, tailored to the colic dataset you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' (Degree of Pain) is less than or equal to moderate (4 = intermittent mild, 5 = intermittent severe)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # True if 'pain' is <= mild (non-severe), False otherwise

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if 'abdominal_distension' is less than or equal to slight (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # True if abdominal distension <= slight

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if 'pulse' is less than or equal to 80
            nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # True if pulse <= 80 bpm

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical

        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'nasogastric_reflux' is greater than none (3 = none, 0 = >1 liter, 1 = <1 liter, 2 = missing)
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] > 3  # True if nasogastric reflux is present (> none)

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

#### Nodes and Feature Checks:
1. **Node 0:** We check the degree of pain using the "pain" feature. Mild (values <= 4) pain usually indicates a less severe condition, so we first split based on this feature.
2. **Node 1 (Left):** If the degree of pain is mild or none, we check the level of abdominal distension using the "abdominal_distension" feature. Slight or non-existent distension (values <= 4) is less severe than moderate or severe distension.
3. **Node 2 (Left):** If the abdominal distension is slight or none, we take the pulse to make the final decision. A lower pulse (<= 80 bpm) is generally healthier and classified as non-surgical.
4. **Node 1 (Right, Severe Pain):** If the degree of pain is severe, we examine the presence of nasogastric reflux using the "nasogastric_reflux" feature. The presence of reflux (> none) suggests a surgical condition.

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s how you can use this function:

```python
# Example input:
features = {
    "surgery": 2,  # irrelevant for prediction
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 85,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 3,  # intermittent mild pain
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 4,  # slight
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # > 1 liter
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": None,
    "rectal_examination": 4,
    "abdomen": 1,
    "packed_cell_volume": 35,
    "total_protein": 6.8,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.5,
    "outcome": 3,
}

# Prediction:
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

#### Example Output:
If the function is called with the above features, the output might look like:
```
Prediction: 1
Node Truth Values: [True, True, False]
```

This means the `Degree of Pain` condition was satisfied, the `Abdominal Distension` condition was satisfied, but the `Pulse` condition was not satisfied. Ultimately, the decision was that surgery is required.
