Below is a decision tree classifier function based on the Features and the Target variable (whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not). The decision tree has a maximum depth of 3 and includes between 3 and 7 inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the abdominal distension is severe or not
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # 3 = severe
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If abdominal distension is severe, predict surgery
        prediction = 1  # Surgery (target = 1)
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # 0 = more than 1 liter
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter, predict surgery
            prediction = 1  # Surgery (target = 1)
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the packed cell volume is above 50%
            nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 50
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # If packed cell volume is above 50%, predict no surgery
                prediction = 0  # No surgery (target = 0)
            else:
                # If packed cell volume is not above 50%, predict surgery
                prediction = 1  # Surgery (target = 1)
                
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0:** The first decision is based on the severity of **abdominal distension**. If the abdominal distension is severe (`X["abdominal_distension"] == 3`), it leads to an immediate prediction of surgery (`prediction = 1`).
   
2. **Node 1:** If abdominal distension is not severe, the model then checks the **nasogastric reflux**. If the nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter (`X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0`), the prediction is surgery (`prediction = 1`).

3. **Node 2:** If nasogastric reflux is less than 1 liter or missing, the model then checks the **packed cell volume**. If the packed cell volume is above 50% (`X["packed_cell_volume"] > 50`), the prediction is no surgery (`prediction = 0`). Otherwise, the prediction is surgery (`prediction = 1`).

This decision tree is limited to a maximum depth of 3 and uses features that are likely relevant to the target variable (whether a lesion is surgical or not).
