Based on the Features and target variable, I will construct a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, as requested. The features used will be those that seem most relevant based on the description of the problem and the target variable (whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery or not).

For this example, I'll use the following features for the decision tree:
1. **pain**: Degree of pain, as severe pain can indicate a more serious condition that might require surgery.
2. **rectal_temperature**: Rectal temperature, as abnormal values could indicate a need for surgery.
3. **abdominal_distension**: Abdominal distension, as a distended abdomen is a common sign of colic that may require medical intervention, including surgery.

Here is the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: pain level
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 4  # severe or intermittent severe pain (values 4 or 5)
    
    # Second decision node: abdominal distension
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # moderate or severe distension (values 1 or 3)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If severe pain, check abdominal distension
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:
        # If pain is not severe, no surgery
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **First node (pain)**: If the horse is experiencing severe or intermittent severe pain (`pain >= 4`), this is a strong indication that surgery might be necessary. If this condition is satisfied, we move to the second node.
2. **Second node (abdominal distension)**: If there is moderate or severe abdominal distension (`abdominal_distension >= 3`), this further suggests a serious condition that may require surgery. If both conditions hold, the prediction is that surgery is needed (`prediction = 1`), otherwise, no surgery is needed (`prediction = 0`).
3. If the horse is not experiencing severe pain, the model predicts no surgery (`prediction = 0`).

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and makes use of relevant features to predict whether surgery is required based on the information provided.
