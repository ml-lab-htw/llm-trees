Below is the Python function corresponding to the requested implementation of the decision tree. It returns a single prediction (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery) along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes as placeholders
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree split conditions
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] != 1  # Degree of Pain != none (1 = alert)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] != 2  # Abdominal Distension != none (2 = none)
    nodes[2] = X["rectal_examination"] != 4  # Rectal Examination Findings != normal (4 = normal)
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] != 3  # Nasogastric Reflux != none (3 = none)
    nodes[4] = X["pulse"] > 80  # Pulse > 80 bpm

    # Decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # If pain != none
        if nodes[1]:  # If abdominal_distension != none
            if nodes[2]:  # If rectal_examination != normal
                if nodes[3]:  # If nasogastric_reflux != none
                    if nodes[4]:  # If pulse > 80
                        prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
                    else:  # If pulse <= 80
                        prediction = 0  # No surgery
                else:  # If nasogastric_reflux == none
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery
            else:  # If rectal_examination == normal
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:  # If abdominal_distension == none
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
    else:  # If pain == none
        prediction = 0  # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Implementation:
1. **Input Format**:
   The function takes an input dictionary `X` where keys correspond to the exact spelling of feature names, as defined in the prompt.

2. **Nodes**:
   The `nodes` list stores the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of conditions at each inner node along the decision tree.

3. **Conditions**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the degree of pain is different from "none" (encoded as 1).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if there is abdominal distension (any value except `none`, encoded as 2).
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if findings from the rectal examination are not normal (encoded as 4).
   - `nodes[3]`: Checks if there is nasogastric reflux (any value except `none`, encoded as 3).
   - `nodes[4]`: Checks if the pulse rate is greater than 80 beats per minute.

4. **Tree Depth**:
   The depth of the decision tree is capped at 5 by the problem statement.

5. **Prediction**:
   The prediction is determined by traversing the tree using nested `if` statements.

### Example Usage:

Consider the following feature input:

```python
X = {
    "surgery": 1,
    "Age": 0,
    "rectal_temperature": 38.0,
    "pulse": 85,
    "respiratory_rate": 20,
    "temp_extremities": 3,
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,
    "mucous_membranes": 4,
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,
    "pain": 3,
    "peristalsis": 4,
    "abdominal_distension": 1,
    "nasogastric_tube": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux": 1,
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7.0,
    "rectal_examination": 3,
    "abdomen": 4,
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 7.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 1,
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.0,
    "outcome": 3
}
```

Calling the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
```

Output:
```python
prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
nodes = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # All conditions satisfied
```
