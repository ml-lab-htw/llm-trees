Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses the features `pain` and `abdominal_distension` as the most important features for classification.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain <= 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension <= 4 (slight)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:  # Degree of Pain <= 4
        if nodes[1]:  # Abdominal Distension <= 4
            prediction = 0  # Not surgical
        else:  # Abdominal Distension > 4
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:  # Degree of Pain > 4
        prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the exact feature names (e.g., `"pain"`, `"abdominal_distension"`) and the values are the corresponding feature values.
2. **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the `pain` feature is less than or equal to 4 (intermittent mild pain).
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the `abdominal_distension` feature is less than or equal to 4 (slight).
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - If `pain` is less than or equal to 4, the decision depends on `abdominal_distension`.
   - If `pain` is greater than 4, the lesion is classified as surgical (1).
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "pain": 3,  # Depressed
    "abdominal_distension": 4,  # Slight
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Not surgical)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Thresholds Explanation:
- **`pain` <= 4**: This threshold is chosen because higher pain levels (e.g., 5 = intermittent severe pain, 2 = continuous severe pain) are more likely to indicate surgical cases.
- **`abdominal_distension` <= 4**: This threshold is chosen because slight or no abdominal distension is less likely to require surgery, while moderate or severe distension is more likely to indicate surgical cases.

This function adheres to the requirements and provides a clear, interpretable decision tree implementation.
