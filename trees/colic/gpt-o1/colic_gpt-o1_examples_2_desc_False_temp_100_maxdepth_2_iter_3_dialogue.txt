```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' is 'none' or 'mild' (pain levels 1 or 4)
    nodes[0] = int(X["pain"] in [1, 4])  # 1 = 'alert', 4 = 'intermittent mild pain'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Non-surgical (0 = no surgery)
        # Since node 1 is not evaluated when node 0 condition is satisfied, we set it to 0
        nodes[1] = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'abdominal_distension' is 'none' or 'slight' (distension levels 2 or 4)
        nodes[1] = int(X["abdominal_distension"] in [2, 4])  # 2 = 'none', 4 = 'slight'

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical (0 = no surgery)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical (1 = surgery)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** checks the **Degree of Pain**:
  - According to the feature encoding:
    - `pain` levels:
      - `1`: alert (considered as 'none')
      - `4`: intermittent mild pain (considered as 'mild')
    - Therefore, we check if `X["pain"]` is in `[1, 4]`.
  - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), the prediction is `0` (Non-surgical), and we do not need to evaluate Node 1.

- **Node 1** checks the **Abdominal Distension** only if Node 0's condition is not satisfied:
  - According to the feature encoding:
    - `abdominal_distension` levels:
      - `2`: none
      - `4`: slight
    - Therefore, we check if `X["abdominal_distension"]` is in `[2, 4]`.
  - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] = 1`), the prediction is `0` (Non-surgical).
  - If not, the prediction is `1` (Surgical).

- The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values for the conditions at each node:
  - `nodes[0]` is `1` if the Degree of Pain is 'none' or 'mild', else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]` is `1` if the Abdominal Distension is 'none' or 'slight', else `0`. If Node 0's condition is satisfied, `nodes[1]` is set to `0` (or could be set to `None` to indicate it wasn't evaluated).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input where pain is 'alert' (1) and abdominal_distension is 'severe' (3)
X_example = {
    'pain': 1,
    'abdominal_distension': 3,
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Surgical' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-surgical'}")
print(f"Node evaluations: {nodes}")
```

**Note:**

- This function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains the keys `'pain'` and `'abdominal_distension'` with encoded integer values as specified.
- Since the features are categorical, we check for specific category values rather than numerical thresholds.
- The rest of the features are not used in this decision tree of depth 2.

**Feature Encodings Recap:**

- `pain` (Degree of Pain):
  - `1`: alert
  - `2`: continuous severe pain
  - `3`: depressed
  - `4`: intermittent mild pain
  - `5`: intermittent severe pain

- `abdominal_distension` (Abdominal Distension):
  - `1`: moderate
  - `2`: none
  - `3`: severe
  - `4`: slight

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: Non-surgical (no surgery needed)
- `1`: Surgical (surgery needed)
