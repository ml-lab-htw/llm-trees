Based on the features and encodings provided, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function `predict` that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of this list will be `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

**Decision Tree Structure:**

We'll use the following features:

1. **pain** (Degree of Pain)
2. **pulse** (Pulse rate)
3. **abdominal_distension** (Abdominal Distension)

**Encoding of Features:**

- **pain:**
  - 1 = alert
  - 2 = continuous severe pain
  - 3 = depressed
  - 4 = intermittent mild pain
  - 5 = intermittent severe pain

- **pulse:**
  - Numeric value (beats per minute)

- **abdominal_distension:**
  - 1 = moderate
  - 2 = none
  - 3 = severe
  - 4 = slight

**Target Variable:**

- **surgical lesion:** (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery)

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None, None]

    # Node 0: Is the Degree of Pain severe?
    # Severe pain corresponds to 'continuous severe pain' (2) or 'intermittent severe pain' (5)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['pain'] in [2, 5] else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Prediction: Surgical lesion (1)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Is the Pulse rate less than or equal to 80 bpm?
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['pulse'] <= 80 else 0

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is the Abdominal Distension 'none' or 'slight'?
            # 'none' (2) or 'slight' (4)
            nodes[2] = 1 if X['abdominal_distension'] in [2, 4] else 0

            if nodes[2]:
                # Prediction: Non-surgical lesion (0)
                prediction = 0
            else:
                # Prediction: Surgical lesion (1)
                prediction = 1
        else:
            # Prediction: Surgical lesion (1)
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Node 0 (Depth 1):** Checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain.
   - **Condition:** `X['pain'] in [2, 5]` (severe pain)
     - `2` = continuous severe pain
     - `5` = intermittent severe pain
   - **nodes[0]:** `1` if severe pain, else `0`.
   - **Action:**
     - If **yes** (`nodes[0] == 1`), classify as **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
     - If **no** (`nodes[0] == 0`), proceed to Node 1.

2. **Node 1 (Depth 2):** Evaluates the horse's pulse rate.
   - **Condition:** `X['pulse'] <= 80`
     - A pulse rate less than or equal to 80 bpm is considered normal or slightly elevated.
   - **nodes[1]:** `1` if pulse is less than or equal to 80, else `0`.
   - **Action:**
     - If **yes** (`nodes[1] == 1`), proceed to Node 2.
     - If **no** (`nodes[1] == 0`), classify as **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).

3. **Node 2 (Depth 3):** Assesses the level of abdominal distension.
   - **Condition:** `X['abdominal_distension'] in [2, 4]` (none or slight)
     - `2` = none
     - `4` = slight
   - **nodes[2]:** `1` if abdominal distension is none or slight, else `0`.
   - **Action:**
     - If **yes** (`nodes[2] == 1`), classify as **Non-surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
     - If **no** (`nodes[2] == 0`), classify as **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following horse data:

```python
horse_data = {
    'pain': 3,                   # depressed
    'pulse': 70,                 # beats per minute
    'abdominal_distension': 1,   # moderate
}
```

Calling the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(horse_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Surgical)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: [0, 1, 0]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **Node 0:** `pain` is `3` (depressed), so `nodes[0] = 0`.
- **Node 1:** `pulse` is `70`, so `nodes[1] = 1`.
- **Node 2:** `abdominal_distension` is `1` (moderate), so `nodes[2] = 0`.
- **Prediction:** Surgical lesion (`1`), because although the pulse is normal, the abdominal distension is moderate, indicating potential need for surgery.

**Notes:**

- The function strictly adheres to the feature keys and encodings provided.
- The `nodes` list contains `1` or `0` indicating whether each condition is satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`).
- The depth of the tree is **3**, with three inner nodes corresponding to the conditions checked.
- The prediction is based on the pathway through the tree determined by the input features.

**Interpretation of Nodes:**

- **nodes[0]:** Severity of pain (`1` if severe, else `0`).
- **nodes[1]:** Pulse rate (`1` if â‰¤ 80 bpm, else `0`).
- **nodes[2]:** Abdominal distension (`1` if none or slight, else `0`).

- This decision tree is a simplified model for educational purposes.
- In clinical practice, decisions should be based on comprehensive veterinary evaluation and diagnostics.
