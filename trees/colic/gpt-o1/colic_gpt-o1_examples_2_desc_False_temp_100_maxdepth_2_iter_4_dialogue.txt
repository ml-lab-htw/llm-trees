**Explanation:**

This function implements the decision tree for predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical (requires surgery) or not, based on the two most important features: **pain** and **abdominal_distension**.

- **Inputs:**
  - `X`: A dictionary containing the features of a horse. The keys must match the exact feature names provided.

- **Outputs:**
  - `prediction`: An integer indicating the predicted class (0 for no surgery required, 1 for surgery required).
  - `nodes`: A list containing the boolean values of the inner nodes (decision conditions).

**Decision Logic:**

1. **Node 0:** Check the **Degree of Pain**.
   - `X["pain"] in [2, 5]` evaluates to `True` if the horse is experiencing severe pain.
     - `2`: Continuous severe pain
     - `5`: Intermittent severe pain
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, the horse requires surgery (`prediction = 1`).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, `nodes[1]` is set to `None` because it is not evaluated.

2. **Node 1:** If the pain is not severe (`nodes[0]` is `False`), check the **Abdominal Distension**.
   - `X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]` evaluates to `True` if the abdominal distension is moderate or severe.
     - `1`: Moderate distension
     - `3`: Severe distension
   - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, the horse requires surgery (`prediction = 1`).
   - If `nodes[1]` is `False`, the horse does not require surgery (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 85,
    'respiratory_rate': 20,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 5,  # Intermittent severe pain
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 2,
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 7.0,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 45,
    'total_protein': 7.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'outcome': 3
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Surgery Required' if prediction == 1 else 'No Surgery Required'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgery Required
Nodes: [True, None]
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with properly encoded values as specified.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were met (`True`) or not met (`False`) during the prediction process.
- If a node was not evaluated (because a previous condition was met), its value in the `nodes` list will be `None`.

**Interpretation of Nodes:**

- `nodes[0]`: Indicates whether the horse is experiencing severe pain.
  - `True`: Severe pain detected.
  - `False`: Severe pain not detected.
- `nodes[1]`: Evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `False`. Indicates whether the abdominal distension is moderate or severe.
  - `True`: Moderate or severe abdominal distension detected.
  - `False`: Abdominal distension is none or slight.
  - `None`: Node not evaluated because `nodes[0]` was `True`.

**Conclusion:**

This function captures the decision-making process of the provided decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. By focusing on the **pain** and **abdominal_distension** features, it allows for a straightforward and interpretable prediction of whether a horse requires surgery due to colic, based on the most critical clinical signs.
