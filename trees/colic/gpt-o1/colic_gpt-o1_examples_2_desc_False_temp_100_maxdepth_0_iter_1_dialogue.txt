Sure, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Degree of Pain is 'severe' or 'extreme'
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Abdominal Distension is 'severe' or 'moderate'
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80  # Pulse is greater than 80 beats per minute
    nodes[3] = X["peristalsis"] in [1, 3]  # Peristalsis is 'absent' or 'hypomotile'

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery required
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery required
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery required
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery required
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # No surgery required
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0**: Checks if the **Degree of Pain** (`pain`) is 'severe' or 'extreme'. In the dataset, these correspond to codes `2` (continuous severe pain) and `5` (intermittent severe pain).
  
- **Node 1**: Checks if the **Abdominal Distension** (`abdominal_distension`) is 'severe' or 'moderate'. These correspond to codes `3` (severe) and `1` (moderate).
  
- **Node 2**: Checks if the **Pulse** (`pulse`) is greater than `80` beats per minute.
  
- **Node 3**: Checks if the **Peristalsis** (`peristalsis`) is 'absent' or 'hypomotile', corresponding to codes `1` (absent) and `3` (hypomotile).

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- **pain (Degree of Pain)**:
  - `1` = alert
  - `2` = continuous severe pain
  - `3` = depressed
  - `4` = intermittent mild pain
  - `5` = intermittent severe pain

- **abdominal_distension (Abdominal Distension)**:
  - `1` = moderate
  - `2` = none
  - `3` = severe
  - `4` = slight

- **peristalsis (Peristalsis)**:
  - `1` = absent
  - `2` = hypermotile
  - `3` = hypomotile
  - `4` = normal

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where surgery is required
X = {
    'pain': 2,  # continuous severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 2,  # none
    'pulse': 85,  # beats per minute
    'peristalsis': 4  # normal
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Surgery Required" if prediction == 1 else "No Surgery")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgery Required
Nodes Truth Values: [True, False, True, False]
```

**Explanation of the Decision Path:**

- **Node 0**: `pain` is `2` (`True`) â‡’ Degree of Pain is severe.
  - The decision tree predicts **Surgery Required** without further checks because severe pain is a strong indicator.

**Note:** This function strictly follows the decision tree you provided, evaluating the most critical features to determine if surgery is required due to a horse colic lesion. It returns both the prediction (`0` for no surgery, `1` for surgery) and the list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions at each node.
