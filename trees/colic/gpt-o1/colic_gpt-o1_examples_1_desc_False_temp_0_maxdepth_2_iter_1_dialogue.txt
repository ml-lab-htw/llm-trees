```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] >= 3  # Moderate to severe pain (using pain scale mapping)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60 # Elevated pulse rate

    if nodes[0]:  # Moderate/Severe Pain
        if nodes[1]: # High Pulse
            prediction = 1 # Surgery
        else:       # Normal/Low Pulse
            prediction = 1 # Still likely surgery, but requires more investigation in reality
    else:          # Mild/No Pain
        prediction = 0 # No surgery

    return prediction, nodes


```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Pain Mapping:**  The provided pain feature uses a different scale (1-5) than the original description (none, mild, moderate, severe).  I've mapped values 3, 4, and 5 to moderate/severe pain, as they represent "depressed," "intermittent mild pain," and "intermittent severe pain," respectively. Even "depressed" can be associated with significant underlying issues requiring surgery. While "intermittent mild pain" might seem like a less severe category, it can still be indicative of a serious problem depending on the context.  This mapping requires careful consideration and potentially refinement with real veterinary expertise and data analysis.
* **Pulse Threshold:** The 60 bpm pulse threshold is a reasonable starting point based on general veterinary knowledge, but optimal thresholds should be determined with data analysis.
* **Simplified Model:**  This model is still extremely simplified. A real-world surgical decision would involve many more factors and expert judgment.
* **Missing Values:** The function doesn't handle missing values.  In a real application, you'd need to implement appropriate strategies for dealing with missing data (imputation, removing rows, etc.).



This improved function provides the prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes as requested.  However, it's essential to remember the limitations of such a simplified model and the importance of comprehensive veterinary assessment in real-world colic cases.
