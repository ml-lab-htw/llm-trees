Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function, following your specified format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4
    
    # Node 0: Check if Pulse is greater than or equal to 80 bpm
    nodes[0] = X['pulse'] >= 80
    
    # Node 1: Check if Degree of Pain indicates severe pain (2 or 5)
    nodes[1] = X['pain'] in [2, 5]
    
    # Node 2: Check if Abdominal Distension is moderate (1) or severe (3)
    nodes[2] = X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]
    
    # Node 3: Check if Rectal Temperature is greater than or equal to 38.5°C
    nodes[3] = X['rectal_temperature'] >= 38.5

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Pulse >= 80 bpm, classify as Surgical Lesion (Yes)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Degree of Pain is Severe, classify as Surgical Lesion (Yes)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Abdominal Distension is Moderate or Severe, classify as Surgical Lesion (Yes)
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    # If Rectal Temperature >= 38.5°C, classify as Surgical Lesion (Yes)
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    # Otherwise, classify as Surgical Lesion (No)
                    prediction = 0

    # Convert True/False to 1/0 for the nodes list
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the **pulse** rate is greater than or equal to 80 beats per minute (`X['pulse'] >= 80`).
- **Node 1:** Checks if the **Degree of Pain** indicates severe pain. In the encoding provided, severe pain corresponds to values **2** (`continuous severe pain`) and **5** (`intermittent severe pain`), so the condition is `X['pain'] in [2, 5]`.
- **Node 2:** Checks if the **Abdominal Distension** is moderate or severe. Moderate is encoded as **1** and severe as **3**, so the condition is `X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]`.
- **Node 3:** Checks if the **rectal_temperature** is greater than or equal to **38.5°C**, which can indicate fever or inflammation.

**Decision Path:**

- **If Node 0 is True** (`Pulse >= 80 bpm`):
  - **Prediction:** Surgical Lesion (**1**)
- **Else**, if Node 1 is True (`Degree of Pain` is severe):
  - **Prediction:** Surgical Lesion (**1**)
- **Else**, if Node 2 is True (`Abdominal Distension` is moderate or severe):
  - **Prediction:** Surgical Lesion (**1**)
- **Else**, if Node 3 is True (`rectal_temperature >= 38.5°C`):
  - **Prediction:** Surgical Lesion (**1**)
- **Else**:
  - **Prediction:** Non-Surgical Lesion (**0**)

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.7,
    'pulse': 75,
    'respiratory_rate': 16,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 4,
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 2,
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 7.0,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 42,
    'total_protein': 6.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'outcome': 3
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {'Surgical Lesion (Yes)' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Surgical Lesion (No)'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgical Lesion (Yes)
Nodes: [0, 0, 0, 1]
```

**Notes:**

- The function returns a **prediction** (0 or 1) and a list of **nodes** representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Each node is **1** if the condition is satisfied and **0** otherwise.
- The nodes correspond to the conditions in the decision tree in the following order:
  - **nodes[0]:** `pulse >= 80`
  - **nodes[1]:** `pain in [2, 5]`
  - **nodes[2]:** `abdominal_distension in [1, 3]`
  - **nodes[3]:** `rectal_temperature >= 38.5`
- **Feature Encodings:**
  - **'pain' Feature:**
    - 1: alert
    - 2: continuous severe pain (severe)
    - 3: depressed
    - 4: intermittent mild pain
    - 5: intermittent severe pain (severe)
  - **'abdominal_distension' Feature:**
    - 1: moderate
    - 2: none
    - 3: severe
    - 4: slight

**Thresholds and Conditions:**

- **Pulse Threshold (80 bpm):** Horses with a pulse rate of 80 or higher are likely experiencing significant distress, indicating a surgical lesion.
- **Rectal Temperature Threshold (38.5°C):** A rectal temperature of 38.5°C or higher suggests fever or inflammation, which may require surgical intervention.
- These thresholds were chosen based on veterinary medical standards and common indicators of severe colic in horses.

**Important Reminders:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys as specified.
- Pay attention to the feature encodings when preparing the input data.
- The output prediction corresponds to the target variable encoding: **0** for non-surgical lesion and **1** for surgical lesion.
