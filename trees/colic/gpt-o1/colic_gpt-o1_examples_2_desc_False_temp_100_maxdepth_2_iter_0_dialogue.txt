```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0, 0]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Degree of Pain is 'severe'
    # Encoded as 2 (continuous severe pain) or 5 (intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["pain"] in [2, 5] else 0
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Degree of Pain is severe, predict Surgical Lesion (Yes)
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Abdominal Distension is 'severe'
        # Encoded as 3
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["abdominal_distension"] == 3 else 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Abdominal Distension is severe, predict Surgical Lesion (Yes)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, predict Surgical Lesion (No)
            prediction = 0
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation**:

- **Node 0** checks if the **Degree of Pain** is severe:
  - Severe pain is encoded as `2` (continuous severe pain) or `5` (intermittent severe pain).
  - If this condition is satisfied, `nodes[0]` is set to `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.
- If **Node 0** condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] == 1`), the horse likely has a surgical lesion, so `prediction = 1`.
- If **Node 0** condition is not satisfied, proceed to **Node 1**.
- **Node 1** checks if the **Abdominal Distension** is severe:
  - Severe abdominal distension is encoded as `3`.
  - If this condition is satisfied, `nodes[1]` is set to `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.
- If **Node 1** condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] == 1`), predict a surgical lesion (`prediction = 1`); otherwise, predict no surgical lesion (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example**:

Suppose we have a horse with the following features:

```python
X = {
    'pain': 2,                  # continuous severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 1,  # moderate
    # Other features can be included as needed
}
```

We can make a prediction:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Surgical Lesion (Yes)' if prediction == 1 else 'Surgical Lesion (No)'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output**:

```
Prediction: Surgical Lesion (Yes)
Node Truth Values: [1, 0]
```

This indicates that the horse is predicted to have a surgical lesion, and the first node's condition was satisfied while the second was not.

**Note**: Make sure to provide all necessary feature values in the input dictionary `X` using the exact keys and encoded values as specified.
