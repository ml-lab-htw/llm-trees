Sure! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. It returns a single prediction (`0` for Non-Surgical, `1` for Surgical) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

I've ensured to use the exact feature names and encodings provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list of 4 elements for the nodes
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain
    # 'none or mild' pain corresponds to 'alert' (1) and 'intermittent mild pain' (4)
    nodes[0] = int(X['pain'] in [1, 4])
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Degree of Pain is 'none or mild', classify as Non-Surgical
        prediction = 0  # 0 = Non-Surgical (No Surgery)
        nodes[1] = nodes[2] = nodes[3] = None  # Remaining nodes are not evaluated
    else:
        # Degree of Pain is 'moderate or severe' (values 2, 3, 5)
        # Node 1: Pulse <= 80
        nodes[1] = int(X['pulse'] <= 80)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Pulse is less than or equal to 80 bpm, classify as Non-Surgical
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
            nodes[2] = nodes[3] = None
        else:
            # Pulse is greater than 80 bpm
            # Node 2: Abdominal Distension is 'none or slight'
            # 'none or slight' corresponds to values 2 and 4
            nodes[2] = int(X['abdominal_distension'] in [2, 4])
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Abdominal Distension is 'none or slight'
                # Node 3: Age == 'young' (1)
                nodes[3] = int(X['Age'] == 1)
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    # Age is 'young', classify as Surgical
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical
                else:
                    # Age is 'adult', classify as Non-Surgical
                    prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
            else:
                # Abdominal Distension is 'moderate or severe' (values 1, 3)
                # Classify as Surgical
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
                nodes[3] = None
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0: Degree of Pain (`pain`)**
  - **Values for 'none or mild' pain:**
    - `1` (alert)
    - `4` (intermittent mild pain)
  - We check if `X['pain']` is in `[1, 4]`.
  - If **True** (`nodes[0] = 1`), prediction is **Non-Surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If **False** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceed to Node 1.

- **Node 1: Pulse (`pulse`)**
  - We check if `X['pulse'] <= 80`.
  - If **True** (`nodes[1] = 1`), prediction is **Non-Surgical**.
  - If **False** (`nodes[1] = 0`), proceed to Node 2.

- **Node 2: Abdominal Distension (`abdominal_distension`)**
  - **Values for 'none or slight' distension:**
    - `2` (none)
    - `4` (slight)
  - We check if `X['abdominal_distension']` is in `[2, 4]`.
  - If **True** (`nodes[2] = 1`), proceed to Node 3.
  - If **False** (`nodes[2] = 0`), prediction is **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Node 3: Age (`Age`)**
  - **Value for 'young' age:**
    - `1` (young)
  - We check if `X['Age'] == 1`.
  - If **True** (`nodes[3] = 1`), prediction is **Surgical**.
  - If **False** (`nodes[3] = 0`), prediction is **Non-Surgical**.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where the horse has severe pain, high pulse, slight distension, and is young
X = {
    'pain': 2,                       # continuous severe pain
    'pulse': 85,                     # beats per minute
    'abdominal_distension': 4,       # slight
    'Age': 1,                        # young
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Surgical" if prediction == 1 else "Non-Surgical")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgical
Nodes: [0, 0, 1, 1]
```

- `nodes[0] = 0` (Degree of Pain is not 'none or mild')
- `nodes[1] = 0` (Pulse is not <= 80)
- `nodes[2] = 1` (Abdominal Distension is 'none or slight')
- `nodes[3] = 1` (Age is 'young')

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the decision tree with a maximum depth of 4.
- All feature names and encodings are used exactly as provided.
- The `nodes` list represents the truth values (`1` for True, `0` for False) of the conditions at each node in the tree.
- Unused nodes in certain paths are set to `None` for clarity.
- The target variable is encoded as `0` for Non-Surgical and `1` for Surgical, as specified.

**Decision Rules Recap:**

1. **Degree of Pain** (`pain`):
   - If **'alert' (1)** or **'intermittent mild pain' (4)** ⇒ **Non-Surgical**
   - Else, proceed to the next node.

2. **Pulse** (`pulse`):
   - If **`pulse` ≤ 80 bpm** ⇒ **Non-Surgical**
   - Else, proceed to the next node.

3. **Abdominal Distension** (`abdominal_distension`):
   - If **'none' (2)** or **'slight' (4)** ⇒ Proceed to the next node.
   - Else (values **'moderate' (1)** or **'severe' (3)**) ⇒ **Surgical**

4. **Age** (`Age`):
   - If **'young' (1)** ⇒ **Surgical**
   - If **'adult' (0)** ⇒ **Non-Surgical**

This function can now be used to predict whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not, based on the given features and the specified decision tree.
