Certainly! Based on your instructions, I've formatted the decision tree as a Python function named `predict`. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features as keys and their corresponding values. It returns a single prediction (0 for **Non-Surgical**, 1 for **Surgical**) and a list of truth values (`nodes`) representing whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the nodes
    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' is in [1, 3, 4]
    nodes[0] = int(X['pain'] in [1, 3, 4])  # 'alert', 'depressed', 'intermittent mild pain'

    if nodes[0]:  # If Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'abdominal_distension' is 3 ('severe')
        nodes[1] = int(X['abdominal_distension'] == 3)
        if nodes[1]:  # If Node 1 condition is satisfied
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

#### Feature Encodings:

- **pain** (Degree of Pain):
  - 1 = **alert**
  - 2 = **continuous severe pain**
  - 3 = **depressed**
  - 4 = **intermittent mild pain**
  - 5 = **intermittent severe pain**

- **abdominal_distension**:
  - 1 = **moderate**
  - 2 = **none**
  - 3 = **severe**
  - 4 = **slight**

#### Decision Tree Logic:

1. **Node 0**: Check the **Degree of Pain**.
   - Condition: Is `pain` in `[1, 3, 4]`?
     - Values `[1, 3, 4]` correspond to:
       - **1**: alert
       - **3**: depressed
       - **4**: intermittent mild pain
     - These represent **'none' or 'mild' pain**.
   - If **Node 0** condition is **True** (`nodes[0] = 1`):
     - **Prediction**: `0` (**Non-Surgical** lesion).
   - Else:
     - Proceed to **Node 1**.

2. **Node 1**: Check the **Abdominal Distension**.
   - Condition: Is `abdominal_distension` equal to `3`?
     - Value `3` corresponds to:
       - **3**: severe
     - This represents **'severe' abdominal distension**.
   - If **Node 1** condition is **True** (`nodes[1] = 1`):
     - **Prediction**: `1` (**Surgical** lesion).
   - Else:
     - **Prediction**: `0` (**Non-Surgical** lesion).

### Usage Example:

Suppose we have a horse with the following features:

```python
X = {
    'pain': 2,  # continuous severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 3,  # severe
    # Other features are not used in this tree
}
```

Call the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Surgical)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

---

### Interpretation of `nodes` List:

- `nodes[0] = 0`: The condition in Node 0 (**Degree of Pain is 'none' or 'mild'**) is **not satisfied**.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The condition in Node 1 (**Abdominal Distension is 'severe'**) is **satisfied**.

### Note on Thresholds and Conditions:

- The thresholds and conditions are based on meaningful clinical indicators and the feature encodings you've provided.
- The decision tree uses the most significant features influencing whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery.

### Complete Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize nodes list
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain is 'none' or 'mild'
    nodes[0] = int(X['pain'] in [1, 3, 4])  # 'alert', 'depressed', 'intermittent mild pain'

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    else:
        # Proceed to Node 1
        # Node 1: Abdominal Distension is 'severe'
        nodes[1] = int(X['abdominal_distension'] == 3)  # 'severe'
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Node 1 condition is satisfied
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    return prediction, nodes
```
