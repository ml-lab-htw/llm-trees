Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the specific feature encodings you've provided, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*5  # Initialize a list for node conditions

    # Node conditions based on the decision tree
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain is 'severe' (codes 2 or 5)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["pain"] in [2, 5] else 0

    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension is 'severe' (code 3)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["abdominal_distension"] == 3 else 0

    # Node 2: Pulse greater than 80 beats per minute
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["pulse"] > 80 else 0

    # Node 3: Nasogastric Reflux is '>1 liter' (code 0)
    nodes[3] = 1 if X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0 else 0

    # Node 4: Peristalsis is 'absent' (code 1)
    nodes[4] = 1 if X["peristalsis"] == 1 else 0

    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery is needed
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Surgery is not needed

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List**: Each element in the `nodes` list corresponds to a condition in the decision tree.
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the horse is experiencing **severe pain** (`pain` code 2 or 5).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if there's **severe abdominal distension** (`abdominal_distension` code 3).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the **pulse** is greater than **80 bpm**.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if **nasogastric reflux** is **'>1 liter'** (`nasogastric_reflux` code 0).
  - `nodes[4]`: Checks if **peristalsis** is **'absent'** (`peristalsis` code 1).

- **Prediction**:
  - If any of the critical conditions are met (i.e., the corresponding node is `1`), the function predicts that surgery is needed (`prediction = 1`).
  - If none of the conditions are met, it predicts that surgery is not needed (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'pain': 2,  # continuous severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 2,  # none
    'pulse': 85,  # elevated pulse
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,  # none
    'peristalsis': 4,  # normal
    # Other features can be included as needed
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Surgery needed" if prediction == 1 else "No surgery needed")
print("Node evaluations:", nodes)
```

**Note**: Remember to provide all required features in the input dictionary `X` when using the function.

**Feature Encodings Reminder:**

- `pain`:
  - 1 = alert
  - 2 = continuous severe pain
  - 3 = depressed
  - 4 = intermittent mild pain
  - 5 = intermittent severe pain
- `abdominal_distension`:
  - 1 = moderate
  - 2 = none
  - 3 = severe
  - 4 = slight
- `pulse`: Beats per minute (numeric value)
- `nasogastric_reflux`:
  - 0 = more than 1 liter
  - 1 = less than 1 liter
  - 2 = missing
  - 3 = none
- `peristalsis`:
  - 1 = absent
  - 2 = hypermotile
  - 3 = hypomotile
  - 4 = normal

**Decision Tree Conditions Recap:**

1. **Severe Pain** (`pain` is 2 or 5):
   - If yes, predict **surgery needed**.

2. **Severe Abdominal Distension** (`abdominal_distension` is 3):
   - If yes, predict **surgery needed**.

3. **Elevated Pulse** (`pulse` > 80 bpm):
   - If yes, predict **surgery needed**.

4. **Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter** (`nasogastric_reflux` is 0):
   - If yes, predict **surgery needed**.

5. **Absent Peristalsis** (`peristalsis` is 1):
   - If yes, predict **surgery needed**.

6. **Default**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, predict **no surgery needed**.
