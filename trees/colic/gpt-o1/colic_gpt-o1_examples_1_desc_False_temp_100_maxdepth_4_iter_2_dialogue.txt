Sure! Based on the decision tree provided and the exact feature encodings, here is a Python function `predict` that returns a single prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 4  # Initialize a list of 4 elements for the nodes
    
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain is severe
    # Severe pain corresponds to codes 2 (continuous severe pain) and 5 (intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = int(X["pain"] in [2, 5])
    
    # Node 1: Abdominal Distension is moderate or severe
    # Moderate corresponds to code 1, severe corresponds to code 3
    nodes[1] = int(X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3])
    
    # Node 2: Nasogastric Reflux is more than 1 liter
    # ">1 liter" corresponds to code 0
    nodes[2] = int(X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0)
    
    # Node 3: Peristalsis is absent
    # Absent corresponds to code 1
    nodes[3] = int(X["peristalsis"] == 1)
    
    # Decision Tree Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Degree of Pain is severe
        prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion (yes)
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Abdominal Distension is moderate or severe
            prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion (yes)
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                # If Nasogastric Reflux is more than 1 liter
                prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion (yes)
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    # If Peristalsis is absent
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion (yes)
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Surgical lesion (no)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if **Degree of Pain** is severe. Severe pain corresponds to codes **2** and **5**.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if **Abdominal Distension** is moderate or severe. Moderate is code **1**, severe is code **3**.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if **Nasogastric Reflux** is more than 1 liter. ">1 liter" is code **0**.
  - `nodes[3]`: Checks if **Peristalsis** is absent. Absent is code **1**.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - The function follows the decision tree:
    - If `nodes[0]` is **1** (Degree of Pain is severe), predict **1** (surgical lesion).
    - Else, check `nodes[1]`. If **1** (Abdominal Distension is moderate or severe), predict **1**.
    - Else, check `nodes[2]`. If **1** (Nasogastric Reflux > 1 liter), predict **1**.
    - Else, check `nodes[3]`. If **1** (Peristalsis is absent), predict **1**.
    - Else, predict **0** (no surgical lesion).

**Usage Example:**

Let's test the function with an example input:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    "surgery": 2,  # Yes
    "Age": 0,  # Adult
    "rectal_temperature": 38.5,
    "pulse": 60,
    "respiratory_rate": 30,
    "temp_extremities": 3,  # Normal
    "peripheral_pulse": 3,  # Normal
    "mucous_membranes": 4,  # Normal pink
    "capillary_refill_time": 1,  # Less than 3 seconds
    "pain": 2,  # Continuous severe pain
    "peristalsis": 1,  # Absent
    "abdominal_distension": 3,  # Severe
    "nasogastric_tube": 2,  # Significant
    "nasogastric_reflux": 0,  # More than 1 liter
    "nasogastric_reflux_PH": 7.0,
    "rectal_examination": 4,  # Normal
    "abdomen": 2,  # Distended small intestine
    "packed_cell_volume": 45,
    "total_protein": 7.5,
    "abdominocentesis_appearance": 2,  # Cloudy
    "abdomcentesis_total_protein": 3.0,
    "outcome": 3  # Lived
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery):", prediction)
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery): 1
Nodes truth values: [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0]` is **1** because `pain` is **2** (continuous severe pain).
- Since `nodes[0]` is **1**, the function predicts **1** (surgical lesion needed).

**Note on Feature Encodings:**

- It's crucial to use the exact keys and encodings as specified.
- The function assumes that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary features with the correct encodings.
- Make sure to handle any missing values or invalid inputs as needed.

**Function Breakdown:**

- **Line 2:** Initializes a list `nodes` with four zeros to store the truth values.
- **Lines 5-8:** Assigns truth values to each node based on the conditions in the decision tree and the feature encodings.
- **Lines 11-20:** Implements the decision tree logic to determine the prediction.
- **Line 22:** Returns the prediction and the list of node truth values.

**Remember:** The nodes correspond to the inner nodes of the decision tree, and their truth values help trace the path taken to arrive at the prediction.
