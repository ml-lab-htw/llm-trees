```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pulse"] > 60
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] > 3  # Assuming pain levels above 3 (intermittent mild pain) are moderate to severe

    if nodes[0]:  # Pulse > 60
        if nodes[1]:  # Pain > moderate
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    else:  # Pulse <= 60
        prediction = 0 # Non-Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  I've added a specific threshold for pain.  Since the "pain" feature is encoded with:
    * 1 = alert
    * 2 = continuous severe pain
    * 3 = depressed
    * 4 = intermittent mild pain
    * 5 = intermittent severe pain

   I've chosen a threshold of `> 3`. This means values 4 (intermittent mild pain) and above are considered to contribute towards a surgical decision in combination with high pulse.

2. **Feature Encoding Consistency:** The code uses the provided feature encodings and the target encoding (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery).

3. **Clearer Logic:**  The if/else structure more directly mirrors the decision tree logic, enhancing readability.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_horse = {
    'surgery': 2,  # Yes (but pretend we don't know this yet)
    'Age': 0,  # Adult
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 80,  # High
    'respiratory_rate': 24,
    'temp_extremities': 2, # Cool
    'peripheral_pulse': 3, # Normal
    'mucous_membranes': 4, # Normal pink
    'capillary_refill_time': 1, # < 3 seconds
    'pain': 5, # Intermittent Severe pain
    'peristalsis': 3, # Hypomotile
    'abdominal_distension': 3, # Severe
    'nasogastric_tube': 1, # None
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3, # None
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None, # Missing Value - Handling not shown in simple tree
    'rectal_examination': 3, # Increased
    'abdomen': 2, # Distended small
    'packed_cell_volume': 45,
    'total_protein': 7.0,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 2, # Cloudy
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 3.5,
    'outcome': 1, # Died (Again, pretend we don't know this)
}


prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction (0=No Surgery, 1=Surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```


This example would predict "Surgery" (1) because the pulse is > 60 and the pain is > 3.  The node truth values would be `[True, True]`.


Remember that this decision tree is still highly simplified. A real-world application would involve significantly more features, sophisticated analysis to determine thresholds and feature importance, and careful consideration of the complex nature of colic diagnosis.  It is crucial to consult with a veterinarian for any suspected case of colic.
