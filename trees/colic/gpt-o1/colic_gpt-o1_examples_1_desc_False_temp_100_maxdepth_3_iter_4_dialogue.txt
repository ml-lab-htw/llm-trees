Certainly! Based on the decision tree provided earlier and the exact feature keys and encodings you've specified, here's the Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list for the nodes

    # Node 0: Is the Degree of Pain severe?
    # Severe pain is encoded as 2 (continuous severe pain) or 5 (intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['pain'] in [2, 5] else 0
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        # Node 1: Is the Abdominal Distension severe or moderate?
        # Severe distension is encoded as 3, moderate as 1
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3] else 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            # Node 2: Is the Pulse Rate > 80 bpm?
            nodes[2] = 1 if X['pulse'] > 80 else 0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain.
  - **Condition:** `X['pain']` is either 2 (continuous severe pain) or 5 (intermittent severe pain).
  - **Action:** If severe pain, predict **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
- **Node 1:** If not severe pain, checks for abdominal distension.
  - **Condition:** `X['abdominal_distension']` is either 1 (moderate) or 3 (severe).
  - **Action:** If moderate or severe distension, predict **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
- **Node 2:** If distension is slight or none, checks the pulse rate.
  - **Condition:** `X['pulse'] > 80` beats per minute.
  - **Action:** If pulse rate is elevated above 80 bpm, predict **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Else:** If pulse rate is 80 bpm or less, predict **Non-Surgical** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage:**

You can use this function by passing a dictionary `X` containing the required features with their exact keys and values according to the encodings you've provided.

**Example:**

```python
# Sample input data
X = {
    'pain': 3,                   # Depressed
    'abdominal_distension': 2,   # None
    'pulse': 88                  # Pulse rate in bpm
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Surgical' if prediction == 1 else 'Non-Surgical'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgical
Node Truth Values: [0, 0, 1]
```

**Explanation of the Output:**

- **Node Truth Values:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0` (Pain is not severe)
  - `nodes[1] = 0` (No abdominal distension)
  - `nodes[2] = 1` (Pulse rate is greater than 80 bpm)
- Since the third node condition is satisfied (elevated pulse rate), the prediction is **Surgical**.

**Notes:**

- Ensure that all the required keys are present in the input dictionary `X`.
- The pulse rate should be provided as a numeric value (integer or float).
- The function assumes that the values for 'pain' and 'abdominal_distension' are provided according to the specified encodings.

**Feature Encodings Used:**

- **pain (Degree of Pain):**
  - Severe Pain: 2 (continuous severe pain), 5 (intermittent severe pain)
  - Moderate/Mild/No Pain: 1, 3, 4
- **abdominal_distension (Abdominal Distension):**
  - Severe Distension: 3
  - Moderate Distension: 1
  - Slight/None: 2, 4
- **pulse (Pulse Rate):**
  - Numeric value representing beats per minute.

**Function Summary:**

- **Input:** `X` (dictionary with keys 'pain', 'abdominal_distension', 'pulse')
- **Output:** Tuple containing:
  - `prediction`: 0 (Non-Surgical), 1 (Surgical)
  - `nodes`: List of truth values for each node condition

This function implements the decision tree accurately, uses meaningful thresholds, and adheres to the feature encodings and keys you've specified.
