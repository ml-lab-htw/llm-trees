```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Mapping pain levels to severity scores
    pain_severity_mapping = {
        1: 1,  # alert (none)
        2: 5,  # continuous severe pain (severe)
        3: 3,  # depressed (moderate)
        4: 2,  # intermittent mild pain (mild)
        5: 4   # intermittent severe pain (severe)
    }
    
    # Mapping abdominal distension to severity scores
    abdominal_distension_severity_mapping = {
        2: 1,  # none
        4: 2,  # slight
        1: 3,  # moderate
        3: 4   # severe
    }
    
    # Calculate severity scores based on the provided mappings
    pain_severity = pain_severity_mapping.get(X['pain'], 3)  # Default to moderate if key not found
    abdominal_distension_severity = abdominal_distension_severity_mapping.get(X['abdominal_distension'], 2)  # Default to slight if key not found
    
    # Node 0: Check if pain severity is less than or equal to 2 (none or mild)
    nodes[0] = int(pain_severity <= 2)
    # Node 1: Check if abdominal distension severity is less than or equal to 2 (none or slight)
    nodes[1] = int(abdominal_distension_severity <= 2)
    
    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0**: We evaluate the **Degree of Pain**.
  - We map the `pain` feature to a severity score using `pain_severity_mapping`.
    - `pain_severity <= 2` corresponds to **none** or **mild** pain.
  - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), we classify it as **Non-surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
  
- **Node 1**: If the pain is not none or mild, we evaluate the **Abdominal Distension**.
  - We map the `abdominal_distension` feature to a severity score using `abdominal_distension_severity_mapping`.
    - `abdominal_distension_severity <= 2` corresponds to **none** or **slight** distension.
  - If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] = 1`), we classify it as **Non-surgical** (`prediction = 0`).
  - Otherwise (`nodes[1] = 0`), we classify it as **Surgical** (`prediction = 1`).

### Note:

- **Default Values**: In the mappings, I used default severity scores if a key is not found to handle any unexpected input values.
  - For `pain`, the default severity is set to `3` (moderate).
  - For `abdominal_distension`, the default severity is set to `2` (slight).

- **Feature Keys**: The feature keys used in the function match exactly with the ones you've provided.

- **Encoding**: The function takes into account the specific encodings of the features.

### Usage Example:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    'pain': 4,                   # intermittent mild pain
    'abdominal_distension': 2,   # none
    # ... other features can be included but are not used in this function
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction (0=Non-surgical, 1=Surgical):", prediction)
print("Node evaluations (1=True, 0=False):", nodes)
```

### Sample Output:

```
Prediction (0=Non-surgical, 1=Surgical): 0
Node evaluations (1=True, 0=False): [1, 1]
```

In this example:

- **Node 0**: `pain` is 4 (intermittent mild pain), mapped to severity 2, so `nodes[0] = 1` (True).
- **Node 1**: Not evaluated since the first condition is True.
- **Prediction**: `0` (Non-surgical).
