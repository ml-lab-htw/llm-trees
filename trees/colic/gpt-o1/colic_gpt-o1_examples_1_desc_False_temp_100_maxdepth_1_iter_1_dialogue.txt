Sure! Below is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 1  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' indicates moderate or severe pain
    # pain encoding:
    # 1 = alert (none)
    # 2 = continuous severe pain
    # 3 = depressed (moderate pain)
    # 4 = intermittent mild pain
    # 5 = intermittent severe pain
    severe_pain_values = [2, 3, 5]  # Values indicating moderate or severe pain

    # Evaluate the condition for Node 0
    condition = X["pain"] in severe_pain_values
    nodes[0] = int(condition)  # 1 if condition is True, 0 otherwise

    if condition:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical Lesion (needs surgery)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical Lesion (does not need surgery)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `pain` (Degree of Pain)
    - **Encodings:**
        - `1`: alert (none)
        - `2`: continuous severe pain
        - `3`: depressed (moderate pain)
        - `4`: intermittent mild pain
        - `5`: intermittent severe pain
- **Node Condition:**
    - We check if the `pain` value is in `[2, 3, 5]`, which represent moderate to severe pain levels.
    - These pain levels are critical indicators that the horse may require surgical intervention.
- **Prediction:**
    - If the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), we predict `1` (surgical lesion).
    - If not (`nodes[0] = 0`), we predict `0` (non-surgical lesion).
- **Returned Values:**
    - `prediction`: The classification result (`0` or `1`).
    - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value (`1` or `0`) of the node condition.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where pain is 'continuous severe pain' (value 2)
X_example = {
    "pain": 2
    # ... other features can be included as needed
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

In this example, since the `pain` value is `2`, which indicates continuous severe pain, the condition in the node is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), and the function predicts `1`, meaning a surgical lesion.

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the key `"pain"` with a value corresponding to the specified encoding. Other feature keys can be included in `X` but are not used in this decision tree.
