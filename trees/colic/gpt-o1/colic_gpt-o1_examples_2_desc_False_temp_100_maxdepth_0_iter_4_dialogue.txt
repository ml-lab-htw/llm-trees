Certainly! Based on your requirements and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    # Node 0: Degree of Pain == severe
    nodes[0] = (X['pain'] == 2) or (X['pain'] == 5)  # 2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
    
    # Node 1: Pulse > 80 bpm
    nodes[1] = X['pulse'] > 80
    
    # Node 2: Nasogastric Reflux == >1 liter
    nodes[2] = X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0  # 0 = more than 1 liter
    
    # Node 3: Peristalsis == absent
    nodes[3] = X['peristalsis'] == 1  # 1 = absent
    
    # Node 4: Abdominal Distension == moderate or severe
    nodes[4] = (X['abdominal_distension'] == 1) or (X['abdominal_distension'] == 3)  # 1 = moderate, 3 = severe

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery: Yes
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery: Yes
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery: Yes
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgery: Yes
                else:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Surgery: Yes
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Surgery: No
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain. According to the encoding:
  - `pain == 2` (continuous severe pain)
  - `pain == 5` (intermittent severe pain)
  If either condition is true, the function predicts that surgery is necessary (`prediction = 1`).

- **Node 1:** If the pain isn't severe, it checks if the pulse rate is greater than 80 bpm (`pulse > 80`). A high pulse rate indicates a serious condition, leading to a prediction of surgery.

- **Node 2:** If the pulse rate is not high, it checks if the nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter:
  - `nasogastric_reflux == 0` (0 = more than 1 liter)
  A large amount of reflux suggests a blockage, indicating surgery.

- **Node 3:** If there's not significant nasogastric reflux, it checks if peristalsis (gut movement) is absent:
  - `peristalsis == 1` (1 = absent)
  Absence of peristalsis is a critical sign often requiring surgery.

- **Node 4:** If peristalsis is present, it checks the level of abdominal distension:
  - `abdominal_distension == 1` (moderate)
  - `abdominal_distension == 3` (severe)
  Moderate to severe distension may necessitate surgery.

- If none of the above conditions indicate surgery, the function predicts that surgery is not necessary (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you might use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    'pain': 4,                   # intermittent mild pain
    'pulse': 65,                 # beats per minute
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,     # none
    'peristalsis': 4,            # normal
    'abdominal_distension': 2    # none
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction (0=No Surgery, 1=Surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Conditions: {nodes}")
```

**Interpreting the Output:**

- The `prediction` will be `0` or `1`, indicating whether surgery is needed.
- The `nodes` list contains boolean values corresponding to each node's condition:
  - `True` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `False` otherwise.

**Feature Keys and Encodings Used:**

- **pain:** Degree of Pain
  - `1 = alert`
  - `2 = continuous severe pain`
  - `3 = depressed`
  - `4 = intermittent mild pain`
  - `5 = intermittent severe pain`

- **pulse:** Pulse (beats per minute)

- **nasogastric_reflux:** Nasogastric Reflux
  - `0 = more than 1 liter`
  - `1 = less than 1 liter`
  - `2 = missing`
  - `3 = none`

- **peristalsis:** Gut sounds
  - `1 = absent`
  - `2 = hypermotile`
  - `3 = hypomotile`
  - `4 = normal`

- **abdominal_distension:** Abdominal Distension
  - `1 = moderate`
  - `2 = none`
  - `3 = severe`
  - `4 = slight`

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values.
- The function follows the decision tree logic exactly as specified.
- All node conditions are precomputed and stored in the `nodes` list as per your examples.

**Testing the Function:**

You can test the function with different input values to see how the prediction changes:

```python
# Test case where surgery is predicted
X_test1 = {
    'pain': 2,                   # continuous severe pain
    'pulse': 90,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0,
    'peristalsis': 1,
    'abdominal_distension': 3
}

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X_test1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True, True, True, True]

# Test case where surgery is not predicted
X_test2 = {
    'pain': 4,                   # intermittent mild pain
    'pulse': 70,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,     # none
    'peristalsis': 4,            # normal
    'abdominal_distension': 2    # none
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X_test2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}, Nodes: {nodes2}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False, False, False, False, False]
```
