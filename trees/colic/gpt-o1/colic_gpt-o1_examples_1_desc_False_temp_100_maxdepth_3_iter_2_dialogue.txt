Certainly! Based on the decision tree provided and using the exact feature keys and encodings you've specified, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    # Node 0: Check if Degree of Pain indicates severe pain
    nodes[0] = X['pain'] in [2, 5]  # 2: continuous severe pain, 5: intermittent severe pain
    # Node 1: Check if Abdominal Distension is moderate or severe
    nodes[1] = X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]  # 1: moderate, 3: severe

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `'pain'`: Degree of Pain
  - `'abdominal_distension'`: Abdominal Distension

- **Encodings Used:**
  - **Degree of Pain (`'pain'`):**
    - `2`: continuous severe pain
    - `5`: intermittent severe pain
  - **Abdominal Distension (`'abdominal_distension'`):**
    - `1`: moderate
    - `3`: severe

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain.
    - `True` if `X['pain']` is `2` or `5`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if there is moderate or severe abdominal distension.
    - `True` if `X['abdominal_distension']` is `1` or `3`.

- **Prediction:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (severe pain), predict `1` (Surgical).
  - Else, if `nodes[1]` is `True` (moderate or severe distension), predict `1` (Surgical).
  - Else, predict `0` (Non-surgical).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'pain': 2,  # continuous severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 2  # none
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Surgical" if prediction == 1 else "Non-surgical")
print("Node Evaluations:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgical
Node Evaluations: [1, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `1` (True) because `pain` is `2` (continuous severe pain).
- `nodes[1]` is `0` (False) because `abdominal_distension` is `2` (none).
- Since `nodes[0]` is `True`, the prediction is `1` (Surgical).

**Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the keys `'pain'` and `'abdominal_distension'` with appropriate integer values as per the provided encodings.
- The prediction is `0` for Non-surgical and `1` for Surgical, matching the target variable encoding.
