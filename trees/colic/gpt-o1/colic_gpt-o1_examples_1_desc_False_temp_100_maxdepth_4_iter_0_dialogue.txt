Here is the Python function based on the given decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'pain' indicates severe pain
    # 'pain' encoding:
    # 2 = continuous severe pain
    # 5 = intermittent severe pain
    nodes[0] = int(X['pain'] in [2, 5])

    if nodes[0]:  # If severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if 'abdominal_distension' is moderate or severe
        # 'abdominal_distension' encoding:
        # 1 = moderate
        # 3 = severe
        nodes[1] = int(X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3])

        if nodes[1]:  # If moderate or severe abdominal distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if 'capillary_refill_time' >= 3 seconds
            # 'capillary_refill_time' encoding:
            # 0 = more than 3 seconds
            nodes[2] = int(X['capillary_refill_time'] == 0)

            if nodes[2]:  # If capillary refill time is >= 3 seconds
                prediction = 1  # Surgical lesion
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Not a surgical lesion

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0** checks if the horse is experiencing **severe pain**. According to the feature encoding:
  - `pain == 2` corresponds to "continuous severe pain"
  - `pain == 5` corresponds to "intermittent severe pain"
  So, we check if `X['pain']` is in `[2, 5]`.

- **Node 1** (executed if Node 0 condition is not satisfied) checks for **abdominal distension** being moderate or severe:
  - `abdominal_distension == 1` corresponds to "moderate"
  - `abdominal_distension == 3` corresponds to "severe"
  So, we check if `X['abdominal_distension']` is in `[1, 3]`.

- **Node 2** (executed if Node 1 condition is not satisfied) checks if **capillary refill time** is greater than or equal to 3 seconds:
  - `capillary_refill_time == 0` corresponds to "more than 3 seconds" (i.e., `>= 3 seconds`)
  So, we check if `X['capillary_refill_time'] == 0`.

- The `nodes` list captures the truth value (1 for `True`, 0 for `False`) of each node's condition in the order they are evaluated.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a horse with the following features:

```python
horse_features = {
    'pain': 4,                   # intermittent mild pain
    'abdominal_distension': 2,   # none
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,  # less than 3 seconds
    # other features are not used in this tree
}
```

We can predict whether the lesion is surgical:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(horse_features)
print("Prediction:", "Surgical lesion" if prediction == 1 else "Not a surgical lesion")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Not a surgical lesion
Nodes truth values: [0, 0, 0]
```

This means that none of the conditions in the decision tree were satisfied (`nodes` are all 0), and the lesion is predicted to **not** be surgical.

**Note on Feature Encodings:**

- Make sure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys and encoding as specified:

  - `'pain'`: integer values from 1 to 5
  - `'abdominal_distension'`: integer values from 1 to 4
  - `'capillary_refill_time'`: integer values where
    - `0` = more than 3 seconds
    - `1` = less than 3 seconds
    - `2` = missing
    - `3` = meaning unknown

- The function assumes that all required features are present in `X` and that their values are correctly encoded.
