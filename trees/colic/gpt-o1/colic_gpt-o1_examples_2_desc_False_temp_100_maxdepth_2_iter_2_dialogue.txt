Sure! Based on the decision tree we previously discussed and using the exact feature keys and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function formatted as per your request:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the "pain" level indicates severe pain
    # Encodings for severe pain are 2 (continuous severe pain) and 5 (intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
    
    # Node 1: Check if "pulse" is greater than 80 beats per minute
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 80
    
    # Decision Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical lesion
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical lesion
        else:
            prediction = 0  # not surgical lesion
    
    # Convert boolean nodes to integers (1 for True, 0 for False)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0**: Checks if the horse is experiencing severe pain.
  - `X["pain"] in [2, 5]` evaluates to `True` if the "pain" feature has a value of 2 or 5, corresponding to "continuous severe pain" or "intermittent severe pain."
- **Node 1**: Checks if the horse's pulse rate is elevated.
  - `X["pulse"] > 80` evaluates to `True` if the pulse rate is greater than 80 beats per minute.
- **Decision Logic**:
  - If **Node 0** is `True` (the horse is in severe pain), we predict `1` (surgical lesion).
  - Else, we proceed to **Node 1**.
    - If **Node 1** is `True` (pulse rate is high), we predict `1` (surgical lesion).
    - If **Node 1** is `False` (pulse rate is not high), we predict `0` (not surgical lesion).
- **Nodes List**:
  - We convert the boolean values in `nodes` to integers (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`) as per your requirement.
  - The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes:
    - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition at **Node 0**.
    - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition at **Node 1**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'surgery': 2,
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.5,
    'pulse': 85,
    'respiratory_rate': 30,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 2,
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 2,
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': 7.5,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 45,
    'total_protein': 7.0,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'outcome': 3
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = surgical lesion, 0 = not surgical lesion)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes} (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied)")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1 (1 = surgical lesion, 0 = not surgical lesion)
Nodes: [1, 1] (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied)
```

In this example:

- **Node 0** evaluates to `1` because `X_example["pain"]` is `2` (continuous severe pain).
- Since **Node 0** is `True`, the prediction is `1` (surgical lesion), and we do not need to evaluate **Node 1** for this prediction.

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains all the necessary keys spelled exactly as specified.
- The function strictly follows the decision tree logic with a maximum depth of 2, using the most important features related to predicting whether a horse colic lesion is surgical.
