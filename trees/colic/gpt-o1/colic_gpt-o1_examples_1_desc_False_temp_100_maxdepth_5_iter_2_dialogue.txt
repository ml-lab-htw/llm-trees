```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the horse is experiencing severe pain
    nodes[0] = X['pain'] in [2, 5]  # 2: continuous severe pain, 5: intermittent severe pain
    if nodes[0]:
        # If severe pain, predict surgery is needed
        prediction = 1
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the horse is experiencing moderate pain
        nodes[1] = X['pain'] == 3  # 3: depressed (interpreted as moderate pain)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if there is significant nasogastric reflux
            nodes[2] = X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0  # 0: more than 1 liter (significant)
            if nodes[2]:
                # If significant reflux, predict surgery is needed
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # If not, predict surgery is not needed
                prediction = 0
        else:
            # Node 3: Check for severe or moderate abdominal distension
            nodes[3] = X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]  # 1: moderate, 3: severe
            if nodes[3]:
                # If distension is severe or moderate, predict surgery is needed
                prediction = 1
            else:
                # Node 4: Check if pulse rate is greater than 80 bpm
                nodes[4] = X['pulse'] > 80
                if nodes[4]:
                    # If pulse is high, predict surgery is needed
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    # If not, predict surgery is not needed
                    prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes  # Return the prediction and the list of node truth values
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0**: Checks if `pain` is severe.
  - `X['pain'] in [2, 5]` means the pain level is either "continuous severe pain" or "intermittent severe pain".
- **Node 1**: If not severe pain, checks if `pain` is moderate.
  - `X['pain'] == 3` corresponds to "depressed", interpreted here as moderate pain.
- **Node 2**: If moderate pain, checks if `nasogastric_reflux` is significant.
  - `X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0` indicates more than 1 liter of reflux, considered significant.
- **Node 3**: If mild or no pain, checks for severe or moderate `abdominal_distension`.
  - `X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]` corresponds to "moderate" or "severe" distension.
- **Node 4**: If distension is slight or none, checks if `pulse` is greater than 80 bpm.

**Note on Feature Encoding:**

- **pain**:
  - 1: alert (mild or no pain)
  - 2: continuous severe pain (severe)
  - 3: depressed (moderate)
  - 4: intermittent mild pain (mild or no pain)
  - 5: intermittent severe pain (severe)
- **nasogastric_reflux**:
  - 0: more than 1 liter (significant reflux)
  - 1: less than 1 liter (slight reflux)
  - 3: none
- **abdominal_distension**:
  - 1: moderate
  - 2: none
  - 3: severe
  - 4: slight
- **pulse**:
  - Numerical value representing beats per minute.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'pain': 2,  # continuous severe pain
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0,  # more than 1 liter
    'abdominal_distension': 3,  # severe
    'pulse': 85
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Surgery Needed" if prediction == 1 else "No Surgery Needed")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgery Needed
Node Truth Values: [True, None, None, None, None]
```

In this example, since the horse is experiencing continuous severe pain, the first node evaluates to `True`, and the prediction is that surgery is needed. The nodes list shows the truth value of each inner node, with `True` or `False` indicating whether the condition was satisfied.
