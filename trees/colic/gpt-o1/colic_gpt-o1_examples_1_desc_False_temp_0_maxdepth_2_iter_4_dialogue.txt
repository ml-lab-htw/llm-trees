```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # Pain greater than mild/alert (using a proxy threshold since encoding doesn't directly map to mild/moderate/severe)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 2 # Abdominal distension greater than slight/none (again, a proxy threshold due to encoding).


    if nodes[0]:  # If pain > mild/alert
        if nodes[1]:  # AND Abdominal distension > slight/none
            prediction = 1  # Likely surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Potentially medical, more investigation needed
    else: # If Pain is mild/alert or less
        prediction = 0  # Likely medical

    return prediction, nodes
```



**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  The original pain and distension encodings don't perfectly align with "mild," "moderate," "slight," etc.  I've used proxy thresholds (pain > 2, distension > 2) which roughly correspond to increasing severity.  With real data analysis, these thresholds could be optimized.  Ideally, re-encode the pain and distension to ordinal scales.
2. **Missing Value Handling:** The function currently assumes no missing values.  In reality, you'd need to add checks (e.g., `if X["pain"] is not None: ...`) and handle missing values appropriately (imputation, using a default branch in the tree, etc.).
3. **Feature Encoding:** The provided encodings for some features (especially pain, distension) are not ideal for a decision tree. Ordinal encoding (1, 2, 3... for increasing severity) would be better.  One-hot encoding may be needed for nominal features like mucous membranes if used in a more complex tree.
4. **Limited Depth:** This depth-2 tree is very basic.  A more sophisticated model is necessary for accurate predictions in a real-world scenario.  Explore greater depths or alternative models once the data is properly preprocessed.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_horse = {
    'surgery': None,  # Irrelevant for prediction
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.0, # Example values
    'pulse': 60, # Example value
    'respiratory_rate': 20, #Example value
    # ... (other features)
    'pain': 4, # Intermittent Mild Pain
    'abdominal_distension': 1, # Moderate
     #... (other features)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 (No surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [False, False] (Both conditions false)



example_horse2 = {
    # ... (other features)
    'pain': 5, # Intermittent severe pain
    'abdominal_distension': 3, # severe
    # ... (other features)
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_horse2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}") # Output: 1 (Surgery)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")  # Output: [True, True] (Both conditions true)
```



This improved version gives a more practical function, but remember that optimizing the thresholds and using a more complex model is crucial for a clinically useful prediction tool.
