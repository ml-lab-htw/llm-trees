```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["pulse"] <= 88  # Inner node condition

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical (0 = no surgery)
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Surgical (1 = surgery)
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Used:** `"pulse"`
  - The `pulse` feature represents the **Pulse (beats per minute)** of the horse.
  - It is a numerical feature without specific encoding, so we use it directly.

- **Threshold Value:** `88`
  - We use `88` beats per minute as the threshold based on veterinary guidelines indicating high severity when the pulse exceeds this value.

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes = [None] * 1` initializes a list to hold the truth value of the inner node condition.
  - `nodes[0]` stores the boolean result of the condition `X["pulse"] <= 88`.

- **Prediction:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., `pulse` is less than or equal to `88`), the function predicts `0`, indicating **Non-Surgical**.
  - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (i.e., `pulse` is greater than `88`), the function predicts `1`, indicating **Surgical**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the horse's pulse is 80 bpm
X_sample = {
    "pulse": 80,
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this prediction
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True]
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` includes the key `"pulse"` with the horse's pulse rate as its value.
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The classification result (`0` for Non-Surgical, `1` for Surgical).
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth value of the inner node condition(s).

**Feature and Target Encoding Reference:**

- **Feature Key Used:**
  - `"pulse"`: Pulse (beats per minute)

- **Target Variable:**
  - `target`: Indicates whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.
    - `0`: No surgery (Non-Surgical)
    - `1`: Surgery required (Surgical)
