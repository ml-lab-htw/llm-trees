```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["pain"] > 2  # If pain is greater than mild/alert (using a simplified threshold based on the pain scale)
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 60  # If pulse is greater than 60 bpm

    if nodes[0]:  # Significant pain
        if nodes[1]:  # High pulse
            prediction = 1  # Likely surgery
        else:  # Normal/low pulse
            prediction = 0  # Possibly no surgery, but further investigation needed (simplified for depth 2)
    else:  # Mild or no pain
        prediction = 0  # Likely no surgery


    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:**  I've used more appropriate thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions.  `pain > 2` captures moderate to severe pain levels. `pulse > 60` is a reasonable (but still simplified) threshold for elevated heart rate in a horse.
* **Logic:** The logic now reflects the hypothetical decision tree discussed earlier.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code correctly uses the numerical encodings provided for the `pain` feature.
* **Clinical Relevance (Caveat):** I want to reiterate that this is still a *simplified example*.  A depth-2 tree is very unlikely to be accurate for such a complex medical diagnosis.  In a real-world application, you absolutely **must** use a larger dataset and a more sophisticated approach.  Consult with veterinary experts for proper feature engineering, model selection, and validation.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_horse = {
    'surgery': None,  # We're predicting this
    'Age': 0,
    'rectal_temperature': 38.0,
    'pulse': 80,
    'respiratory_rate': 20,
    'temp_extremities': 3,
    'peripheral_pulse': 3,
    'mucous_membranes': 4,
    'capillary_refill_time': 1,
    'pain': 4, # intermittent mild pain
    'peristalsis': 4,
    'abdominal_distension': 2,
    'nasogastric_tube': 1,
    'nasogastric_reflux': 3,
    'nasogastric_reflux_PH': None,
    'rectal_examination': 4,
    'abdomen': 4,
    'packed_cell_volume': 40,
    'total_protein': 6.5,
    'abdominocentesis_appearance': 1,
    'abdomcentesis_total_protein': 2.0,
    'outcome': None
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_horse)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 or 1
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True] or a similar list of booleans
```


Remember to replace this example with a properly trained model when working with real-world medical data.  This example serves only as an illustration of the requested function format.
