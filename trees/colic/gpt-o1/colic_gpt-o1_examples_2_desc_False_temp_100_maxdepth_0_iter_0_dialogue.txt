Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 3  # Initialize a list of 3 nodes with 0 (false)

    # Node 0: Check if Degree of Pain is severe (values 2 or 5)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['pain'] in [2, 5] else 0

    # Node 1: Check if Nasogastric Reflux is more than 1 liter (value 0)
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0 else 0

    # Node 2: Check if Abdominal Distension is severe or moderate (values 1 or 3)
    nodes[2] = 1 if X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3] else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Surgery: yes
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery: yes
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery: yes
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Surgery: no

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if `pain` is severe. According to the encoding:
  - Severe pain corresponds to values **2 (continuous severe pain)** and **5 (intermittent severe pain)**.
  - The condition `X['pain'] in [2, 5]` evaluates to `True` if the pain is severe.
  
- **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if `nasogastric_reflux` is more than 1 liter. According to the encoding:
  - More than 1 liter corresponds to value **0**.
  - The condition `X['nasogastric_reflux'] == 0` evaluates to `True` if nasogastric reflux is more than 1 liter.
  
- **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):** Checks if `abdominal_distension` is severe or moderate. According to the encoding:
  - Severe corresponds to value **3**.
  - Moderate corresponds to value **1**.
  - The condition `X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3]` evaluates to `True` if abdominal distension is severe or moderate.
  
- **Prediction Logic:**
  - If **Node 0** is `True` (pain is severe), predict **surgery = yes**.
  - Else, if **Node 1** is `True` (nasogastric reflux > 1 liter), predict **surgery = yes**.
  - Else, if **Node 2** is `True` (abdominal distension is severe or moderate), predict **surgery = yes**.
  - Else, predict **surgery = no**.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'pain': 2,  # continuous severe pain
    'nasogastric_reflux': 1,  # less than 1 liter
    'abdominal_distension': 2,  # none
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this decision tree
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction (0=no surgery, 1=surgery): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction (0=no surgery, 1=surgery): 1
Nodes: [1, 0, 0]
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the keys exactly as specified:

- `'pain'`
- `'nasogastric_reflux'`
- `'abdominal_distension'`

Finally, remember that the encodings for each feature must match the ones provided:

- `pain`:
  - 1 = alert
  - 2 = continuous severe pain
  - 3 = depressed
  - 4 = intermittent mild pain
  - 5 = intermittent severe pain
- `nasogastric_reflux`:
  - 0 = more than 1 liter
  - 1 = less than 1 liter
  - 2 = missing
  - 3 = none
- `abdominal_distension`:
  - 1 = moderate
  - 2 = none
  - 3 = severe
  - 4 = slight

**Interpretation of Nodes List:**

- `nodes[0]`: **1** if the horse is experiencing severe pain, **0** otherwise.
- `nodes[1]`: **1** if there is more than 1 liter of nasogastric reflux, **0** otherwise.
- `nodes[2]`: **1** if the abdominal distension is severe or moderate, **0** otherwise.

These nodes help trace the path taken in the decision tree to arrive at the prediction.
