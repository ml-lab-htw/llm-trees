Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree you requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4

    # Node 0: Is the degree of pain severe?
    nodes[0] = int(X["pain"] in [2, 5])  # 2: continuous severe pain, 5: intermittent severe pain

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Is the abdomen distended (small or large intestine)?
        nodes[1] = int(X["abdomen"] in [1, 2])  # 1: distended large, 2: distended small
        # Nodes 2 and 3 are not evaluated in this branch
        nodes[2] = 0
        nodes[3] = 0

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    else:
        nodes[1] = 0  # Not evaluated in this branch
        # Node 2: Is the pulse rate >= 80 beats per minute?
        nodes[2] = int(X["pulse"] >= 80)

        if nodes[2]:
            # Node 3: Is nasogastric reflux more than 1 liter?
            nodes[3] = int(X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0)  # 0: more than 1 liter
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            nodes[3] = 0  # Not evaluated in this branch
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if the **degree of pain** is severe.
  - Severe pain corresponds to codes **2** (continuous severe pain) and **5** (intermittent severe pain) in the `pain` feature.
- **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** If severe pain, checks if the **abdomen appearance** is distended.
  - Distended abdomen corresponds to codes **1** (distended large intestine) and **2** (distended small intestine) in the `abdomen` feature.
- **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):** If pain is not severe, checks if the **pulse** rate is **80 beats per minute or higher**.
- **Node 3 (`nodes[3]`):** If pulse is high, checks if **nasogastric reflux** is more than 1 liter.
  - More than 1 liter corresponds to code **0** in the `nasogastric_reflux` feature.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input data for a horse:

```python
X = {
    'pain': 2,                # continuous severe pain
    'abdomen': 1,             # distended large intestine
    'pulse': 85,              # beats per minute
    'nasogastric_reflux': 0   # more than 1 liter
    # Other features can be included as well
}
```

Calling the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Surgical" if prediction == 1 else "Non-surgical")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Surgical
Nodes: [1, 1, 0, 0]
```

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: The condition "pain is severe" is **True**.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: The abdomen is distended (large or small).
  - `nodes[2] = 0`: Not evaluated (since `nodes[0]` is True).
  - `nodes[3] = 0`: Not evaluated.

**Note:**

- The function assumes all required features are present in the input dictionary `X`.
- The prediction is returned as `0` for Non-surgical and `1` for Surgical, as per the target variable encoding.
- The `nodes` list contains `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
- The conditions and thresholds used are based on meaningful medical values derived from the dataset and feature encodings you provided.

**Feature Encodings Used in the Function:**

- **pain:**
  - `2`: continuous severe pain
  - `5`: intermittent severe pain
- **abdomen:**
  - `1`: distended large intestine
  - `2`: distended small intestine
- **pulse:**
  - Value in beats per minute; threshold at `80`.
- **nasogastric_reflux:**
  - `0`: more than 1 liter
  - `1`: less than 1 liter
  - `3`: none
