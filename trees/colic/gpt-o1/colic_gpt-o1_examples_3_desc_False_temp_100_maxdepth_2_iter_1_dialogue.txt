```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if Degree of Pain is 'none' or 'mild'
    # Encoded as pain values 1 (alert) or 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["pain"] in [1, 4] else 0

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # If the condition at Node 0 is satisfied
        prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical Lesion
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Abdominal Distension is 'none' or 'slight'
        # Encoded as abdominal_distension values 2 (none) or 4 (slight)
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["abdominal_distension"] in [2, 4] else 0

        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical Lesion
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical Lesion

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the **Degree of Pain** is either **'alert' (1)** or **'intermittent mild pain' (4)**.
  - If **yes** (`nodes[0] == 1`), predicts **Non-Surgical Lesion** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If **no** (`nodes[0] == 0`), moves to **Node 1**.
- **Node 1:** Checks if the **Abdominal Distension** is either **'none' (2)** or **'slight' (4)**.
  - If **yes** (`nodes[1] == 1`), predicts **Non-Surgical Lesion** (`prediction = 0`).
  - If **no** (`nodes[1] == 0`), predicts **Surgical Lesion** (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where pain is 'intermittent severe pain' (5) and abdominal_distension is 'severe' (3)
X_example = {
    'pain': 5,
    'abdominal_distension': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Surgical Lesion)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [0, 0]
```

**Note:** Make sure to use the exact feature keys as provided and to input the encoded numerical values for categorical features.

**Feature Encodings Used:**

- **pain** (Degree of Pain):
  - 1: alert
  - 2: continuous severe pain
  - 3: depressed
  - 4: intermittent mild pain
  - 5: intermittent severe pain

- **abdominal_distension** (Abdominal Distension):
  - 1: moderate
  - 2: none
  - 3: severe
  - 4: slight

**Target Variable:**

- **prediction**:
  - 0: Non-Surgical Lesion
  - 1: Surgical Lesion

This function follows the structure and formatting of the examples provided and uses meaningful values based on the feature encodings to replicate the decision tree accurately.
