```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2

    # Node 0: Abdominal Distension is 'moderate' (1) or 'severe' (3)
    nodes[0] = int(X['abdominal_distension'] in [1, 3])

    # Node 1: Degree of Pain is 'none' (1) or 'mild' (4)
    nodes[1] = int(X['pain'] in [1, 4])

    if nodes[0]:  # Abdominal Distension is moderate or severe
        prediction = 1  # Lesion is Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Degree of Pain is none or mild
            prediction = 0  # Lesion is Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lesion is Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if `abdominal_distension` is either 'moderate' (code 1) or 'severe' (code 3).
- **Node 1:** Checks if `pain` is either 'none' (code 1) or 'mild' (code 4).

**Feature Encoding Used:**

- **abdominal_distension:**
  - 1 = moderate
  - 2 = none
  - 3 = severe
  - 4 = slight

- **pain:**
  - 1 = alert (interpreted as 'none')
  - 2 = continuous severe pain
  - 3 = depressed
  - 4 = intermittent mild pain (interpreted as 'mild')
  - 5 = intermittent severe pain

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input features
X_example = {
    'abdominal_distension': 1,  # moderate
    'pain': 4,                  # intermittent mild pain
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Lesion is Surgical" if prediction == 1 else "Lesion is Not Surgical")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This function evaluates the conditions based on the most significant features and returns:

- `prediction`: `0` for "Lesion is Not Surgical", `1` for "Lesion is Surgical".
- `nodes`: A list of binary values indicating whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`).
