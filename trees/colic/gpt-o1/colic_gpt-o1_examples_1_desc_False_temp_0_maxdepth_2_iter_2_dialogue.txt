```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # Severe distension
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 100  # High pulse rate

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
    else:
        if X["pain"] == 2 or X["pain"] == 5: # Continuous severe or intermittent severe pain
             prediction = 1 # Surgical
        else:
             prediction = 0 # Non-surgical



    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Threshold Selection:** I've chosen a pulse threshold of > 100 bpm as a possible indicator for surgical intervention.  This is a *guess* and would need refinement with veterinary input and data analysis. For abdominal distension, the encoding translates 3 to "severe". For pain, 2 translates to "continuous severe pain" and 5 translates to "intermittent severe pain".
2. **Handling Missing Data:** This function assumes complete data. In a real application, you would need to implement strategies for handling missing values (e.g., imputation, using a default value).
3. **Feature Encoding:** The provided encoding for the features is used within the `predict` function.
4. **Depth 2:**  The decision tree strictly adheres to a depth of 2.
5. **Simplified Logic:** The logic is simplified for demonstration.  A real diagnostic process is far more nuanced.
6. **Medical Disclaimer:**  This code is *not* intended for actual veterinary use. It's a simplified example for illustrative purposes.  A real diagnostic tool would require expert input, extensive data, and rigorous testing.


This improved version provides a more concrete example, but still highlights the need for careful consideration of feature selection, thresholding, missing data handling, and most importantly, collaboration with domain experts when dealing with real-world medical applications.
