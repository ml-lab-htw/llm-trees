Based on the feature descriptions and value ranges provided, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check abdominal distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
    # Split between moderate/severe and none/slight
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2
    
    # Node 1: Check pain level (splitting between mild and severe pain categories)
    # 1 = alert, 4 = intermittent mild pain are considered mild
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # Node 2: Check packed cell volume (normal range 32-48%)
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    # Node 3: Check nasogastric reflux (0 = more than 1L, 1 = less than 1L, 2 = missing, 3 = none)
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 1

    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension <= 2
        if nodes[1]:  # mild pain
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # severe pain
            if nodes[2]:  # PCV <= 45
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:  # PCV > 45
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # abdominal_distension > 2
        if nodes[3]:  # minimal reflux
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # significant reflux
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Accounts for the specific encodings of categorical variables
3. Uses clinically relevant thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of boolean values for each node
5. Maintains a maximum depth of 4
6. Uses
