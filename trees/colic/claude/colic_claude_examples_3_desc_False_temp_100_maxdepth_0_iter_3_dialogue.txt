Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I previously suggested, here's a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # Assuming 4 is moderate pain
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # Assuming 3 is slight
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 60
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 2  # Assuming 2 is missing/none
    nodes[4] = X["capillary_refill_time"] <= 1  # 1 is less than 3 seconds
    nodes[5] = X["peristalsis"] <= 3  # 3 is hypomotile
    nodes[6] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree is based on the most important features that are likely to determine whether a case is surgical or not. The thresholds used in the nodes are based on the feature encodings provided and common medical knowledge. However, these thresholds might need to be
