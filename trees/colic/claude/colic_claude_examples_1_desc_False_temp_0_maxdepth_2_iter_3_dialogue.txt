Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that focuses on pain, abdominal_distension, and packed_cell_volume as the main predictors. I'll adjust the thresholds based on the feature encodings provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: pain <= 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    # Values > 4 indicate severe pain (5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # Second split for less severe pain cases: abdominal_distension >= 3 (severe)
    # Values: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Less severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe or slight distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
        else:  # No or moderate distension
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
    else:  # Severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the pain level is less severe (≤ 4, which includes alert, intermittent mild pain, and depressed)
2. For cases with less severe pain, it then checks the abdominal distension
3. Predicts surgery (1) if:
   - Pain is severe (> 4), or
   - Pain is less severe but there's severe or slight abdominal distension
4. Predicts no surgery (0) if:
   - Pain is less severe and abdominal distension is none or moderate

I've simplified the tree to use just two features while maintaining clinical relevance. The thresholds are based on the provided feature encodings, where pain values > 4 indicate severe pain, and abdominal_distension ≥ 3 indicates severe or slight distension.
