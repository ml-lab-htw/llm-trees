Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the decision tree implemented as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First level: Check abdominal distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
    # Split between moderate/less vs severe
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second level: Check pain (1-5 scale)
        # Consider mild pain as 1 or 4 (alert or intermittent mild pain)
        nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            # Third level: Check pulse
            nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        # Other branch for severe distension
        # Fourth level: Check packed cell volume
        nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
        if nodes[3]:
            # Fifth level: Check capillary refill time
            nodes[4] = X["capillary_refill_time"] <= 1  # 1 = less than 3 seconds
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Considers the actual encodings of the features
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
4. Uses clinically meaningful thresholds
5. Has a maximum depth of 5
6. Takes into account the most important clinical indicators for surgical decisions in horse colic cases

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Abdominal distension: splits between moderate/
