Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Node conditions using the exact feature names and reasonable thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # <= 0/'moderate'
    nodes[1] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    nodes[2] = X["pain"] <= 4  # <= 'intermittent mild pain'
    nodes[3] = X["peripheral_pulse"] <= 3  # <= 'normal'
    
    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension <= 2
        if nodes[1]:  # packed_cell_volume <= 45
            if nodes[2]:  # pain <= 4
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:  # abdominal_distension > 2
        if nodes[3]:  # peripheral_pulse <= 3
            prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of node conditions
3. Evaluates the conditions using the exact feature names provided
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are set based on the provided feature descriptions and medical knowledge:
- abdominal_distension threshold of 2 separates none/moderate from severe
- packed_cell_volume threshold of 45% is a clinically relevant cutoff
- pain threshold of 4 separates mild from severe pain
- peripheral_pulse threshold of 3 separates normal from reduced/absent
