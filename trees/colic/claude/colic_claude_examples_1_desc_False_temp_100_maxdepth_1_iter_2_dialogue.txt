Based on the provided feature encodings and the decision tree I proposed earlier using abdominal_distension as the main feature, here's the corresponding Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # only one decision node since depth=1
    
    # abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
    # We consider severe (3) as requiring surgery, while moderate (1), none (2), and slight (4) as non-surgical
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if severe distension
        prediction = 1  # surgical case
    else:  # if moderate, none, or slight distension
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical case
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list for storing the node conditions
3. Checks if abdominal_distension equals 3 (severe)
4. Returns 1 (surgery needed) if distension is severe, 0 (no surgery needed) otherwise
5. Also returns the list of node conditions

The prediction follows the mapping:
- 0 = no surgery needed
- 1 = surgery needed

And it uses the provided encoding for abdominal_distension:
- 1 = moderate
- 2 = none
- 3 = severe
- 4 = slight
