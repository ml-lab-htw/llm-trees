Based on the provided decision tree and the feature descriptions, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesion surgery prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Root node
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # 1 (moderate) or 2 (none)
    
    # Node 1: Left child of root
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # 1 (alert) or 2 (continuous severe pain) or 3 (depressed)
    
    # Node 2: Right child of root
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 2  # 0 (more than 1 liter) or 1 (less than 1 liter) or 2 (missing)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names and the values are the corresponding feature values.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The root node (nodes[0]) checks if the abdominal distension is moderate or none (≤ 2). 

4. If abdominal distension is moderate or none (nodes[0] is True):
   - We check the degree of pain (nodes[1]). If it's alert, continuous severe pain, or depressed (≤ 3), we predict Not Surgical (0). Otherwise, we predict Surgical (1).

5. If abdominal distension is severe (nodes[0] is False):
   - We check the nasogastric reflux (nodes[
