Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert pain levels to binary (severe/not severe)
    # Continuous severe pain (2) and intermittent severe pain (5) are considered severe
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Is pain severe?
    
    # Abdominal distension: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Is distension moderate or severe?
    
    # Normal pulse range is typically 28-44 bpm in horses
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80  # Is pulse elevated?
    
    # Normal PCV range is typically 32-48%
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45  # Is PCV elevated?

    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[3]:  # High PCV
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # Normal/Low PCV
            if X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0:  # >= 3 seconds
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # Non-severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Moderate/Severe distension
            if nodes[2]:  # High pulse
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided
2. Considers clinically relevant thresholds
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of boolean values for each decision
