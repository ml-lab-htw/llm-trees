Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function using abdominal_distension as the key feature, where severe distension (value 3) would indicate surgical cases:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one decision node since depth=1
    
    # Check if abdominal distension is severe (3)
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical case
    else:
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical case
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list with one node (since we have a depth-1 tree)
3. Checks if abdominal_distension equals 3 (severe)
4. Returns 1 (surgery needed) if distension is severe, 0 (no surgery needed) otherwise
5. Also returns the list of node conditions (True/False)

The decision is based on the encoded values where abdominal_distension has these values:
1 = moderate
2 = none
3 = severe
4 = slight
