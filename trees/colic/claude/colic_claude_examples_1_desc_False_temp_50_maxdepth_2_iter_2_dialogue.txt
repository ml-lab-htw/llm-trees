Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic case requires surgery (1) or not (0), using pain and abdominal_distension as the main features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Pain threshold: considering values 2 (continuous severe pain) and 5 (intermittent severe pain) as severe pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] not in [2, 5]  # True if pain is not severe
    
    # Abdominal distension threshold: 1 (moderate) and 3 (severe) indicate significant distension
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [2, 4]  # True if distension is none or slight
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If pain is not severe
        if nodes[1]:  # If distension is none or slight
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:  # If distension is moderate or severe
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:  # If pain is severe
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. First checks if the pain level is not severe (not continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain)
2. Then checks if abdominal distension is minimal (none or slight)
3. Predicts surgical case (1) if:
   - Pain is severe (nodes[0] is False)
   - OR if pain is not severe but distension is significant (nodes[0] is True and nodes[1] is False)
4. Predicts non-surgical case (0) if:
   - Pain is not severe AND distension is minimal

The nodes list contains the boolean values for each decision node:
- nodes[0]: True if pain is not severe
- nodes[1]: True if abdominal distension is none or slight
