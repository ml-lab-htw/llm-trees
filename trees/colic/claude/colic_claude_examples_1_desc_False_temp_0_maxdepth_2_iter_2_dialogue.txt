Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that focuses on pain, abdominal_distension, and packed_cell_volume as the main predictors. I'll adjust the thresholds according to the feature encodings provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: pain <= 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    # Values 1 (alert) and 4 (intermittent mild pain) are considered less severe
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # Second split for less severe pain: abdominal_distension >= 3 (severe)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Less severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # Less severe distension
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # More severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree considers:
1. First, it checks if the pain level is less severe (alert or intermittent mild pain, encoded as 1 or 4)
2. For cases with less severe pain, it then checks the abdominal distension level
3. Cases with severe pain (continuous severe pain, depressed, or intermittent severe pain) are classified as surgical
4. For less severe pain cases, the decision depends on the abdominal distension level

I've simplified the original tree to focus on the two most critical features (pain and abdominal_distension) based on the provided encodings. This version should be more robust given the actual feature encodings in the dataset.

The function returns both the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node in the tree.
