Based on the provided feature encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (1) or not (0). Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with appropriate thresholds based on feature encodings
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # pain level threshold (mild to moderate)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # slight or less
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # normal pulse threshold
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 2  # none or missing
    nodes[4] = X["peristalsis"] <= 3  # hypomotile or less
    nodes[5] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45  # normal PCV threshold
    nodes[6] = X["total_protein"] <= 6.5  # normal protein threshold
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain levels
        if nodes[1]:  # Minimal abdominal distension
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Normal pulse
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:  # Higher pain levels
        if nodes[3]:  # Limited nasogastric reflux
            if nodes[4]:  # Reduced peristalsis
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[5]:  # Normal PCV
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                if nodes[6]:  # Lower total protein
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list of 7 boolean conditions based on
