Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, I'll create a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # moderate or less
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # mild or less
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # none
    nodes[4] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1  # less than 3 seconds
    nodes[5] = X["peristalsis"] <= 3  # hypomotile or less
    nodes[6] = X["rectal_temperature"] <= 38.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the specific feature keys provided and takes into account the feature encodings. For example, "abdominal_distension" uses the encoding where 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight. The threshold "moderate or less" is represented by
