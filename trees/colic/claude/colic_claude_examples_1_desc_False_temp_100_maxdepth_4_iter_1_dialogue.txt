Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing binary decisions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes using the actual feature encodings
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # moderate or less (1 = moderate, 2 = none)
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4  # mild pain or less (4 = intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # pulse threshold for tachycardia
    nodes[3] = X["peripheral_pulse"] <= 2  # reduced or absent pulse (1 = absent, 2 = increased)

    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal distension <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= mild
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # pain > mild
            if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:  # pulse > 80
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # abdominal distension > moderate
        if nodes[3]:  # peripheral pulse <= reduced
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # peripheral pulse > reduced
            if X["capillary_refill_time"] <= 1:  # less than 3 seconds
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:  # more than 3 seconds
                prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the binary decisions at each node
3. Evaluates the conditions using the actual feature encodings provided
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node decisions
5. Uses realistic thresholds based on the feature descriptions and medical knowledge

The thresholds are set according to the provided feature encodings and typical clinical values:
