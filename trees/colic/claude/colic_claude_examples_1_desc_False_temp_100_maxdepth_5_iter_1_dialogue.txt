Based on the provided feature descriptions and their encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the horse colic surgery classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with actual thresholds based on the provided encodings
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # none or slight
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4  # mild pain or less
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    nodes[3] = X["pulse"] <= 80
    nodes[4] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 2  # missing or less
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension <= 2
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= 4
            if nodes[2]:  # packed_cell_volume <= 45
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:  # pain > 4
            if nodes[3]:  # pulse <= 80
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:  # abdominal_distension > 2
        if nodes[4]:  # nasogastric_reflux <= 2
            prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Incorporates the correct encodings for categorical variables
3. Uses reasonable thresholds for numerical variables
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of boolean values for each decision node
5. Has a maximum depth of 5
6. Uses clinically relevant decision points

The thresholds are chosen based on medical knowledge:
- Abdominal distension threshold differentiates between mild and severe cases
- Pain level threshold separates mild from severe pain
- Packed cell volume of 45% is a clinically relevant
