Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature keys and encodings, here's the Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[0] = X['abdominal_distension'] <= 3  # 3 or less means moderate or less
    
    # Left child: Degree of Pain
    nodes[1] = X['pain'] <= 3  # 3 or less means mild pain or less
    
    # Right child: Nasogastric Reflux
    nodes[2] = X['nasogastric_reflux'] <= 2  # 2 or less means some reflux (including missing data)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the thresholds:

1. For 'abdominal_distension', we use <= 3 because 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight. We want to separate severe (3) from the rest.

2. For 'pain', we use <= 3 because 1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain. We consider 3 (depressed) or less as mild pain or less.

3. For 'nasogastric_reflux', we use <= 2 because 0 = more than 1 liter, 1 = less than 1 liter, 2 = missing, 3 = none. We consider any reflux (including missing data) as significant.

This function will return a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical
