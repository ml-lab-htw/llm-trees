Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (1) or not (0), using abdominal_distension, pain, and packed_cell_volume as the main features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split: abdominal_distension <= 1 (moderate)
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 1
    
    # Second split left: pain <= 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # Second split right: packed_cell_volume threshold
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension <= 1 (moderate)
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= 4 (intermittent mild pain)
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:  # abdominal_distension > 1
        if nodes[2]:  # packed_cell_volume <= 45
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgery
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. abdominal_distension as the first split (1 = moderate)
2. pain as the second split for the left branch (4 = intermittent mild pain)
3. packed_cell_volume as the second split for the right branch (threshold at 45%)

The thresholds were chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Moderate or worse abdominal distension (≤ 1) is a significant indicator
- Intermittent mild pain or less (≤ 4) suggests less severe cases
- Packed cell volume > 45% can indicate dehydration, which might require surgical intervention

The function returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node.
