Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the horse colic surgery classification task:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check pain level (severe pain = 2 or 5)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # severe pain (continuous or intermittent)
    
    # Node 1: Check abdominal distension (moderate or severe = 1 or 3)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]
    
    # Node 2: Check peristalsis (absent or hypomotile = 1 or 3)
    nodes[2] = X["peristalsis"] in [1, 3]
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if severe pain
        if X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0:  # more than 3 seconds
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # absent or hypomotile peristalsis
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # if not severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # moderate or severe distension
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Pain level as the primary decision point (severe pain suggests surgical cases)
2. Capillary refill time as a key indicator of cardiovascular status
3. Peristalsis to assess gut motility
4. Abdominal distension as an important physical sign

The function returns:
- prediction: 1 for surgical cases, 0 for non-surgical cases
- nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node

The thresholds and conditions are based on the provided feature encodings and clinical relevance for surgical decision-making in horse colic cases.
