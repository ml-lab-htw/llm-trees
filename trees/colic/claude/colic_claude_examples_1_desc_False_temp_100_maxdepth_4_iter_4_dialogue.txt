Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that uses meaningful thresholds and returns both the prediction and node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for 4 inner nodes
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # Split between mild (depressed/alert) and severe pain
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # Split on slight or less distension
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45  # Critical PCV threshold
    nodes[3] = X["capillary_refill_time"] <= 1  # Split on less than 3 seconds
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain levels
        if nodes[1]:  # Slight or less distension
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # PCV <= 45
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery
    else:  # Higher pain levels
        if X["abdominal_distension"] <= 1:  # Moderate distension
            if nodes[3]:  # Normal capillary refill
                prediction = 0  # No surgery
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgery
        else:  # Severe distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the nodes list
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature encodings provided
- Follows the same structure as the previously described tree but with proper variable names and encodings
- Has a maximum depth of 4
- Makes decisions based on clinically relevant thresholds for pain, abdominal distension, packed cell volume, and capillary refill time

The thresholds are chosen based on the provided encoding schemes:
- pain <= 3 separates mild from severe pain cases
- abdominal_distension <=
