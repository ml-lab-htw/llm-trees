Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses abdominal_distension, pain, and pulse as the key features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
    # Converting to meaningful threshold where <= 2 means moderate or less severe
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2
    
    # pain: 1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 
    #       4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
    # Converting to meaningful threshold where <= 4 means mild pain or less
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # pulse: beats per minute
    # Using 80 as a clinically relevant threshold
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80

    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= mild
            prediction = 0  # no surgery needed
        else:  # pain > mild
            prediction = 1  # surgery needed
    else:  # abdominal_distension > moderate
        if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
            prediction = 0  # no surgery needed
        else:  # pulse > 80
            prediction = 1  # surgery needed
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Evaluates three conditions:
   - Whether abdominal distension is moderate or less
   - Whether pain is mild or less
   - Whether pulse is 80 bpm or less
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Abdominal distension threshold of 2 separates none/moderate from severe cases
- Pain threshold of
