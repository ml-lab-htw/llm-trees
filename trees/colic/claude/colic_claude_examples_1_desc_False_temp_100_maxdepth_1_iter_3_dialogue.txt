Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree using abdominal_distension as the splitting feature. Since there's only one split (depth=1), we only need one node.

According to the encoding, abdominal_distension is coded as:
1 = moderate
2 = none
3 = severe
4 = slight

The decision tree should classify cases with severe distension (3) as surgical and others as non-surgical.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    # Check if abdominal distension is severe (3)
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X containing the features
- Creates a list 'nodes' with one element (as we only have one split)
- Checks if abdominal_distension equals 3 (severe)
- Returns 1 (surgical) if distension is severe, 0 (non-surgical) otherwise
- Returns both the prediction and the nodes list

The nodes list will contain True (1) if the distension is severe, and False (0) otherwise.
