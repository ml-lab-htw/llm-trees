Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the horse colic surgery classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define conditions for each node using provided feature encodings
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # moderate or less (1=moderate, 2=none)
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4  # mild pain or less (4=intermittent mild pain)
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= mild
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:  # pain > mild
            if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:  # pulse > 80
                prediction = 1  # surgery needed
    else:  # abdominal_distension > moderate (severe)
        if nodes[3]:  # packed_cell_volume <= 45
            if X["peripheral_pulse"] == 3:  # normal
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
            else:  # reduced or absent (1 or 4)
                prediction = 1  # surgery needed
        else:  # packed_cell_volume > 45
            prediction = 1  # surgery needed
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names provided
- Follows the encoding scheme given in the feature descriptions
- Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions
- Uses clinically relevant threshold values
- Has a maximum depth of 4
- Incorporates key clinical indicators for colic severity

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Abdominal distension: uses the provided encoding (1=moderate, 2=none)
- Pain: uses the provided encoding (4=intermittent
