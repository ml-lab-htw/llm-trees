Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature descriptions, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesion surgical prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # 3 is the threshold between moderate and severe
    
    # Left child: Degree of Pain
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # 3 is the threshold between mild and severe pain
    
    # Right child: Nasogastric Reflux
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 2  # 2 is the threshold for "none"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the thresholds:

1. For "abdominal_distension", the values are encoded as follows:
   1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
   We use <= 3 to separate moderate or less (1, 2, 4) from severe (3).

2. For "pain", the values are encoded as follows:
   1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
   We use <= 3 to separate mild pain or less (1, 3, 4) from severe pain (2, 5).

3. For "nasogastric_reflux", the values are encoded as follows:
   0 = more than 1 liter, 1 = less than 1 liter, 2 = missing, 3 = none
   We use <= 2 to separate "none" (3)
