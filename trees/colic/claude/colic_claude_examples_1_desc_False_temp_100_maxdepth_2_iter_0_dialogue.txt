Based on the provided feature descriptions and encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the horse colic surgical decision tree using abdominal_distension and pain as the key features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: checking if abdominal distension is less than or equal to moderate
    # abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] != 3  # True if not severe
    
    # Second node: checking pain level
    # pain: 1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 
    #       4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # True if pain is mild (alert, depressed) 
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if distension is not severe
        if nodes[1]:  # if pain is mild
            prediction = 0  # no surgery needed
        else:  # if pain is severe
            prediction = 1  # surgery needed
    else:  # if distension is severe
        prediction = 1  # surgery needed
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree where:
1. It first checks if abdominal distension is not severe (anything except 3)
2. If distension is not severe, it then checks the pain level
3. Surgery is recommended (prediction = 1) if:
   - Abdominal distension is severe (value 3) OR
   - Pain is severe (values 4 or 5: intermittent mild/severe pain)
4. No surgery (prediction = 0) is recommended only if distension is not severe AND pain is mild

The nodes list contains boolean values indicating whether each condition was met, following the structure requested in the example.
