Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, I'll create a decision tree prediction function. I'll use the same structure as my previous tree but adapt it to the exact feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on pain (values 1-5)
    # Consider severe pain (2: continuous severe pain, 5: intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] not in [2, 5]
    
    # Second split depends on first condition
    if nodes[0]:
        # For less severe pain, check abdominal distension
        # (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
        # Consider "slight" (4) or "none" (2) as mild
        nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [2, 4]
    else:
        # For severe pain, check packed cell volume
        nodes[1] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    # Make prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Less severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Mild distension
            prediction = 0  # No surgery
        else:  # Moderate/severe distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgery
    else:  # Severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgery regardless of PCV
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names from the provided list
2. Accounts for the categorical encoding of pain (1-5) and abdominal_distension (1-4)
3. Uses a meaningful threshold for packed_cell_volume (45%)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions
5. Maintains the same logical structure as the previous tree but adapts it to the specific feature encodings

The tree primarily considers:
- Pain level (distinguishing severe from non-severe pain)
- Abdominal distension (for cases with less severe pain)
- Packed cell volume (for cases with severe pain)
