Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # 3 is the threshold for 'moderate'
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # 3 is the threshold for 'mild'
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 3  # 3 means 'none'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the thresholds:

1. For `abdominal_distension`, the values are encoded as follows:
   1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
   We want to split between moderate and severe, so we use 3 as the threshold.

2. For `pain`, the values are encoded as:
   1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
   We consider 3 (depressed) as the threshold for mild pain.

3. For `nasogastric_reflux`, the values are encoded as:
   0 = more than 1 liter, 1 = less than 1 liter, 2 = missing, 3 = none
   We use 3 as the threshold to distinguish between any reflux and no reflux.

This function will return a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for not surgical, 1 for surgical)
2. A list of three boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Note that this decision tree is a simplified model and in real-world scenarios, veterinary
