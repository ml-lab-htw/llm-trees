Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (1) or not (0):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Node conditions using the exact feature names and proper encodings
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # severe distension
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] >= 4  # intermittent mild pain or worse
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # more than 3 seconds
    nodes[3] = X["peristalsis"] == 1  # absent
    nodes[4] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0  # more than 1 liter
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension < 3
        if not nodes[1]:  # pain < 4
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:  # pain >= 4
            if nodes[2]:  # capillary_refill_time > 3 seconds
                prediction = 1  # surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
    else:  # abdominal_distension >= 3
        if nodes[3]:  # peristalsis absent
            prediction = 1  # surgery
        else:  # peristalsis not absent
            if nodes[4]:  # nasogastric_reflux > 1 liter
                prediction = 1  # surgery
            else:
                prediction = 0  # no surgery
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Evaluates 5 key clinical indicators using their proper encodings
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
4. Uses the exact feature names as provided
5. Incorporates the correct encodings for categorical variables
6. Makes logical
