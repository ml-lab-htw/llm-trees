Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the additional information you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesion surgery prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # 2 represents "moderate" distension
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] <= 80
    nodes[2] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1  # 1 represents "less than 3 seconds"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (as we have 3 decision nodes in our tree) to store the boolean results of each condition.

3. The first node checks if abdominal distension is less than or equal to "moderate" (encoded as 2 in the given feature description).

4. The second node checks if the pulse is less than or equal to 80 beats per minute.

5. The third node checks if the capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds (encoded as 1 in the given feature description).

6. The tree then makes decisions based on these conditions:
   - If abdominal distension is moderate or less (nodes[0] is True):
     - If pulse is 80 or less, predict non-surgical (0)
     - If pulse is greater than 80, predict surgical (1)
   - If abdominal distension is severe (nodes[0] is False):
     - Predict surgical (1) regardless of capillary refill time

7. The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and the
