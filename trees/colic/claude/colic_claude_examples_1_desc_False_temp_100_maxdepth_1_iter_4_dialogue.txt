Based on the provided feature encodings and the decision tree I suggested earlier using pain as the primary feature, I'll create a prediction function. I'll adapt the pain threshold considering that severe pain is represented by values 2 (continuous severe pain) and 5 (intermittent severe pain) in the encoding.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # only one decision node for depth=1
    
    # Check if pain indicates severe pain (continuous or intermittent)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # True if severe pain (continuous or intermittent)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical case
    else:
        prediction = 0  # non-surgical case
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list for storing the node decisions
3. Evaluates if the pain level indicates severe pain (either continuous severe pain=2 or intermittent severe pain=5)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for surgical cases, 0 for non-surgical cases
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The logic is:
- If pain is severe (continuous or intermittent) → surgical case (1)
- If pain is mild or absent (other values) → non-surgical case (0)
