Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature descriptions, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Degree of Pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # 3 represents "depressed" which is less severe than continuous or intermittent severe pain
    
    # Second level nodes
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # 3 represents "severe", so this checks if it's "slight" or less
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the changes and decisions made:

1. The root node uses the "pain" feature. Values 1-3 (alert, continuous severe pain, depressed) are considered less severe than 4-5 (intermittent mild pain, intermittent severe pain). This aligns with our original decision of "Degree of Pain <= moderate".

2. For the second level, we use "abdominal_distension". Values 1-3 (moderate, none, severe) are considered as "slight" or less, while 4 (slight) is actually the highest level of distension in this encoding.

3. For the third node, we use "packed_cell_volume" with the threshold of 45%, as in our original tree.

4. The prediction values are adjusted to match the target variable encoding (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).

This function will return a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for no surgery, 1 for surgery)
2. A list of three boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Note that this tree structure results in all cases with severe pain (pain > 3) being classifie
