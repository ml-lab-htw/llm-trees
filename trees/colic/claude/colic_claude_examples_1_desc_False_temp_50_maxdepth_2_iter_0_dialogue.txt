Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) using the pain level and abdominal distension as the main decision factors.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if pain is severe (values 2 or 5 indicate severe pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # severe pain conditions
    
    # Second node: Check abdominal distension (1 = moderate, 3 = severe)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # moderate or severe distension
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If severe pain
        prediction = 1  # Surgical case
    else:  # If not severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # If significant distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgical case
        else:  # If no significant distension
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical case
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the pain level indicates severe pain (continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain)
2. For cases without severe pain, it checks if there's significant abdominal distension (moderate or severe)
3. Recommends surgery (1) if either:
   - The horse has severe pain
   - The horse has significant abdominal distension
4. Recommends no surgery (0) if neither condition is met

The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the condition results at each node in the tree.

This implementation takes into account the actual encodings provided in the feature descriptions, where:
- pain: 2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
- abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 3 = severe
