Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, here's the decision tree function for the horse colic surgery prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with appropriate thresholds based on feature encodings
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # pain level threshold (mild to moderate)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # slight or less
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # normal pulse range
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45  # normal PCV range
    nodes[4] = X["peristalsis"] <= 3  # hypomotile or less
    nodes[5] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # >= 3 seconds
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # pain <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # abdominal_distension <= slight
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # pain > moderate
        if nodes[3]:  # packed_cell_volume <= 45
            if nodes[4]:  # peristalsis <= hypomotile
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # packed_cell_volume > 45
            if nodes[5]:  # capillary_refill_time >= 3 seconds
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names from the provided list
2. Considers the feature encodings provided
3. Returns predictions as binary (0 = no surgery,
