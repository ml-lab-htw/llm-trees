Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (1) or not (0), using the most relevant clinical features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Convert conditions to binary decisions based on provided encodings
    # abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight
    # pain: 1 = alert, 4 = intermittent mild pain
    # nasogastric_reflux: 0 = more than 1 liter, 1 = less than 1 liter, 3 = none
    
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # Check if distension is none or moderate
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # Check if pain is mild (alert or depressed)
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # Check if nasogastric reflux is none
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Distension is none or moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # Pain is mild
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:  # Pain is severe
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:  # Distension is severe
        if nodes[2]:  # No nasogastric reflux
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
        else:  # Present nasogastric reflux
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Incorporates the correct encoding of features as specified
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node decisions
4. Uses clinically meaningful thresholds based on the provided feature encodings
5. Follows the same tree structure as previously discussed but with precise encodings

The decision points are based on:
- Abdominal distension severity
- Pain level
- Presence of nasogastric reflux
