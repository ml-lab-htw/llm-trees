Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the decision tree function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion requires surgery (1) or not (0):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Pain: 2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # severe pain
    
    # Abdominal distension: 2 = none, 4 = slight
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] not in [2, 4]  # moderate or severe
    
    # Nasogastric reflux: 3 = none
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] != 3  # presence of reflux
    
    # Packed cell volume threshold based on typical clinical values
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # severe pain
        if nodes[2]:  # presence of reflux
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # no reflux
            if nodes[3]:  # high packed cell volume
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # no severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # significant distension
            if X["pulse"] > 80:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks for severe pain (continuous or intermittent)
2. Evaluates abdominal distension
3. Checks for the presence of nasogastric reflux
4. Considers packed cell volume
5. Uses pulse rate as an additional criterion in some branches

The function returns both the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each internal node of the tree.

The thresholds used are based on typical clinical values
