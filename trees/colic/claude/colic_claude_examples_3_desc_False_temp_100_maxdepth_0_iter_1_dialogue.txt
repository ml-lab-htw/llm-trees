Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I proposed earlier, here's a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # Assuming 3 represents moderate pain
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 4  # 4 represents slight distension
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] <= 2  # 2 represents missing, so we're checking for none
    nodes[3] = X["pulse"] <= 80
    nodes[4] = X["capillary_refill_time"] <= 1  # 1 represents less than 3 seconds
    nodes[5] = X["peristalsis"] <= 3  # 3 represents hypomotile

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            if nodes[1]:
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for "Not Surgical" and 1 for "Surgical"
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the following features:
- pain
- abdominal_distension
- nasogastric_reflux
- pulse
- capillary_refill_time
- peristalsis

The thresholds are set based on the provided feature encodings and some assumptions about
