Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the most relevant features for predicting whether surgery is needed (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Convert pain levels to binary decision: severe (2,5) vs non-severe (1,3,4)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # severe pain (continuous or intermittent)
    
    # Abdominal distension: severe/moderate (1,3) vs slight/none (2,4)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]
    
    # Critical pulse threshold
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80
    
    # Capillary refill time: more than 3 seconds is concerning
    nodes[3] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 0  # 0 means >3 seconds
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[3]:  # Poor capillary refill
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Normal capillary refill
            if nodes[1]:  # Severe/moderate distension
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # Non-severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe/moderate distension
            if nodes[2]:  # High pulse
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree considers:
1. Pain level as the primary split (severe vs non-severe)
2. Capillary refill time as a critical indicator
3. Abdominal distension severity
4. Pulse rate as a vital sign

The function returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node in the tree.
