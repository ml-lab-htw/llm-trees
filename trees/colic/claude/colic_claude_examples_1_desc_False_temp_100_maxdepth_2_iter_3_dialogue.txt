Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the horse colic surgery decision tree using the most clinically relevant features and their actual value ranges:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node checks abdominal distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
    # We consider severe distension (3) as the critical threshold
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] < 3
    
    # Second node checks pain level (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 
    # 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    # We consider continuous severe pain (2) as the critical threshold
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] < 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Less than severe distension
        if nodes[1]:  # Less severe pain
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
        else:  # More severe pain
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
    else:  # Severe distension
        if X["pulse"] <= 80:  # Check pulse as third decision point
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the decision nodes
3. Uses abdominal_distension and pain as the main decision features, with pulse as a third criterion
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the nodes list
5. Uses the actual encodings provided in the feature descriptions
6. Makes clinically sensible threshold choices based on the given encodings

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Severe distension (3) is a critical indicator
- Continuous severe pain (2) indicates potential surgical need
- Pulse rate of 80 bpm is a clinically relevant threshold for horses
