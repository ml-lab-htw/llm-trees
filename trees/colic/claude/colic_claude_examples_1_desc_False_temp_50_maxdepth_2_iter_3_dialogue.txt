Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function focusing on pain and abdominal_distension as key predictors. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: checking if pain is less severe
    # pain <= 4 means alert, depressed, or intermittent mild pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # Second node: checking abdominal distension
    # abdominal_distension > 2 means none or slight distension
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] > 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # pain is less severe
        if nodes[1]:  # minimal distension
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # significant distension
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # severe pain
        prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses the following logic:
1. First split is on pain level (node 0):
   - pain <= 4 includes alert (1), depressed (3), and intermittent mild pain (4)
   - pain > 4 includes continuous severe pain (2) and intermittent severe pain (5)

2. Second split is on abdominal_distension (node 1):
   - abdominal_distension > 2 means none (2) or slight (4)
   - abdominal_distension <= 2 means moderate (1) or severe (3)

The function returns:
- prediction: 0 for non-surgical cases, 1 for surgical cases
- nodes: a list of boolean values indicating which conditions were met at each node

This implementation takes into account the actual feature encodings provided in the description and aims to create meaningful thresholds based on the clinical severity of symptoms.
