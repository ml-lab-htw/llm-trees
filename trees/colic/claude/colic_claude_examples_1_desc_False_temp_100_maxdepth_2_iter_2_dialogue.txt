Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, here's the prediction function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: abdominal_distension (1=moderate, 2=none, 3=severe, 4=slight)
    # Check if distension is moderate or less (≤ moderate)
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 2, 4]  # moderate, none, or slight
    
    # Second splits:
    # For left branch: pain (1=alert, 2=continuous severe, 3=depressed, 4=intermittent mild, 5=intermittent severe)
    # For right branch: nasogastric_reflux (0=more than 1L, 1=less than 1L, 2=missing, 3=none)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["pain"] in [1, 4]  # alert or intermittent mild pain
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # none
    
    # Make prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery)
    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal distension ≤ moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # mild pain or alert
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:  # severe or continuous pain
            prediction = 1  # surgery
    else:  # severe abdominal distension
        if nodes[1]:  # no reflux
            prediction = 0  # no surgery
        else:  # has reflux
            prediction = 1  # surgery
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Considers the specific encodings for each feature
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions
4. Makes logical clinical sense based on the feature values and their meanings
5. Follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier

The node conditions are:
