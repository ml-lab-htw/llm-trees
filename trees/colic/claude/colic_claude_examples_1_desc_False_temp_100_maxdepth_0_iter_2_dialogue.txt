Based on the provided feature encodings and medical context, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the most relevant features and appropriate thresholds for predicting whether a horse colic case requires surgery (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check pain level (severe pain conditions: 2 or 5)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain
    
    # Node 1: Check abdominal distension (3 = severe, 1 = moderate)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # moderate or severe
    
    # Node 2: Check pulse (critical threshold for horses)
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80
    
    # Node 3: Check packed cell volume (indicator of dehydration)
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Moderate/severe distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # High packed cell volume
                prediction = 1  # Surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # Mild/moderate pain
        if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:  # Distension and high pulse
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks for severe pain (node 0)
2. Evaluates abdominal distension (node 1)
3. Considers pulse rate (node 2)
4. Looks at packed cell volume (node 3)

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance:
- Pain levels 2 and 5 represent severe pain conditions
- Abdominal distension levels 1 and 3 represent moderate to severe distension
- Pulse
