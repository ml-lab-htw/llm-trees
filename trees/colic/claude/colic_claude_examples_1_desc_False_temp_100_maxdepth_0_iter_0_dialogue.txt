Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Pain: values 2 (continuous severe) and 5 (intermittent severe) indicate severe pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
    
    # Abdominal distension: 1 = moderate, 3 = severe
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]
    
    # Packed cell volume: critical threshold at 45%
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
    
    # Peristalsis: 1 = absent
    nodes[3] = X["peristalsis"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[3]:  # Absent peristalsis
            prediction = 1
        else:
            if X["nasogastric_reflux"] in [0, 1]:  # More than 1L or less than 1L
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:  # Not severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Moderate/severe distension
            if nodes[2]:  # High packed cell volume
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 0
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree considers:
1. Severe pain (continuous or intermittent)
2. Significant abdominal distension (moderate or severe)
3. High packed cell volume (> 45%)
4. Absent peristalsis
5. Presence of nasogastric reflux

The function returns:
- prediction: 0 for non-surgical cases, 1 for surgical cases
- nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node

The thresholds and conditions are based on clinical relevance according to the provided feature encodings and typical medical decision-making in horse colic cases.
