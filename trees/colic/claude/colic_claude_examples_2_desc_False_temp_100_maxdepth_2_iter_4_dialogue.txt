Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesion surgical prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # 3 or less means moderate or less
    
    # Left child: Degree of Pain
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # 3 or less includes alert, depressed, and intermittent mild pain
    
    # Right child: Nasogastric Reflux
    nodes[2] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # 3 means none
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the thresholds:

1. For "abdominal_distension", we use <= 3 because 1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight. We want to separate moderate or less (1, 2, 4) from severe (3).

2. For "pain", we use <= 3 because 1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain. We're separating mild pain or less (1, 3, 4) from more severe pain (2, 5).

3. For "nasogastric_reflux", we use == 3 because 3 means none, which is what we're checking for in the original tree.

This function will return a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical)
2. A list of three boolean values representing the truth values
