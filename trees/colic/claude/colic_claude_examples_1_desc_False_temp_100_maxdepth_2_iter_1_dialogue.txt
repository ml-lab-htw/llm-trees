Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses pain and abdominal_distension as the main predictors for surgical cases. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Pain: 2 (continuous severe pain) or 5 (intermittent severe pain) indicate severe pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]  # Checking for severe pain types
    
    # Abdominal distension: 1 (moderate) or 3 (severe) indicate significant distension
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]  # Checking for moderate/severe distension
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # If significant distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
    else:  # If not severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # If significant distension
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the pain is severe (continuous or intermittent)
2. Then checks if there's significant abdominal distension (moderate or severe)
3. Returns 1 (surgery needed) if either:
   - There's severe pain AND significant distension
   - There's significant distension even without severe pain
4. Returns 0 (no surgery needed) otherwise

The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of boolean values representing the state of each decision node.
