Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that makes clinically sensible decisions. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Node conditions using the exact feature names and appropriate thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # Check if distension is none or slight
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4  # Check if pain is mild (intermittent mild pain or less)
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # Check if pulse is within normal range
    nodes[3] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1  # Check if capillary refill time is less than 3 seconds
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If distension is mild or none
        if nodes[1]:  # If pain is mild or less
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
        else:  # More severe pain
            if nodes[2]:  # Normal pulse
                prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
            else:  # Elevated pulse
                prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
    else:  # More severe distension
        if nodes[3]:  # Normal capillary refill
            prediction = 0  # No surgery needed
        else:  # Delayed capillary refill
            prediction = 1  # Surgery needed
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names as provided
2. Uses clinically relevant thresholds
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions
4. Makes decisions based on important clinical indicators: abdominal distension, pain level, pulse rate, and capillary refill time
5. Uses the correct encodings for categorical variables as specified in the feature descriptions
6. Maintains a maximum depth of 3
7. Returns boolean values (True/False) for each node condition

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on clinical relevance:
