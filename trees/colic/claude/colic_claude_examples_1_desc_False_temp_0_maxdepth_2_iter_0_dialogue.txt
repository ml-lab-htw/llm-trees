Based on the provided feature encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses 'pain' and 'abdominal_distension' as the main features. I'll adjust the thresholds based on the feature encodings provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: pain <= 4 (intermittent mild pain)
    # This splits between severe pain (2, 5) and mild pain (1, 3, 4)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4
    
    # Second node: abdominal_distension <= 2 (none)
    # This splits between no/slight distension (2, 4) and moderate/severe distension (1, 3)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # pain is mild/normal
        if nodes[1]:  # no/slight distension
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # moderate/severe distension
            prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # pain is severe
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implements the following logic:
1. If pain is mild (pain <= 4, meaning alert, depressed, or intermittent mild pain) AND there is no or slight abdominal distension (abdominal_distension <= 2), the case is classified as non-surgical (0)
2. If pain is mild BUT there is moderate or severe abdominal distension, the case is classified as surgical (1)
3. If pain is severe (pain > 4, meaning continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain), the case is classified as surgical (1) regardless of other factors

The function returns both the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and a list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each node's condition.
