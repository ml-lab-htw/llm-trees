Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the feature descriptions you've given, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 2  # moderate or less
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 4  # mild or less
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 60
    nodes[3] = X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1  # less than 3 seconds
    nodes[4] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # none
    nodes[5] = X["peristalsis"] <= 3  # hypomotile or less
    nodes[6] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                if X["rectal_temperature"] <= 38.5:
                    prediction = 0  # non-surgical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The function uses the features and encodings as specified in your description. Note that some thresholds have been adjusted to match the provided feature encodings. For example, "abdominal_distension" uses 2 (none
