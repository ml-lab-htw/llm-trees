Based on the given features and target variable for the horse colic lesion classification, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # severe
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 1  # moderate
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45
    nodes[3] = X["pain"] == 2 or X["pain"] == 5  # continuous severe pain or intermittent severe pain

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    elif nodes[1]:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # slight or none abdominal distension
        if nodes[3]:
            if X["peristalsis"] == 1:  # absent
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree based on the most important features we identified earlier. Here's a breakdown of the nodes:

1. `nodes[0]`: Checks if abdominal distension is severe
2. `nodes[1]`: Checks if abdominal distension is moderate
3. `nodes[2]`: Checks if packed cell volume is greater than 45%
4. `nodes[3]`: Checks if the degree of pain is severe (continuous or intermittent)

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction: 1 for surgical, 0 for non-surgical
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Note that this implementation uses the exact keys and encodings provided in the feature description. For example, `abdominal_distension` uses the encoding 1 for moderate, 2 for none, 3 for severe, and
