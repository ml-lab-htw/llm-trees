Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, here's the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Check pain level (severe continuous pain or severe intermittent pain)
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
    
    # Check abdominal distension (severe or moderate)
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 3]
    
    # Check pulse rate (high)
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] > 80
    
    # Check peristalsis (absent)
    nodes[3] = X["peristalsis"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Severe pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Severe/moderate distension
            prediction = 1
        else:  # Slight/no distension
            if nodes[2]:  # High pulse
                prediction = 1
            else:  # Normal pulse
                prediction = 0
    else:  # Mild/no pain
        if nodes[3]:  # Absent peristalsis
            if nodes[1]:  # Severe/moderate distension
                prediction = 1
            else:  # Slight/no distension
                prediction = 0
        else:  # Normal/abnormal peristalsis
            prediction = 0
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the truth values of 4 inner nodes
3. Evaluates conditions based on clinically relevant thresholds
4. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node truth values

The conditions are based on the provided feature encodings:
- pain: 2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain
- abdominal_distension: 1 = moderate, 3 = severe
- pulse: threshold set at 80 bpm (clinically relevant threshold)
- peristalsis: 1 = absent
