Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, here's the decision tree function for the horse colic surgery prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes with proper feature names and thresholds
    # pain: 1=alert, 2=continuous severe pain, 3=depressed, 4=intermittent mild pain, 5=intermittent severe pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 3  # moderate pain threshold
    
    # abdominal_distension: 1=moderate, 2=none, 3=severe, 4=slight
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # slight/moderate threshold
    
    # pulse: beats per minute
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80
    
    # packed_cell_volume: percentage
    nodes[3] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # pain <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # abdominal_distension <= slight/moderate
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # pain > moderate
        if nodes[3]:  # packed_cell_volume <= 45
            if X["capillary_refill_time"] == 1:  # less than 3 seconds
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:
                prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names from the provided list
2. Considers the feature encodings provided
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of boolean values for each decision node
4. Uses meaningful thresholds based on clinical knowledge:
   - Evaluates pain level as primary decision
