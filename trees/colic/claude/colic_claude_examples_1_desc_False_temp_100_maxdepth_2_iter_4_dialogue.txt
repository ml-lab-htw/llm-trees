Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, I'll create a prediction function for the horse colic surgery classification. I'll modify my previous decision tree to use the exact feature names and proper encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check abdominal distension (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
    # Consider severe (3) as critical condition
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] < 3
    
    # Node 1: Check pain level
    # For less severe distension cases, check if pain is severe (2 = continuous severe pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] in [2, 5]
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If distension is not severe
        if nodes[1]:  # If pain is severe
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:  # If pain is not severe
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
    else:  # If distension is severe
        if X["packed_cell_volume"] > 45:  # High PCV indicates dehydration/shock
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary of features as input
2. Creates a list to store the binary results of the decision nodes
3. First checks abdominal distension level
4. Then either checks pain level (for less severe distension) or packed cell volume (for severe distension)
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and the list of node results

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance:
- Severe abdominal distension (value 3) often indicates serious conditions
- Severe pain (values 2 or 5) suggests potential surgical needs
- PCV > 45% indicates significant dehydration, which often occurs in surgical cases
