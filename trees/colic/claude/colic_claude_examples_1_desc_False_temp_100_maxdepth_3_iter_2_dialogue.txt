Based on the provided feature descriptions and encodings, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Check if abdominal distension is moderate or less (1, 2, or 4)
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] in [1, 2, 4]
    
    # Check if pain is mild or less (1 or 4)
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] in [1, 4]
    
    # For right branch: check if nasogastric reflux is significant (0 or 1)
    # For left branch: check if pulse is high
    nodes[2] = (X["pulse"] >= 80) if nodes[0] else (X["nasogastric_reflux"] in [0, 1])

    if nodes[0]:  # abdominal distension <= moderate
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= mild
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # pain > mild
            if nodes[2]:  # pulse >= 80
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:  # pulse < 80
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # abdominal distension > moderate
        if nodes[2]:  # significant reflux
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # no significant reflux
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided
2. Follows the encoding scheme given for each feature
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical) and the list of node conditions
4. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions
5. Maintains the same tree structure as previously described, but now with proper feature encodings

The decision nodes check for:
1. Abdominal distension severity
2. Pain level
3. Either pulse rate or nasogastric reflux depending on the path through the tree
