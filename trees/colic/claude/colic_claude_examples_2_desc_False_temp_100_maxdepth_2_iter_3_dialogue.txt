Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: Degree of Pain
    nodes[0] = X["pain"] <= 4  # 4 represents "intermittent mild pain"
    
    # Left child: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[1] = X["abdominal_distension"] <= 3  # 3 represents "severe"
    
    # Right child: Packed Cell Volume
    nodes[2] = X["packed_cell_volume"] <= 45
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the thresholds:

1. For the "pain" feature, we use 4 as the threshold, which corresponds to "intermittent mild pain". Any value less than or equal to this (including "alert", "depressed", and "intermittent mild pain") is considered moderate or less pain.

2. For "abdominal_distension", we use 3 as the threshold, which represents "severe". Values less than or equal to 3 include "none", "slight", and "moderate" distension.

3. For "packed_cell_volume", we use 45% as the threshold, as specified in the original decision tree.

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for not surgical, 1 for surgical)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Note that this decision tree uses only a subset of the available features, focusing on those that were deemed most important in the original tree structure.
