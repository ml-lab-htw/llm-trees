Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I suggested earlier, here's a Python function that predicts whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] == 3  # severe
    nodes[1] = X["pulse"] > 80
    nodes[2] = X["rectal_examination"] == 1  # absent
    nodes[3] = X["pain"] >= 4  # moderate or severe pain

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # surgical
    elif X["abdominal_distension"] == 1:  # moderate
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        elif nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
    else:  # slight or none abdominal distension
        if nodes[3]:
            if X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 0:  # more than 1 liter
                prediction = 1  # surgical
            else:
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 1 for surgical cases, 0 for non-surgical cases.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features:
- abdominal_distension: (1 = moderate, 2 = none, 3 = severe, 4 = slight)
- pulse: Pulse (beats per minute)
- rectal_examination: (1 = absent, 2 = decreased, 3 = increased, 4 = normal)
- pain: (1 = alert, 2 = continuous severe pain, 3 = depressed, 4 = intermittent mild pain, 5 = intermittent severe pain)
- nasogastric_reflux: (0 = more
