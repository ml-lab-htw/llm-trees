Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific feature keys and encodings you've given, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for horse colic lesion surgery prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Abdominal Distension
    nodes[0] = X['abdominal_distension'] <= 3  # 3 represents 'severe'
    
    # Node 1: Degree of Pain
    nodes[1] = X['pain'] <= 3  # 3 represents 'depressed'
    
    # Node 2: Capillary Refill Time
    nodes[2] = X['capillary_refill_time'] <= 1  # 1 represents 'less than 3 seconds'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Non-Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Surgical
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the thresholds:

1. For 'abdominal_distension', we use <= 3 to split between 'moderate' (1) and 'severe' (3). Values 2 (none) and 4 (slight) are also considered non-severe.

2. For 'pain', we use <= 3 to differentiate between milder pain (1: alert, 2: continuous severe pain, 3: depressed) and more severe pain (4: intermittent mild pain, 5: intermittent severe pain).

3. For 'capillary_refill_time', we use <= 1 to distinguish between 'less than 3 seconds' (1) and 'more than 3 seconds' (0).

This function will return a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for non-surgical, 1 for surgical)
2. A list of three boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes
