Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize list for 5 inner nodes
    
    # Node conditions using the exact feature names and their encodings
    nodes[0] = X["abdominal_distension"] >= 3  # severe distension
    nodes[1] = X["pain"] <= 3  # up to depressed pain
    nodes[2] = X["pulse"] <= 80  # normal pulse threshold
    nodes[3] = X["nasogastric_reflux"] == 3  # none
    nodes[4] = X["peripheral_pulse"] == 3  # normal
    
    # Tree logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # abdominal_distension < severe
        if nodes[1]:  # pain <= depressed
            prediction = 0  # non-surgical
        else:  # pain > depressed
            if nodes[2]:  # pulse <= 80
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:  # pulse > 80
                prediction = 1  # surgical
    else:  # abdominal_distension >= severe
        if nodes[3]:  # nasogastric_reflux is none
            if nodes[4]:  # peripheral_pulse is normal
                prediction = 0  # non-surgical
            else:  # peripheral_pulse is not normal
                prediction = 1  # surgical
        else:  # nasogastric_reflux is not none
            prediction = 1  # surgical
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names from the provided list
- Uses the correct encodings for categorical variables
- Returns both the prediction (0 = no surgery, 1 = surgery) and the list of node conditions
- Uses clinically relevant thresholds
- Maintains the same structure as the previously described decision tree
- Has a maximum depth of 5

The thresholds and conditions are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Severe abdominal distension (encoded as 3)
- Pain level up to depressed (encoded as
