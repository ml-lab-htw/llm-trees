**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check average pain intensity
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5.0  # Threshold based on moderate pain level
    
    # Node 1: Check HADS depression score
    nodes[1] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 7.0  # Threshold based on minimal depression symptoms
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Node (`nodes[0]`):** The decision tree first evaluates the **average pain intensity** (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`). A score **≤ 5.0** indicates mild to moderate pain, which is associated with a better prognosis. Pain scores are typically measured on a scale from 0 to 10.

- **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):** If the average pain intensity is within the favorable range, the tree then assesses the **HADS depression score** (`hads_dep_score`). A score **≤ 7.0** suggests minimal to mild depressive symptoms, leading to a prediction of a **good outcome** (`prediction = 0`). Scores above 7 indicate higher levels of depression, which can negatively impact recovery.

- **Else Clause:** If the average pain intensity is **> 5.0**, it indicates higher pain levels, leading to a prediction of a **bad outcome** (`prediction = 1`), regardless of the depression score.

**Thresholds Used:**

- **Pain Intensity Threshold (5.0):** Pain scores are often categorized as:
  - **0-4:** Mild pain
  - **5-6:** Moderate pain
  - **7-10:** Severe pain
  The threshold of **5.0** separates mild from moderate pain.

- **HADS Depression Score Threshold (7.0):** The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) interprets scores as:
  - **0-7:** Normal (no depression)
  - **8-10:** Mild depression
  - **11-14:** Moderate depression
  - **15-21:** Severe depression
  A threshold of **7.0** distinguishes between non-depressed and potentially depressed individuals.

# Make the prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Good outcome" if prediction == 0 else "Bad outcome")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good outcome
Nodes truth values: [True, True]
```

In this example:
- **`nodes[0] = True`** because the average pain intensity is **4.5 ≤ 5.0**.
- **`nodes[1] = True`** because the HADS depression score is **6 ≤ 7.0**.
- Both conditions lead to a **prediction of 0 (Good outcome)**.

**Interpreting the Results:**

- If **average pain intensity** is low and **depression symptoms** are minimal, the individual is more likely to have a good recovery in terms of pain and disability six months after the injury.
- Higher pain intensity or significant depressive symptoms increase the risk of a bad outcome.

**Notes:**

- This decision tree emphasizes the importance of **pain management** and **mental health** in recovery after musculoskeletal trauma.
- Early interventions targeting pain relief and psychological support may improve long-term outcomes.

**Disclaimer:**

- The thresholds and feature importance are based on general clinical knowledge and may not represent specific patient populations.
- For clinical decision-making, it's essential to use validated models trained on relevant datasets.
