Based on the features provided and aiming for a decision tree of depth 3, here's the Python function that predicts the pain and disability outcome (`x1`: 0 = good, 1 = bad) at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. The function returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, where 1 indicates the condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # List to store the truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if average pain intensity is less than or equal to 5
    nodes[0] = int(X['bl_cpgs_intensity_average'] <= 5)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Node 0 condition is satisfied, predict 'good' outcome
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        nodes[1] = None  # Subsequent nodes are not evaluated
        nodes[2] = None
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if HADS depression score is less than or equal to 7
        nodes[1] = int(X['hads_dep_score'] <= 7)

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if pain region count is less than or equal to 10
            nodes[2] = int(X['pain_region_count'] <= 10)

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 is not evaluated

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Decision Tree:**

- **Node 0:** `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (average pain intensity) ≤ 5
  - **If True (1):** Predict **Good Outcome (0)**
  - **If False (0):** Move to Node 1

- **Node 1:** `hads_dep_score` (HADS depression score) ≤ 7
  - **If True (1):** Move to Node 2
  - **If False (0):** Predict **Bad Outcome (1)**

- **Node 2:** `pain_region_count` ≤ 10
  - **If True (1):** Predict **Good Outcome (0)**
  - **If False (0):** Predict **Bad Outcome (1)**

**Note on Features and Thresholds:**

- **bl_cpgs_intensity_average:** Average pain intensity reported by the patient. A score ≤ 5 indicates lower pain levels.
- **hads_dep_score:** Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression score. A score ≤ 7 is considered within the normal range.
- **pain_region_count:** The number of body regions where pain is reported. A count ≤ 10 suggests less widespread pain.

**Sample Usage:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 6,
    'hads_dep_score': 5,
    'pain_region_count': 8,
    # ... other features ...
}

# Predict outcome and get truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {'Bad' if prediction == 1 else 'Good'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good
Nodes: [0, 1, 1]
```

In this example:

- **Node 0 Condition Not Satisfied:** `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` is 6 (>5), so nodes[0] is 0.
- **Node 1 Condition Satisfied:** `hads_dep_score` is 5 (≤7), so nodes[1] is 1.
- **Node 2 Condition Satisfied:** `pain_region_count` is 8 (≤10), so nodes[2] is 1.
- **Final Prediction:** Good outcome (0).

**Ensure Input Dictionary Contains Required Features:**

Make sure that the input dictionary `X` contains the exact keys:

- `'bl_cpgs_intensity_average'`
- `'hads_dep_score'`
- `'pain_region_count'`

**Additional Notes:**

- The thresholds were chosen based on typical clinical interpretations of the scores.
- The nodes list helps trace the path taken in the decision tree for the given input.
