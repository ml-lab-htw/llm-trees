```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] <= 2  # Moderate or less
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 4 # Average pain <= 4

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes


```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  I've filled in the placeholders with concrete values:
   - `iss_category <= 2`: This checks if the injury severity category is "mild" (1) or "moderate" (2).
   - `bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 4`: This checks if the average pain intensity is 4 or less (on a 0-10 scale). This threshold is a reasonable starting point but should be validated with data.

2. **Clarity:** The code is structured to clearly reflect the decision tree's logic.  The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each node.

3. **Feature Names:** The code uses the correct feature names from the provided list.

4. **Target Encoding:**  The function returns 0 for "good" outcome and 1 for "bad" outcome, as specified.

**Example Usage:**

```python
patient_data = {
    'age': 30,
    'bmi': 25,
    # ... other features ...
    'iss_category': 3,  # Major injury
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 7, # High average pain
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Bad outcome)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False]
```

**Crucial Reminder:** This function is still based on a *hypothetical* tree. Its accuracy depends entirely on how well the chosen features and thresholds reflect the real-world relationships in your data. You **must** train a decision tree on real data to get a reliable model.
