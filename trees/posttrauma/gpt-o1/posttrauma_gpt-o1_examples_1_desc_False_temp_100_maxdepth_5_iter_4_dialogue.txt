**Explanation:**

This function predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma based on the provided features. It uses a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 and returns:

- **prediction**: `0` for a good outcome, `1` for a bad outcome.
- **nodes**: A list of binary values (`1` or `0`) indicating whether each condition in the nodes is satisfied (`1`) or not (`0`).

**Decision Tree Structure and Conditions:**

1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` ≤ 5
   - **Meaning**: Patients with an average pain intensity of 5 or less at baseline.
   - **Proceed to Node 1** if True; else, proceed to the else branch.

2. **If Node 0 is True:**

   - **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): `sf36_physical_summary` ≥ 50
     - **Meaning**: Patients with a physical health summary score of 50 or higher, indicating better physical functioning.
     - **Prediction**:
       - If True (`nodes[1] = 1`): **Good Outcome** (`prediction = 0`)
       - If False (`nodes[1] = 0`): **Bad Outcome** (`prediction = 1`)
   - **Nodes 2-4** (`nodes[2-4]`): Not evaluated in this path (set to `0`).

3. **If Node 0 is False:**

   - **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): `hads_dep_score` ≤ 7
     - **Meaning**: Patients with a depression score indicating normal to mild levels.
   - **If Node 1 is True:**

     - **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): `bmi` ≤ 30
       - **Meaning**: Patients who are not obese (BMI ≤ 30).
       - **Prediction**:
         - If True (`nodes[2] = 1`): **Good Outcome** (`prediction = 0`)
         - If False (`nodes[2] = 0`): **Bad Outcome** (`prediction = 1`)
     - **Nodes 3-4** (`nodes[3-4]`): Not evaluated in this path (set to `0`).

   - **If Node 1 is False:**

     - **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): `iss_score` ≤ 15
       - **Meaning**: Patients with a lower injury severity score, indicating less severe injuries.
     - **If Node 2 is True:**

       - **Node 3** (`nodes[3]`): `age` ≤ 50
         - **Meaning**: Younger patients who may have better recovery potential.
       - **If Node 3 is True:**

         - **Node 4** (`nodes[4]`): `hads_anx_score` ≤ 7
           - **Meaning**: Patients with normal to mild anxiety levels.
           - **Prediction**:
             - If True (`nodes[4] = 1`): **Good Outcome** (`prediction = 0`)
             - If False (`nodes[4] = 0`): **Bad Outcome** (`prediction = 1`)
       - **If Node 3 is False** (`age` > 50):

         - **Prediction**: **Bad Outcome** (`prediction = 1`)
         - **Node 4** (`nodes[4]`): Not evaluated in this path (set to `0`).

     - **If Node 2 is False** (`iss_score` > 15):

       - **Prediction**: **Bad Outcome** (`prediction = 1`)
       - **Nodes 3-4** (`nodes[3-4]`): Not evaluated in this path (set to `0`).

**Feature Thresholds and Rationale:**

- **bl_cpgs_intensity_average** (Baseline pain intensity average):
  - **Threshold**: 5
  - **Rationale**: Higher baseline pain intensity may predict worse outcomes.

- **sf36_physical_summary** (Physical health summary score):
  - **Threshold**: 50
  - **Rationale**: A score of 50 is average; higher scores indicate better physical health.

- **hads_dep_score** (Depression score from HADS):
  - **Threshold**: 7
  - **Rationale**: Scores ≤7 indicate normal to mild depression; higher scores may impact recovery.

- **bmi** (Body Mass Index):
  - **Threshold**: 30
  - **Rationale**: BMI >30 is considered obese, which may affect healing and outcomes.

- **iss_score** (Injury Severity Score):
  - **Threshold**: 15
  - **Rationale**: Higher scores indicate more severe injuries.

- **age**:
  - **Threshold**: 50
  - **Rationale**: Older age may be associated with slower recovery.

- **hads_anx_score** (Anxiety score from HADS):
  - **Threshold**: 7
  - **Rationale**: Scores ≤7 indicate normal to mild anxiety; higher levels may affect pain perception and recovery.

**Usage:**

- To make a prediction, input a dictionary `X` with the exact feature keys and values as specified.
- The function returns:
  - **prediction**: `0` (good outcome) or `1` (bad outcome).
  - **nodes**: A list `[nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2], nodes[3], nodes[4]]` with `1` or `0` indicating the truth values of each node's condition.

**Example of Input and Output:**

```python
# Example input feature values
X_example = {
    'age': 35,
    'bmi': 28,
    'hads_anx_score': 6,
    'hads_dep_score': 5,
    'iss_score': 12,
    'sf36_physical_summary': 55,
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 4,
    # ... other features can be included but are not used in the decision tree
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Good outcome" if prediction == 0 else "Bad outcome")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Keys**: Ensure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the provided feature keys, including casing and underscores.
- **Threshold Values**: The thresholds are set based on common clinical considerations but should ideally be determined using statistical analysis of a specific dataset.
- **Unused Features**: The function only uses specific features from the list provided. Unused features can be included in `X` but do not affect the prediction.
- **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list helps trace the path taken in the decision tree for a given prediction. A value of `1` means the condition at that node was satisfied.

**Disclaimer:**

- This function is a simplified representation based on hypothetical thresholds and may not reflect actual clinical outcomes.
- For real-world applications, the decision tree should be trained and validated using appropriate datasets and statistical methods.
- Clinical decisions should not be made solely based on this model without professional medical consultation.
