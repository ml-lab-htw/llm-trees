Here is the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: HADS depression score <= 7
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["hads_dep_score"] <= 7 else 0

    # Node 1: Pain intensity (worst) <= 6
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 6 else 0

    # Node 2: Sleep quality since injury <= 3
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["bl_sleep_quality"] <= 3 else 0

    # Decision logic
    if nodes[0]:  # HADS depression score <= 7
        if nodes[1]:  # Pain intensity (worst) <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Pain intensity (worst) > 6
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # HADS depression score > 7
        if nodes[2]:  # Sleep quality since injury <= 3
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Sleep quality since injury > 3
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:**  
  - Feature: `hads_dep_score` (HADS Depression Score)
  - Threshold: `<= 7`
  - Rationale: A HADS depression score of 7 or less indicates minimal depressive symptoms, which is associated with a better prognosis.
  
- **Node 1:**  
  - Feature: `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst` (Pain Intensity - Worst)
  - Threshold: `<= 6`
  - Rationale: Patients who report their worst pain intensity as 6 or less (on a scale of 0-10) are more likely to have a good outcome.
  
- **Node 2:**  
  - Feature: `bl_sleep_quality` (Sleep Quality Since Injury)
  - Threshold: `<= 3`
  - Rationale: Sleep quality rated as 3 or less (on a scale where lower scores indicate poorer sleep) is associated with a higher risk of a bad outcome.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a patient with the following data:

```python
patient_data = {
    "age": 45,
    "bmi": 27.5,
    "gender_birth": 2,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 2,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "smoker": 0,
    "days_in_hospital": 5,
    "iss_score": 9,
    "iss_category": 2,
    "nb_of_fractures": 1,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.8,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 70,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 45,
    "hads_anx_score": 6,
    "hads_dep_score": 5,
    "tsk_11_total": 25,
    "pseq_total": 40,
    "ies_r_total": 15,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 5,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 5,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 5,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 4,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 3,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 6,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 2,
    "pain_region_count": 1,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 10,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 12,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 7,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 4,
    "local_heat_average": 42,
    "remote_heat_average": 44,
    "local_cold_average": 18,
    "remote_cold_average": 16,
    "local_pressure_average": 250,
    "remote_pressure_average": 270,
    "crp_test": 3.5
}
```

Predicting the outcome:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", "Bad outcome" if prediction == 1 else "Good outcome")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good outcome
Nodes truth values: [1, 1, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Node 0:** `hads_dep_score` is 5, which is <= 7, so `nodes[0] = 1`.
- **Node 1:** `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst` is 6, which is <= 6, so `nodes[1] = 1`.
- **Node 2:** Not evaluated because the decision was made in the left branch.
- The prediction is a **Good outcome**.

**Notes:**

- **Threshold Values:**  
  The thresholds used in this decision tree are based on clinically relevant cut-off points:
  - **HADS Depression Score ≤ 7:** Scores of 0-7 are considered normal, 8-10 suggest mild depression, and ≥11 indicate moderate to severe depression.
  - **Pain Intensity (Worst) ≤ 6:** A pain score of 6 or less is often considered moderate pain.
  - **Sleep Quality Since Injury ≤ 3:** Assuming a sleep quality scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), scores ≤ 3 indicate poor to average sleep quality.

- **Features Importance:**  
  - **HADS Depression Score:** Depression can significantly affect recovery following musculoskeletal trauma.
  - **Pain Intensity (Worst):** Higher levels of pain intensity can impede rehabilitation and recovery.
  - **Sleep Quality Since Injury:** Poor sleep quality is associated with worse recovery outcomes.

**Disclaimer:**

The thresholds and features used in this function are illustrative and should be determined based on proper statistical analysis and expert clinical input. In a real-world scenario, machine learning algorithms and statistical methods would be employed to select the most predictive features and optimal thresholds.
