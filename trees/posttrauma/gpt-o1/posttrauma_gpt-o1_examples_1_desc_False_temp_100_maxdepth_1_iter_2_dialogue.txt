**Decision Tree:**

```
|--- bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5
|    |--- class: good outcome (x1 = 0)
|--- bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
|    |--- class: bad outcome (x1 = 1)
```

**Explanation:**

The most important feature selected is **bl_cpgs_intensity_average**, which represents the average pain intensity at baseline. Pain intensity is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater pain. A threshold of **5** is chosen as it represents moderate pain; scores above 5 indicate higher pain levels, which may be associated with worse outcomes.

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # good outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    return prediction, nodes
```

}

# Get prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print("Prediction:", "Good outcome (x1=0)" if prediction == 0 else "Bad outcome (x1=1)")
print("Node conditions satisfied:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Good outcome (x1=0)
Node conditions satisfied: [True]
```

**Notes:**

- **Threshold Selection:** A threshold of **5** for **bl_cpgs_intensity_average** is chosen based on the pain scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst possible pain. A score above 5 indicates moderate to severe pain, which may predict a worse outcome.
- **Node List:** The `nodes` list contains boolean values indicating whether the corresponding condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`).
- **Function Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted class label (`0` for good outcome, `1` for bad outcome).
  - `nodes`: A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. Since the tree has a maximum depth of 1, there is only one node condition.

**Conclusion:**

This simple decision tree uses the average baseline pain intensity to predict pain and disability outcomes at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. Patients with an average pain intensity of **5** or less are predicted to have a **good outcome**, while those with a higher intensity are predicted to have a **bad outcome**.
