---

**Decision Tree:**

```
|--- hads_dep_score <= 7
|    |--- Class: good (0)
|--- hads_dep_score > 7
|    |--- bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5
|        |--- Class: good (0)
|    |--- bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
|        |--- Class: bad (1)
```

---

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # Initialize a list to hold truth values for 2 inner nodes

    nodes[0] = int(X["hads_dep_score"] <= 7)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Class: good outcome
    else:
        nodes[1] = int(X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Class: good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Class: bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **First Split on `hads_dep_score`:**
   - **Feature:** `hads_dep_score` (HADS Depression Score)
   - **Threshold:** 7
     - A **HADS depression score ≤ 7** is considered within the normal range.
     - A score **> 7** indicates possible depression, which may impact recovery.

2. **Second Split on `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (if needed):**
   - **Feature:** `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (Baseline Pain Intensity Average)
   - **Threshold:** 5
     - A pain intensity **≤ 5** (on a 0-10 scale) is considered mild to moderate.
     - Pain intensity **> 5** indicates higher pain levels, potentially leading to worse outcomes.

**Nodes List (`nodes`):**

- `nodes[0]` corresponds to the truth value of the first condition (`hads_dep_score <= 7`).
  - `1` if the condition is met (True).
  - `0` if the condition is not met (False).
- `nodes[1]` corresponds to the truth value of the second condition (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5`).
  - Evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., the first condition is False).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input feature dictionary
X_example = {
    "hads_dep_score": 8,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6,
    # Other features can be included but are not used in this decision tree
}

# Predict the outcome
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Bad outcome (1)" if prediction == 1 else "Good outcome (0)")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Bad outcome (1)
Nodes truth values: [0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- If a patient has a **HADS depression score ≤ 7**, they are predicted to have a **good outcome** (0).
- If the score is **> 7**, we consider their **baseline pain intensity**:
  - If the **pain intensity ≤ 5**, predict a **good outcome** (0).
  - If the **pain intensity > 5**, predict a **bad outcome** (1).

**Threshold Justification:**

- **HADS Depression Score ≤ 7:**
  - A score of **7 or less** is generally considered within the normal range.
  - Scores **8-10** suggest possible mild depression.
- **Pain Intensity ≤ 5:**
  - On a scale from 0 to 10, **5** is the midpoint.
  - Scores **> 5** indicate moderate to severe pain.

**Feature Definitions:**

- `hads_dep_score`:
  - **Description:** Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression subscale score.
  - **Range:** 0 to 21, higher scores indicate greater depressive symptoms.
- `bl_cpgs_intensity_average`:
  - **Description:** Baseline Chronic Pain Grade Scale (CPGS) pain intensity average.
  - **Scale:** 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

**Note:** This simplified decision tree is designed for illustrative purposes. In a real-world scenario, thresholds should be determined based on statistical analysis of the dataset, and the model should be validated to ensure accuracy.
