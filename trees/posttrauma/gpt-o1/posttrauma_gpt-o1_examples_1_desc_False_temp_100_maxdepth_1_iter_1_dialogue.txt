Sure! Based on the features you've provided, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. The function returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. The entries of the list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

I've selected **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`** (pain intensity average) as the most significant feature for predicting the pain and disability outcome at 6 months.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0
    else:
        prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

- **Explanation:**
  - **nodes[0]:** Checks if the average pain intensity is less than or equal to **5**.
    - This threshold is meaningful assuming pain intensity is measured on a scale from 0 to 10.
  - **prediction:** If the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the function predicts `0` (good outcome). Otherwise, it predicts `1` (bad outcome).
