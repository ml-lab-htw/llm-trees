**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  I've used a threshold of 1 for `iss_category` (Mild) based on the provided encoding, and 7 for `hads_dep_score` as a common cutoff for mild depression. These are reasonable starting points, but optimal thresholds would need to be determined from data using techniques like cross-validation.
2. **Feature Encoding:** The function relies on the correct encoding of features as described in your prompt (e.g., `iss_category`: 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=major; `hads_dep_score`: 0-21). Ensure your input data adheres to this encoding.
3. **Missing Values:**  This function doesn't handle missing values. In a real-world application, you would need to implement strategies for imputation or missing value handling.
4. **Tree Structure:** The function directly implements the logic of the hypothetical decision tree described earlier.  The `nodes` list keeps track of the decisions made at each inner node (True/False for condition met/not met).
5. **Generalizability:** Remember that this is a hypothetical tree.  Its performance on real data will likely be suboptimal.  You *must* train a decision tree on real data to get a reliable and accurate classifier.


This improved version provides a functional implementation aligned with the prompt's requirements and addresses some practical considerations for real-world application.  Don't forget to train on real data!
