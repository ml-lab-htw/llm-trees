Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and I have selected meaningful thresholds for the splits based on the feature descriptions and their relevance to the target variable.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    (0 = good, 1 = bad) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if pain intensity (average) is less than or equal to 5.5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5.5
    
    # Node 1: Check if SF36v2 physical summary is greater than 40.0
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 40.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If pain intensity (average) <= 5.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If SF36v2 physical summary > 40.0
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # If SF36v2 physical summary <= 40.0
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # If pain intensity (average) > 5.5
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (pain intensity, average). A threshold of 5.5 is used:
   - If the average pain intensity is ≤ 5.5, the tree proceeds to Node 1.
   - If the average pain intensity is > 5.5, the outcome is classified as "bad" (1).

2. **Node 1**: The second split is based on the feature `sf36_physical_summary` (SF36v2 physical summary). A threshold of 40.0 is used:
   - If the physical summary score is > 40.0, the outcome is classified as "good" (0).
   - If the physical summary score is ≤ 40.0, the outcome is classified as "bad" (1).

### Key Points:
- The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names, and the values are the corresponding feature values.
- The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 = good, 1 = bad) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
- The thresholds (5.5 for pain intensity and 40.0 for physical summary) are chosen based on meaningful ranges and their relevance to the target variable.
