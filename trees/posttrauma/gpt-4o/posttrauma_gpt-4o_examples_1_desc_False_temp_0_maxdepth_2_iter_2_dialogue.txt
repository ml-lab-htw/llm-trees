Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and it uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions and domain knowledge.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    and returns the truth values of the inner nodes.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = good, 1 = bad) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the SF36 physical summary score is less than or equal to 40
    nodes[0] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40
    
    # Node 1: Check if the pain intensity (average) is greater than 5
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If SF36 physical summary <= 40
        if nodes[1]:  # If pain intensity (average) > 5
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # If pain intensity (average) <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # If SF36 physical summary > 40
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the **SF36 physical summary** score. A score of 40 or less indicates poor physical health, which is likely associated with a bad outcome.
2. **Node 1**: The second split is based on the **pain intensity (average)**. A value greater than 5 indicates high pain intensity, which is also associated with a bad outcome.

### Example Usage:
Here is an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "age": 35,
    "bmi": 25.4,
    "gender_birth": 1,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 3,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "smoker": 0,
    "days_in_hospital": 5,
    "iss_score": 15,
    "iss_category": 2,
    "nb_of_fractures": 1,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.8,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 70,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 35,
    "hads_anx_score": 8,
    "hads_dep_score": 6,
    "tsk_11_total": 25,
    "pseq_total": 40,
    "ies_r_total": 30,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 10,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 10,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 10,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 7,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 9,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 4,
    "pain_region_count": 3,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 50,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 15,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 3,
    "local_heat_average": 45,
    "remote_heat_average": 50,
    "local_cold_average": 10,
    "remote_cold_average": 15,
    "local_pressure_average": 300,
    "remote_pressure_average": 350,
    "crp_test": 5.0
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (bad outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Output:
For the example input:
- **Prediction**: `1` (bad outcome)
- **Nodes**: `[True, True]` (both conditions are satisfied)

This function is simple, interpretable, and adheres to the constraints of a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.
