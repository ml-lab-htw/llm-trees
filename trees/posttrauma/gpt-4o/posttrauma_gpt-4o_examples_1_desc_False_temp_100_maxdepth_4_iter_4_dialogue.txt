Here is a Python function implementing a decision tree classifier with maximum depth 4, using the features and target variable you've provided. This decision tree is created to predict whether pain and disability outcome following musculoskeletal trauma at 6 months is good (0) or bad (1). The function also returns a list of truth values for the nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    # Decision Tree Logic
    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] > 15  # First split on injury severity score
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40  # General physical health severity threshold
    nodes[2] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] > 7  # Worst pain intensity threshold
    nodes[3] = X["bl_sleep_quality"] < 2  # Sleep quality threshold (1: very low quality)

    # Navigate the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # ISS score > 15 (severe injuries)
        if nodes[1]:  # Physical health summary <= 40 (poor physical health)
            if nodes[2]:  # Worst pain intensity > 7
                if nodes[3]:  # Very poor sleep quality
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:  
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # ISS score <= 15 (less severe injuries)
        if nodes[2]:  # Worst pain intensity > 7
            if nodes[3]:  # Very poor sleep quality
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the ISS (Injury Severity Score). Severe injuries (ISS score > 15) are more likely to lead to a bad outcome (1). ISS is a widely used metric to assess trauma severity.
2. **Node 1**: For severe injuries, the next split is based on the SF36 physical health score. A lower score (≤ 40) indicates poor physical health, which increases the likelihood of a bad outcome.
3. **Node 2**: High worst pain intensity (bl_cpgs_intensity_worst > 7 on a scale of 0–10) is a strong indicator of a bad outcome. Persistent and severe pain correlates with worse recovery.
4. **Node 3**: Poor sleep quality (bl_sleep_quality < 2 on a subjective scale) further exacerbates the problems, making a bad outcome more likely.

### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: `X`, a dictionary where keys are feature names (spelled exactly as in the dataset) and values are the feature values for a single case.
- **Output**: A tuple:
  - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = good outcome, 1 = bad outcome).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (0 or 1) for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
