Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and target variable. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and the thresholds are chosen based on meaningful values derived from the feature descriptions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    (0 = good, 1 = bad) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the pain intensity (average) is less than or equal to 5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5
    
    # Node 1: Check if the SF36 physical summary score is greater than 40
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 40
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If pain intensity (average) <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # If SF36 physical summary > 40
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # If SF36 physical summary <= 40
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # If pain intensity (average) > 5
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (pain intensity, average). A threshold of 5 is chosen because higher pain intensity is likely associated with worse outcomes.
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` ≤ 5, proceed to Node 1.
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` > 5, predict a bad outcome (1).

2. **Node 1**: The second split is based on the feature `sf36_physical_summary` (SF36v2 physical summary). A threshold of 40 is chosen because higher physical function scores are associated with better outcomes.
   - If `sf36_physical_summary` > 40, predict a good outcome (0).
   - If `sf36_physical_summary` ≤ 40, predict a bad outcome (1).

}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Good outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Output:
For the example input:
- `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` = 4, which satisfies the condition `<= 5` (Node 0 is `True`).
- `sf36_physical_summary` = 45, which satisfies the condition `> 40` (Node 1 is `True`).
- The prediction is `0` (Good outcome).
