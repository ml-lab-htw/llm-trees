Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the provided features and the target variable (`x1: pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma`):

### Decision Tree Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad)
    based on a decision tree of depth 2.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if "bl_cpgs_intensity_average" (average pain intensity) is <= 5.5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5.5
    
    # Node 1: Check if "sf36_physical_summary" (SF36v2 physical summary) is <= 40
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["hads_anx_score"] <= 7  # Check if HADS anxiety score is <= 7
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the average pain intensity (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`). If it is less than or equal to 5.5, we proceed to the next split. Otherwise, we split based on anxiety score (`hads_anx_score`).
2. **Node 1** (Left Branch): If the average pain intensity is less than or equal to 5.5, we check the physical health summary score (`sf36_physical_summary`). Lower scores (≤ 40) indicate worse physical health and are associated with a bad outcome (1). Higher scores (> 40) are associated with a good outcome (0).
3. **Node 1** (Right Branch): If the average pain intensity is greater than 5.5, we check the anxiety score (`hads_anx_score`). Lower anxiety scores (≤ 7) are associated with a good outcome (0), while higher scores (> 7) are associated with a bad outcome (1).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input

    "age": 35,
    "bmi": 27.5,
    "gender_birth": 1,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 3,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "smoker": 0,
    "days_in_hospital": 3,
    "iss_score": 25,
    "iss_category": 2,
    "nb_of_fractures": 1,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.75,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 70,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 45,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 35,
    "hads_anx_score": 8,
    "hads_dep_score": 5,
    "tsk_11_total": 25,
    "pseq_total": 45,
    "ies_r_total": 30,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 10,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 10,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 10,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 7,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 8,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 4,
    "pain_region_count": 3,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 20,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 15,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 2,
    "local_heat_average": 42,
    "remote_heat_average": 45,
    "local_cold_average": 10,
    "remote_cold_average": 12,
    "local_pressure_average": 200,
    "remote_pressure_average": 250,
    "crp_test": 3.5
}

# Get prediction and truth values of inner nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", "Bad outcome" if prediction == 1 else "Good outcome")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

### Example Output:
For the example input above:
```
Prediction: Bad outcome
Nodes truth values: [False, False]
```

This indicates that the average pain intensity is greater than 5.5, and the anxiety score is greater than 7, leading to a bad outcome prediction.
