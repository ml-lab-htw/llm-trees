Here is the Python function for the decision tree based on the given features and target variable (`x1: pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad)`) with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad)
    based on the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
    tuple: A prediction (0 = good, 1 = bad) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # List to store truth values for the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average' (pain intensity average) is <= 5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5

    if nodes[0]:  # If pain intensity average is <= 5
        # Node 1: Check if 'sf36_physical_summary' (SF36 physical summary) is > 40
        nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 40

        if nodes[1]:  # If SF36 physical summary is > 40
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # If SF36 physical summary is <= 40
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # If pain intensity average is > 5
        # Node 1: Check if 'hads_dep_score' (HADS depression score) is <= 10
        nodes[1] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 10

        if nodes[1]:  # If HADS depression score is <= 10
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # If HADS depression score is > 10
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 0 (Root Node):**  
   - The decision tree first checks if the `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (pain intensity average) is ≤ 5.  
   - This feature is used as the root node because pain intensity is a strong predictor of pain and disability outcomes.

2. **Node 1 (Left Subtree):**  
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` is ≤ 5, the tree checks if `sf36_physical_summary` (SF36 physical summary) is > 40.  
   - A higher SF36 physical summary score suggests better physical functioning and is associated with a good outcome.

3. **Node 1 (Right Subtree):**  
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` is > 5, the tree checks if `hads_dep_score` (HADS depression score) is ≤ 10.  
   - A lower HADS depression score indicates less depression, but in this case, even low depression with high pain intensity leads to a bad outcome.

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Good outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]

### Explanation of Example:
- `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` = 4 → `True` for Node 0 (≤ 5).  
- `sf36_physical_summary` = 45 → `True` for Node 1 (> 40).  
- Final prediction: 0 (Good outcome).  

This function is flexible and can be updated if thresholds or feature importance change.
