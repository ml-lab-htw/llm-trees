### Explanation:
1. **Node 0 (sf36_physical_summary <= 35):** The SF36 physical summary score is a well-known measure of physical health and functioning. A low score (below or equal to 35) suggests poor physical health, which could indicate a higher likelihood of a bad outcome (pain and disability). Hence, this is chosen as the first split.

2. **Node 1 (eq5d_5l_index_score <= 0.7):** For patients with lower physical functioning, the EQ-5D-5L index score is used as the second feature to further classify outcomes. This score measures overall health quality, and a low score (<= 0.7) suggests a poor health state, leading to a prediction of a bad outcome.

3. **Prediction:**
   - If both conditions (low physical health and low EQ-5D-5L score) are met, the prediction is 1 (bad outcome).
   - If only physical health is low but the EQ-5D-5L score is higher, the prediction is 0 (good outcome).
   - If physical health is good (sf36_physical_summary > 35), the prediction is directly 0 (good outcome).
