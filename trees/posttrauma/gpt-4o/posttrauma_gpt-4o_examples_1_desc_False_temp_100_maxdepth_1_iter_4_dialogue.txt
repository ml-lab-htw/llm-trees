Here is your decision tree classifier implementation as a Python function with a maximum depth of 1. Based on domain knowledge and the feature descriptions, I have selected a plausible feature ("bl_cpgs_intensity_worst") and threshold to predict the target ("x1: pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma"). Feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst` (pain intensity worst) is chosen because it seems directly related to pain and disability outcome.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma 
    and returns a prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary of input features.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = good, 1 = bad) and 
               a list of truth values for the internal nodes.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Initialize a list to track whether inner nodes are satisfied (binary: 1 or 0)
    
    # Evaluate the condition of the first (and only) node:
    # Threshold set to 7 based on plausible reasoning (e.g., pain intensity over 7 is indicative of bad outcome).
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7  

    if nodes[0]:  # If worst pain intensity is <= 7
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome (class 0)
    else:  # If worst pain intensity is > 7
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (class 1)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage
Here is a small example demonstrating how to use the function with input data:

```python
# Test input features (replace with actual data)
test_input = {
    "age": 35,
    "bmi": 25.3,
    "gender_birth": 1,  # Male
    "ethnic_group": 1,  # White
    "education_age": 3,  # 20 or over
    "working_at_baseline": 1,  # Working
    "smoker": 0,  # Non-smoker
    "days_in_hospital": 5,
    "iss_score": 18,
    "iss_category": 2,  # Moderate
    "nb_of_fractures": 2,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,  # No penetrating injury
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.75,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 85,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 55,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 40,
    "hads_anx_score": 6,
    "hads_dep_score": 5,
    "tsk_11_total": 30,
    "pseq_total": 25,
    "ies_r_total": 18,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 6,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 5,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 7,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 5,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 6,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 8,  # Worst pain intensity (key feature here)
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 4,
    "pain_region_count": 3,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 50,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 15,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 3,
    "local_heat_average": 42,
    "remote_heat_average": 45,
    "local_cold_average": 15,
    "remote_cold_average": 20,
    "local_pressure_average": 200,
    "remote_pressure_average": 250,
    "crp_test": 5
}

# Example Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(test_input)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Outputs: 1 (Bad outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Outputs: [False] because bl_cpgs_intensity_worst > 7
```

### Explanation
1. **Feature selection:** The feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst` (worst pain intensity) is chosen because it is sensibly correlated to pain and disability outcomes.
2. **Threshold:** A threshold of `7` is used for the split, assuming that a worst pain intensity score >7 indicates a "Bad" outcome.
3. **Prediction:** If the condition `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst <= 7` is true, the outcome is `0 (Good)`. Otherwise, the outcome is `1 (Bad)`.

Feel free to adjust the threshold or feature selection if you have a better understanding of the data or target distribution!
