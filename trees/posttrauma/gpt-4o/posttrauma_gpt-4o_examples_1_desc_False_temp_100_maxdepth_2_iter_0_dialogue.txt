### Explanation:

1. **First Split (Node 0)**: The first decision is based on the **injury severity score category** (`iss_category`). If the injury is major (`iss_category >= 3`), the prediction will proceed along a different path compared to if the injury is mild or moderate.
   
2. **Second Split for Major Injuries (Node 1)**: If the injury is major, the next decision is based on **average pain intensity** (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`). If the pain intensity is high (above 5), the prediction is that the outcome is bad (`1`). Otherwise, the outcome is predicted to be good (`0`).

3. **Second Split for Mild/Moderate Injuries (Node 1)**: If the injury is not major, the next decision is based on **anxiety levels** (`hads_anx_score`). High anxiety scores (above 7) lead to a prediction of a bad outcome (`1`), while lower anxiety scores result in a prediction of a good outcome (`0`).

### Output:
- **Prediction**: The function returns `0` (good outcome) or `1` (bad outcome).
- **Nodes**: A list of truth values for the conditions at each decision node. For example, if `nodes[0]` is `True`, the first condition (injury severity) was satisfied, and if `nodes[1]` is `False`, the second condition (pain intensity or anxiety score) was not satisfied.
