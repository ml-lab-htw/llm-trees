Given the features and the depth of the decision tree mentioned in your request, let's build a Python function to predict the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad) based on the selected most important features. I'll use features such as **age** and **bmi** for this example:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['age'] <= 40
    nodes[1] = X['bmi'] <= 25
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # good
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # bad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # good
            
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'age': 35,
    'bmi': 27,
    'gender_birth': 1,

    'local_cold_average': 22,
    'remote_cold_average': 21,
    'local_pressure_average': 300,
    'remote_pressure_average': 320,
    'crp_test': 1.2
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if age is less than or equal to 40 years.
2. **Node 1** checks if BMI is less than or equal to 25.

### Logic:
- If the age is less than or equal to 40:
  - If BMI is less than or equal to 25, the outcome is good (0).
  - If BMI is greater than 25, the outcome is bad (1).
- If the age is greater than 40:
  - If BMI is less than or equal to 25, the outcome is bad (1).
  - If BMI is greater than 25, the outcome is good (0).

This function returns the prediction, as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, which helps in understanding the decision-making process.
