To create a decision tree that adheres to the provided feature names, target variable, and the desired function format, we will implement a tree of depth 5. The output will include a prediction of whether the pain and disability outcome at 6 months is good (0) or bad (1), as well as a list of truth values (`nodes`) representing whether the conditions at each decision point are satisfied.

Here's how the function will look:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Placeholder for node truth values
    
    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["bmi"] > 25  # BMI > 25 indicates higher risk for worse outcome
    nodes[1] = X["age"] > 50  # Older age is associated with a worse outcome
    nodes[2] = X["iss_score"] > 15  # High injury severity score indicates worse outcome
    nodes[3] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5  # Pain intensity >= 6 indicates worse outcome
    nodes[4] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] < 40  # Lower SF-36 physical health scores indicate worse outcome

    # Navigate the tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Tree

1. **`bmi > 25`** (Node 0): Higher BMI is linked to poorer outcomes post-muskuloskeletal trauma due to increased mechanical stress on the body and comorbidities (like obesity-related inflammation).
2. **`age > 50`** (Node 1): Older individuals may have worse outcomes due to slower recovery, increased likelihood of comorbidities, and reduced physical resilience.
3. **`iss_score > 15`** (Node 2): A higher injury severity score indicates major trauma, which is likely to affect recovery negatively.
4. **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`** (Node 3): High pain intensity (e.g., average pain greater than 5) is a strong predictor of poorer functional outcomes.
5. **`sf36_physical_summary < 40`** (Node 4): A low SF-36 physical health score indicates poor physical functioning, which is another negative prognostic indicator.

### Example Usage

Let's input a sample feature dictionary for testing:

```python
# Example input
X_sample = {
    "age": 52,
    "bmi": 28,
    "gender_birth": 1,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 3,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "smoker": 0,
    "days_in_hospital": 5,
    "iss_score": 18,
    "iss_category": 3,
    "nb_of_fractures": 2,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.8,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 75,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 35,
    "hads_anx_score": 8,
    "hads_dep_score": 7,
    "tsk_11_total": 30,
    "pseq_total": 40,
    "ies_r_total": 15,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 5,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 5,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 5,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 7,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 9,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 5,
    "pain_region_count": 4,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 50,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 14,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 4,
    "local_heat_average": 40,
    "remote_heat_average": 42,
    "local_cold_average": 25,
    "remote_cold_average": 24,
    "local_pressure_average": 300,
    "remote_pressure_average": 320,
    "crp_test": 4.5,
}

# Prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)

print("Prediction:", "Bad outcome" if prediction == 1 else "Good outcome")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Output for the Example Input

Based on the input, the function will return:

- **Prediction**: Bad outcome
- **Nodes**: [True, True, True, True, True]

This means all the conditions in the decision tree were satisfied, leading to the predicted outcome of "bad" (1).
