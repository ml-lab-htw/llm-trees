Based on your request, I will create a Python function that implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. This function will classify the **pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma** (0 = good, 1 = bad) based on the features provided.

The decision tree will include meaningful thresholds for the selected features. For this example, I'll select the following features as they are likely to be important predictors based on their descriptions:

1. **iss_score**: Injury Severity Score (higher scores indicate more severe injuries, which may lead to worse outcomes).
2. **bl_cpgs_intensity_average**: Average pain intensity at baseline (higher pain intensity is likely associated with worse outcomes).

### Decision Tree Function:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    based on a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing feature values. Keys must match the exact feature names.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad).
        nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Define the decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] > 15  # First split: Injury Severity Score threshold
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5.0  # Second split: Baseline pain intensity threshold
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 3.0  # Second split: Baseline pain intensity threshold
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **First Split (`nodes[0]`)**:
   - If `iss_score` (Injury Severity Score) is greater than 15, the injury is considered severe, and we proceed to the next split based on baseline pain intensity.
   - If `iss_score` is less than or equal to 15, the injury is less severe, and we again proceed to the next split based on baseline pain intensity.

2. **Second Split (`nodes[1]`)**:
   - For severe injuries (`iss_score > 15`), if `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (baseline pain intensity) is greater than 5.0, the outcome is predicted as **bad** (1). Otherwise, it is also predicted as **bad** (1).
   - For less severe injuries (`iss_score <= 15`), if `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` is greater than 3.0, the outcome is predicted as **bad** (1). Otherwise, it is predicted as **good** (0).

# Predict outcome
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

# Display results
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (bad outcome)
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Notes:
- The thresholds (e.g., `iss_score > 15`, `bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5.0`) are chosen based on plausible values from the feature descriptions. These can be fine-tuned with actual data.
- The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes, which can be used to trace the decision path through the tree.
