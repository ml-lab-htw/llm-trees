Given your detailed feature descriptions and examples, here is a Python function that replicates the decision tree to classify whether the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma is good (0) or bad (1). In this decision tree, we assume that the most relevant features are `bmi`, `gender_birth`, and `age` based on typical medical risk factors for pain and disability outcomes.

Let's construct the decision tree and the prediction function with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node
    # Assume there's a threshold value for bmi that is meaningful (e.g., 25)
    nodes[0] = X["bmi"] <= 25
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If bmi is less than or equal to 25
        # Second node, further decision based on gender_birth
        nodes[1] = X["gender_birth"] == 1  # 1 for male
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome, assuming gender_birth 2 (female) or 3 (not disclosed)
    else:
        # If bmi is greater than 25
        # Second node, further decision based on age
        nodes[1] = X["age"] <= 50
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome, assuming age greater than 50
    
    return prediction, nodes

### Explanation
1. **Node 1**: The root node checks if the `bmi` is less than or equal to 25. If true, it goes to the second decision.
2. **Node 2**: If `bmi` <= 25, it then checks the `gender_birth`. If `gender_birth` is 1 (male), the prediction is 0 (good outcome), otherwise, it is also 0 (good outcome), assuming the other gender categories (female or not disclosed) have a good outcome in this split.
3. **Node 3**: If `bmi` > 25, it checks the `age`. If `age` is less than or equal to 50, the prediction is 1 (bad outcome), otherwise 1 (bad outcome).

This decision tree uses two levels, or nodes, for the classification and returns the prediction along with a list of boolean values indicating which nodes' conditions were satisfied.
