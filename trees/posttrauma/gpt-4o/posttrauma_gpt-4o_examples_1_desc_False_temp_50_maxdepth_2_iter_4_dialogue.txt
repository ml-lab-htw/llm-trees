Here is a Python function implementing the decision tree classifier for predicting the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. The tree has a maximum depth of 2 and uses meaningful thresholds based on the given features. The function returns the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values with keys matching the dataset.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 = good, 1 = bad) and a list of truth values
               for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Decision tree logic
    # Node 0: Check if the pain intensity (average) is greater than 5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5

    if nodes[0]:  # If pain intensity (average) > 5
        # Node 1: Check if the number of fractures is greater than 1
        nodes[1] = X["nb_of_fractures"] > 1
        if nodes[1]:  # If number of fractures > 1
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # If number of fractures <= 1
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # If pain intensity (average) <= 5
        # Node 1: Check if the SF36 physical summary score is less than or equal to 40
        nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40
        if nodes[1]:  # If SF36 physical summary <= 40
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # If SF36 physical summary > 40
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0:** The root node splits based on the feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (pain intensity, average). A threshold of 5 is chosen, where higher pain intensity is associated with a worse outcome.
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` > 5, the tree proceeds to Node 1.
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` <= 5, the tree proceeds to an alternate Node 1.

2. **Node 1 (Right Subtree):** If the pain intensity (average) is greater than 5, the tree checks the `nb_of_fractures` (number of fractures). A threshold of 1 is chosen:
   - If `nb_of_fractures` > 1, the outcome is predicted as **bad** (1).
   - If `nb_of_fractures` <= 1, the outcome is still predicted as **bad** (1).

3. **Node 1 (Left Subtree):** If the pain intensity (average) is less than or equal to 5, the tree checks the `sf36_physical_summary` (SF36 physical summary score). A threshold of 40 is chosen:
   - If `sf36_physical_summary` <= 40, the outcome is predicted as **bad** (1).
   - If `sf36_physical_summary` > 40, the outcome is predicted as **good** (0).
