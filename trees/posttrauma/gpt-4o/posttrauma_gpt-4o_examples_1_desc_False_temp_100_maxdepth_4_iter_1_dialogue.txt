Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the given problem and features related to "pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma." The decision tree is kept to a depth of 4, with meaningful values for thresholds based on feature descriptions where applicable.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # List to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Decision rules with thresholds
    nodes[0] = X['iss_score'] > 15  # Injury Severity Score > 15 is significant
    nodes[1] = X['sf36_physical_summary'] <= 40  # Poor physical function (threshold based on domain knowledge)
    nodes[2] = X['bl_cpgs_intensity_average'] > 5  # Average pain intensity > 5 is meaningful
    nodes[3] = X['age'] >= 50  # Age threshold for older population

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # iss_score > 15
        if nodes[1]:  # sf36_physical_summary <= 40
            if nodes[2]:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
                if nodes[3]:  # age >= 50
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:  # age < 50
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5
                if nodes[3]:  # age >= 50
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:  # age < 50
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # sf36_physical_summary > 40
            if nodes[2]:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # iss_score <= 15
        if nodes[1]:  # sf36_physical_summary <= 40
            if nodes[2]:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # sf36_physical_summary > 40
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Root Node (`nodes[0]`): Injury Severity Score (`iss_score`)**  
   If the `iss_score` is greater than 15, the injury is classified as more severe and likely to result in a bad outcome.
   
2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`): SF-36 Physical Summary**  
   A physical function score (`sf36_physical_summary`) less than or equal to 40 suggests poor physical recovery potential, moving toward a bad outcome.  

3. **Third Node (`nodes[2]`): Baseline Pain Intensity Average**  
   Higher baseline pain intensity (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`) typically predicts a worse outcome.  

4. **Fourth Node (`nodes[3]`): Age**  
   Older patients (`age >= 50`) may have worse recovery outcomes due to slower healing and other age-related factors.

### Example Input and Output:
#### Input:
```python
features = {
    'age': 55,
    'bmi': 24.5,
    'gender_birth': 1,

    'iss_score': 20,
    'iss_category': 3,
    'nb_of_fractures': 2,
    'penetrating_injury': 0,
    'eq5d_5l_index_score': 0.65,

    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 6,
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_now': 7,
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_worst': 9,
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_least': 4,
    'pain_region_count': 3,
    'pe_total_percent_baseline': 20,
    'paindetect_grand_total': 15,
    'bl_sleep_24hrs': 6,
    'bl_sleep_quality': 3,
    'local_heat_average': 45,
    'remote_heat_average': 40,
    'local_cold_average': 10,
    'remote_cold_average': 15,
    'local_pressure_average': 75,
    'remote_pressure_average': 60,
    'crp_test': 10
}
```

#### Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction: 1 (Bad outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Nodes: [True, True, True, True]
```

Here:
- `iss_score > 15` → `True`
- `sf36_physical_summary <= 40` → `True`
- `bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5` → `True`
- `age >= 50` → `True`

This output indicates that the patient is predicted to have a **bad outcome** along with the truth values for each decision tree node.
