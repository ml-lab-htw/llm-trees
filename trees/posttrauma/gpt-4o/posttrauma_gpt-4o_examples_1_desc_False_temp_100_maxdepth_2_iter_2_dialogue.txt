### Explanation:
- **Node 1**: The decision tree first checks if the injury severity score category (`iss_category`) is "major" (i.e., `iss_category == 3`). If this condition is true, the outcome is predicted as "bad" (`1`).
- **Node 2**: If the injury severity score is not major, the tree checks the average pain intensity (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`). If the average pain intensity is greater than 5, the outcome is predicted as "bad" (`1`); otherwise, it is predicted as "good" (`0`).

The function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for each inner node.
