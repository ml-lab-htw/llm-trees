Here is a Python function implementing a decision tree of depth 3 for predicting "pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma" using the provided features and their descriptions. The function also returns a list indicating whether each condition at the decision tree's inner nodes is satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the outcome (x1: 0 = good, 1 = bad) and provides the truth values for inner nodes.

    Arguments:
    X (dict): A dictionary of feature inputs with keys matching the exact spelling given in the feature list.

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction (int), nodes (list of int))
           prediction: 0 for good, 1 for bad outcome,
           nodes: A list where 1 indicates the corresponding inner node condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize the nodes' truth values
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5.0  # Average pain intensity above 5 indicates higher risk
    nodes[1] = X["crp_test"] > 3.0  # CRP levels above 3.0 mg/L associated with inflammation
    nodes[2] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] < 40.0  # SF36v2 Physical Summary below 40 indicates worse physical health

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # First condition
        if nodes[1]:  # Second condition
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:  # Third condition
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Tree
1. **Node 1:** The first split is on `"bl_cpgs_intensity_average"`. A pain intensity average greater than 5.0 is associated with worse outcomes.
2. **Node 2:** If the first condition is satisfied, the second split checks `"crp_test"`. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (greater than 3.0 mg/L) indicate systemic inflammation, which can worsen recovery outcomes.
3. **Node 3:** If the first condition is not satisfied, the third split evaluates `"sf36_physical_summary"`. Poor physical health scores (below 40) are typically associated with worse outcomes.

### Inputs
The function expects a dictionary `X` where:
- Keys correspond to the exact feature names provided.
- Values are the feature values for a given patient or sample.

### Outputs
1. **Prediction:** Either `0` (good outcome) or `1` (bad outcome).
2. **Nodes:** A list of truth values (`1` = condition satisfied, `0` = condition not satisfied) corresponding to the splits (inner nodes) in the decision tree.

### Example Usage
```python
# Input example
sample_input = {
    "age": 35,
    "bmi": 24.5,
    "gender_birth": 1,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 3,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "smoker": 0,
    "days_in_hospital": 5,
    "iss_score": 15,
    "iss_category": 2,
    "nb_of_fractures": 2,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.8,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 75,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 38,
    "hads_anx_score": 8,
    "hads_dep_score": 6,
    "tsk_11_total": 22,
    "pseq_total": 30,
    "ies_r_total": 15,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 5,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 5,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 5,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6.0,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 7.0,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 8.0,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 3.0,
    "pain_region_count": 4,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 50.0,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 19,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 5.0,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 2,
    "local_heat_average": 45.0,
    "remote_heat_average": 47.0,
    "local_cold_average": 18.0,
    "remote_cold_average": 20.0,
    "local_pressure_average": 300.0,
    "remote_pressure_average": 310.0,
    "crp_test": 4.0
}

# Predict outcome
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)

print(f"Prediction: {'Bad' if prediction == 1 else 'Good'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Example Output
Using the above `sample_input`, the output would be:
```
Prediction: Bad
Nodes: [1, 1, 0]
```

Here, the first condition (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5.0`) and the second condition (`crp_test > 3.0`) are satisfied, but the third condition is not evaluated as the tree does not reach that node. The predicted outcome is "Bad".
