Here is a Python function implementing a decision tree of depth 2 for predicting the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (`x1`). The tree uses meaningful thresholds based on the provided feature descriptions. This function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (x1).
    Target: 0 = good, 1 = bad.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    # Initialize the list of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if EQ-5D-5L index score is less than or equal to 0.6
    nodes[0] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.6

    # Node 1: Check if SF36 physical summary is less than or equal to 40
    if nodes[0]:  # If Node 0 condition is true
        nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # If Node 0 condition is false
        nodes[1] = X["hads_anx_score"] > 10
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0 (Root Node)**:
   - The first split is based on the `eq5d_5l_index_score`, which measures health-related quality of life. A lower score (≤ 0.6) indicates worse health, so this is the root node.
   - If `eq5d_5l_index_score` ≤ 0.6, we proceed to Node 1a.
   - If `eq5d_5l_index_score` > 0.6, we proceed to Node 1b.

2. **Node 1a (Left Subtree)**:
   - If `eq5d_5l_index_score` ≤ 0.6, we check the `sf36_physical_summary`, which measures physical health. A lower score (≤ 40) indicates worse physical health.
   - If `sf36_physical_summary` ≤ 40, the prediction is **1 (bad outcome)**.
   - If `sf36_physical_summary` > 40, the prediction is **0 (good outcome)**.

3. **Node 1b (Right Subtree)**:
   - If `eq5d_5l_index_score` > 0.6, we check the `hads_anx_score`, which measures anxiety levels. A higher score (> 10) indicates significant anxiety.
   - If `hads_anx_score` > 10, the prediction is **1 (bad outcome)**.
   - If `hads_anx_score` ≤ 10, the prediction is **0 (good outcome)**.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.5,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 35,
    "hads_anx_score": 8,
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (bad outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Output:
- `nodes[0]`: True because `eq5d_5l_index_score` (0.5) ≤ 0.6.
- `nodes[1]`: True because `sf36_physical_summary` (35) ≤ 40.
- Prediction is **1 (bad outcome)** because both conditions in the left subtree are satisfied.

This function is flexible and can handle any input dictionary `X` with the required feature keys.
