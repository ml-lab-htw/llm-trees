Sure, let's create a Python function based on the decision tree provided. This function will classify whether the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma is good (0) or bad (1). The function will return a single prediction along with a list of the truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 8 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["age"] > 30
    nodes[1] = X["iss_score"] > 15
    nodes[2] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 50
    nodes[3] = X["bmi"] <= 25
    nodes[4] = X["hads_dep_score"] > 7
    nodes[5] = X["ies_r_intrusion"] <= 20
    nodes[6] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] > 0.5
    nodes[7] = X["sf36_mental_summary"] <= 40

    if nodes[0]: # age > 30
        if nodes[1]: # iss_score > 15
            if nodes[2]: # sf36_physical_summary <= 50
                prediction = 1
            else:
                if nodes[3]: # bmi <= 25
                    prediction = 1
                else:
                    prediction = 0
        else:
            if nodes[4]: # hads_dep_score > 7
                if nodes[5]: # ies_r_intrusion <= 20
                    prediction = 0
                else:
                    prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
    else:
        if nodes[6]: # eq5d_5l_index_score > 0.5
            if nodes[7]: # sf36_mental_summary <= 40
                prediction = 1
            else:
                prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the age is greater than 30.
2. **Node 1**: Checks if the ISS score is greater than 15.
3. **Node 2**: Checks if the SF36 physical summary score is less than or equal to 50.
4. **Node 3**: Checks if the BMI is less than or equal to 25.
5. **Node 4**: Checks if the HADS depression score is greater than 7.
6. **Node 5**: Checks if the IES-R intrusion score is less than or equal to 20.
7. **Node 6**: Checks if the EQ-5D-5L index score is greater than 0.5.
8. **Node 7**: Checks if the SF36 mental summary score is less than or equal to 40.

### Note:
- The thresholds and conditions on the features above are hypothetical. In a real-world scenario, you should derive these thresholds from data and domain knowledge.
- Adjust the feature importance and tree structure based on more accurate medical insights and statistical analysis on the dataset.
