Here is a Python function implementation based on your specifications and the provided feature set. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 3, with meaningful thresholds applied where possible.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the classification of the target variable ('x1': pain and disability outcome at 6 months)
    based on input features and returns the corresponding inner node truth values.

    Parameters:
    - X: dict, a dictionary containing feature values, with keys matching the given feature names.

    Returns:
    - prediction: int, the predicted class (0 = good, 1 = bad)
    - nodes: list of int, truth values of inner decision nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Create a placeholder list for inner nodes
  
    # Decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40.0  # Root node
    if nodes[0]:  # If "sf36_physical_summary" <= 40.0
        nodes[1] = X["ies_r_total"] >= 25.0
        if nodes[1]:  # IES-R total >= 25
            nodes[2] = X["bmi"] >= 30.0  # Check for obesity
            if nodes[2]:  # BMI >= 30
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
            else:  # BMI < 30
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
        else:  # IES-R total < 25
            nodes[2] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] >= 5.0  # Pain intensity average >= 5
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # good outcome
    else:  # sf36_physical_summary > 40.0
        nodes[1] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.8  # Check EQ-5D-5L index score
        if nodes[1]:  # EQ-5D-5L index score <= 0.8
            nodes[2] = X["penetrating_injury"] == 1  # Check for penetrating injury
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:  # EQ-5D-5L index score > 0.8
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
  
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Nodes**:  
   Each node in the decision tree corresponds to a condition applied to one feature:
   - `nodes[0]`: Root node checking if `"sf36_physical_summary"` (physical health summary) is below or equal to 40, which may indicate poor physical health.  
   - `nodes[1]`: Second-level condition dependent on `"ies_r_total"` (impact of traumatic stress) or `"eq5d_5l_index_score"` (general health index).  
   - `nodes[2]`: Third-level condition dependent on `"bmi"` (obesity), `"bl_cpgs_intensity_average"` (pain intensity), or `"penetrating_injury"`.  

2. **Thresholds**:
   - `sf36_physical_summary <= 40.0`: Indicates poor physical function and is used as the root split.
   - `ies_r_total >= 25.0`: A threshold indicating moderate to severe post-traumatic stress.
   - `bmi >= 30.0`: Obesity threshold.
   - `bl_cpgs_intensity_average >= 5.0`: A clinically meaningful pain intensity threshold.  
   - `eq5d_5l_index_score <= 0.8`: Indicates poor general health status.  
   - `penetrating_injury == 1`: Binary condition indicating the presence of a penetrating injury.  

3. **Prediction**:  
   Based on the nodes' truth values (`1` or `0`), the tree predicts:  
   - `1`: Bad outcome.  
   - `0`: Good outcome.
