Below is the Python function implementing a decision tree for predicting the **pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad)**. This function has a maximum depth of 3 and uses selected features from your dataset. It returns both the predicted class and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Python function

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma.
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features with the following keys:
            - 'age': Age in years
            - 'bmi': Body Mass Index (kg/m^2)
            - 'pen_injury': Penetrating injury (1 = yes, 0 = no)
            - 'pain_region_count': Pain region count
            - 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': Average pain intensity
            - 'hads_dep_score': HADS depression score
    
    Returns:
        int: Predicted outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad)
        list: Truth values of the inner nodes (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 3

    # Decision tree logic
    # Node 0: Pain region count
    nodes[0] = X["pain_region_count"] > 3
    if nodes[0]:  # More than 3 pain regions
        # Node 1: HADS depression score
        nodes[1] = X["hads_dep_score"] > 8
        if nodes[1]:  # HADS depression score greater than 8
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # HADS depression score <= 8
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Pain region count <= 3
        # Node 2: Average pain intensity
        nodes[2] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5
        if nodes[2]:  # Average pain intensity greater than 5
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Average pain intensity <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    # Return the predicted class and the list of inner node evaluations
    return prediction, nodes

### Explanation of the Decision Tree

1. **Root Node (Node 0)**:  
   The tree starts with **pain_region_count**. If the number of pain regions is greater than 3, it proceeds to the next node; otherwise, it branches differently. This feature is chosen because it reflects the physical extent of pain, which is likely correlated with disability outcomes.
   
2. **Node 1**:  
   For cases where **pain_region_count > 3**, we evaluate the **HADS depression score**. A score greater than 8 is associated with worse mental health, which can lead to worse outcomes (classification: 1). Otherwise, the outcome is more likely good (classification: 0).

3. **Node 2**:  
   For cases where **pain_region_count <= 3**, we evaluate **bl_cpgs_intensity_average** (average pain intensity). Higher pain intensity (> 5) leads to a worse outcome (classification: 1). Lower pain intensity (<= 5) indicates better outcomes (classification: 0).

### Example Usage

```python
# Example feature input
X_test = {
    "age": 35,
    "bmi": 28.7,
    "pen_injury": 1,
    "pain_region_count": 4,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6,
    "hads_dep_score": 10
}

# Get prediction and node evaluations
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (bad outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1, None] (corresponding to truth values for inner nodes)
```

### Assumptions

1. **Thresholds**:
   - `pain_region_count > 3`: Chosen based on the intuition that widespread pain is associated with poor outcomes.
   - `hads_dep_score > 8`: Common threshold for clinically significant depression symptoms.
   - `bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`: Pain intensity scale typically ranges from 0 to 10, with scores above 5 indicating moderate to severe pain.
   
2. Features not directly used (e.g., `age`, `bmi`) may still be relevant but are omitted to align with the goal of simplifying the tree to depth 3.

3. Feature engineering and real thresholds should ideally come from data analysis or clinical input.
