Here is the Python function formatted to use the example input and the structure provided in the example. This function predicts the outcome (`pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma`) and returns a truth value list corresponding to the inner node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Create a list to store the truth values for each inner node
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each decision node
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] >= 2  # Moderate or major injury severity
    nodes[1] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.6  # Poor quality of life
    nodes[2] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5  # High average pain intensity
    nodes[3] = X["bl_sleep_quality"] <= 4  # Poor sleep quality
    nodes[4] = X["hads_anx_score"] > 8  # High anxiety score

    # Traverse the decision tree to make a prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # iss_category >= 2
        if nodes[1]:  # eq5d_5l_index_score <= 0.6
            if nodes[2]:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
                if nodes[3]:  # bl_sleep_quality <= 4
                    if nodes[4]:  # hads_anx_score > 8
                        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:  # bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    # Return the prediction and truth values of the nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Conditions:**  
   - **`iss_category >= 2`**: Moderate or major injury severity likely increases the chance of a bad outcome.  
   - **`eq5d_5l_index_score <= 0.6`**: A low EQ-5D-5L index score indicates poor health-related quality of life, which contributes to a bad outcome.  
   - **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`**: High average pain intensity at baseline is an indicator of poor prognosis.  
   - **`bl_sleep_quality <= 4`**: Poor sleep quality can negatively affect recovery.  
   - **`hads_anx_score > 8`**: High anxiety, as measured by the HADS, is a risk factor for worse outcomes.  

2. **Output Format:**  
   - `prediction`: The predicted class (0 = good outcome, 1 = bad outcome).  
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values (0 or 1) indicating whether the condition of each inner node was satisfied.
