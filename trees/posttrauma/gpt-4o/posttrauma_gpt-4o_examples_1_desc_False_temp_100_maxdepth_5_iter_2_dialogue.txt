Below is a Python function that implements a depth-5 decision tree based on the provided features and target variable. The function takes an input dictionary, `X`, containing the feature values, and returns the predicted class (pain and disability outcome: 0 = good, 1 = bad) along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to track truth values through the decision tree (5 nodes)
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check EQ-5D-5L index score
    nodes[0] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.7
    
    # Node 1: Check number of fractures
    nodes[1] = X["nb_of_fractures"] > 2
    
    # Node 2: Check SF36v2 Mental Summary Score
    nodes[2] = X["sf36_mental_summary"] <= 45
    
    # Node 3: Check sleep quality since injury
    nodes[3] = X["bl_sleep_quality"] <= 2  # Assumes lower scores indicate poorer sleep quality
    
    # Node 4: Check Injury Severity Score (ISS Total)
    nodes[4] = X["iss_score"] > 15

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Node Splits

1. **Node 0: `eq5d_5l_index_score`**  
   - Threshold: ≤ 0.7  
   - Rationale: Lower EQ-5D-5L index scores indicate worse quality of life, which could correlate with a bad pain and disability outcome.

2. **Node 1: `nb_of_fractures`**  
   - Threshold: > 2  
   - Rationale: A higher number of fractures typically indicates more severe injury, which is predictive of worse outcomes.

3. **Node 2: `sf36_mental_summary`**  
   - Threshold: ≤ 45  
   - Rationale: Lower mental health scores (SF36v2) could indicate comorbid psychological stress, which might contribute to worse outcomes.

4. **Node 3: `bl_sleep_quality`**  
   - Threshold: ≤ 2  
   - Rationale: Poor sleep quality since injury is often associated with worse recovery outcomes.

5. **Node 4: `iss_score`**  
   - Threshold: > 15  
   - Rationale: A higher Injury Severity Score (ISS) indicates more severe trauma, which increases the likelihood of a worse outcome.

### Example Input and Output

**Input:**
```python
X = {
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.65,
    "nb_of_fractures": 3,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 40,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 1,
    "iss_score": 20,
}
```

**Output:**
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # 1 (bad outcome)
print(nodes)       # [True, True, True, True, True]
```

**Explanation:** This input satisfies all the conditions for a bad outcome: low EQ-5D-5L score, high number of fractures, low mental health score, poor sleep quality, and high ISS score.

**Input:**
```python
X = {
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.9,
    "nb_of_fractures": 1,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 4,
    "iss_score": 10,
}
```

**Output:**
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # 0 (good outcome)
print(nodes)       # [False, False, False, False, False]
```

**Explanation:** This input does not satisfy any of the conditions for a bad outcome, leading to a good outcome prediction.
