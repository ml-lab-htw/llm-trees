Sure, based on your request and the features provided, I'll write a Python function that simulates a decision tree to predict the outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma using some of the given features. The function will also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

<!--
Since I don't have exact information on which features are the most important, I will use the IKDC score and days from injury to baseline MRI again, as placeholders in this constructed example.
-->

Here is the Python function for your request:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40  # First decision node based on physical health summary
    nodes[1] = X["days_in_hospital"] <= 10  # Second decision node based on the days in hospital
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0
        else:
            prediction = 1

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:

    'remote_pressure_average': 30,
    'crp_test': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Decision Node**: Uses `sf36_physical_summary` to determine if the physical health summary score is less than or equal to 40. This is a plausible way to assess the physical condition, as worse conditions might lead to worse outcomes.
2. **Second Decision Node**: Uses `days_in_hospital` to determine if the patient stayed in the hospital for 10 days or less, as extended hospital stay may indicate severe trauma, potentially leading to worse outcomes.

### Example Usage
- The example `X` dictionary is filled with example values.
- The `predict` function returns a prediction and a list of nodes reflecting the decision paths taken.

Please replace these feature names and thresholds with actual values based upon your data and analysis if necessary.
