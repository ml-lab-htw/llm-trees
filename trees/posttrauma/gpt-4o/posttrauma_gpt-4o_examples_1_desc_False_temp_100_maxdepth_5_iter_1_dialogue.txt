Below is the Python function implementing a depth-5 decision tree that predicts the target "pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma" (`x1`) based on the specified features. This decision tree assigns a binary classification (`0 = good`, `1 = bad`) and also returns the list of truth values for the inner nodes of the tree.

### Python Code:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad) and provides a trace of truth values (1/0)
    at each decision node in a depth-5 decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of features with keys matching the provided feature set.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): 0 (good) or 1 (bad) as the outcome prediction.
        nodes (list): List of truth values (1 for condition met, 0 otherwise) at each decision node.
    """
    # Initialize list for truth values with 5 nodes
    nodes = [None] * 5

    # Node 0: Check if "bl_cpgs_intensity_average" (pain intensity average) is less than or equal to 5.0
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5.0

    if nodes[0]:  # Pain intensity average is low (≤ 5.0)
        # Node 1: Check if "ies_r_total" (IES-R total) is less than or equal to 25
        nodes[1] = X["ies_r_total"] <= 25

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 0:**  
   The root of the tree checks if `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (average pain intensity) is low (≤ 5.0).  
   - If *true* (pain is manageable), the tree explores further psychological and work-related factors.  
   - If *false* (pain is high), the tree considers physical health, fractures, and sleep quality.

2. **Node 1:**  
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` is low, it evaluates recovery stress through `ies_r_total` (a measure of post-traumatic stress).  
   - If `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` is high, it evaluates fracture severity (`nb_of_fractures`).

3. **Node 2:**  
   - For low pain intensity, anxiety level (`hads_anx_score`) is checked.  
   - For high pain intensity, physical health (`sf36_physical_summary`) is checked.

4. **Node 3:**  
   - For low pain and low anxiety, work status (`working_at_baseline`) is checked.  
   - For high pain and fewer fractures, sleep quality (`bl_sleep_quality`) is considered.

5. **Node 4:**  
   - The final check for low pain, low anxiety, and working patients is whether the patient is young (`age` ≤ 40).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example feature dictionary
X_test = {
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 4.5,
    "ies_r_total": 20,
    "hads_anx_score": 6,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "age": 35,
    "nb_of_fractures": 0,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 45,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 4
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)

# Output
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

### Notes:
1. **Truth Values (`nodes`):**  
   Each `nodes[i]` corresponds to whether the condition of the `i-th` decision node was satisfied or not in the tree.

2. **Thresholds and Features:**  
   The thresholds and features were chosen based on typical values found in medical research for pain intensity, mental health, and recovery.

3. **Customization:**  
   You can tailor thresholds and features based on domain-specific knowledge or dataset-specific statistics.
