To construct a decision tree function that classifies pain and disability outcomes at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma, we need to consider important features and determine meaningful thresholds based on the problem context. 

Hereâ€™s the Python function for prediction and node truth values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check baseline mean cartilage thickness
    nodes[0] = X['eq5d_5l_index_score'] <= 0.6    
    # Node 1: Check baseline mean T2 values for deep cartilage layers
    nodes[1] = X['sf36_physical_summary'] <= 45
    # Node 2: Check external peak knee moment around z-axis
    nodes[2] = X['hads_dep_score'] <= 7 
    # Node 3: Check baseline mean T2 values for superficial cartilage layers
    nodes[3] = X['sf36_physical_summary'] > 35
    # Node 4: Check Lysholm score
    nodes[4] = X['pseq_total'] <= 40
    # Node 5: Check Tegner score
    nodes[5] = X['pain_region_count'] <= 5
  
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0 (`eq5d_5l_index_score`):** If the EQ-5D-5L index score is less than or equal to 0.6, it could indicate worse health-related quality of life, making it an important node.
- **Node 1 (`sf36_physical_summary`):** A lower SF-36 physical summary score (<= 45) indicates poorer physical functioning.
- **Node 2 (`hads_dep_score`):** A HADS depression score of 7 or less indicates lower depression levels.
- **Node 3 (`sf36_physical_summary`):** A physical summary score above 35 indicates better physical status.
- **Node 4 (`pseq_total`):** A PSEQ total score of 40 or less indicates lower pain self-efficacy.
- **Node 5 (`pain_region_count`):** A count of 5 or less indicates less widespread pain.

The function returns the prediction (0 for good outcome, 1 for bad) and the list of truth values for the nodes. This example demonstrates how we can map decision tree logic directly into a Python function. It's crucial to note that actual thresholds and decisions should be derived from analyzing the data comprehensively.
