Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and it uses meaningful thresholds for the splits based on the feature descriptions and domain knowledge.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    (0 = good, 1 = bad) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the pain intensity (average) is less than or equal to 5.5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5.5
    
    # Node 1: Check if the SF36 physical summary score is greater than 40.0
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 40.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If pain intensity (average) <= 5.5
        if nodes[1]:  # If SF36 physical summary > 40.0
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # If SF36 physical summary <= 40.0
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # If pain intensity (average) > 5.5
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (pain intensity, average). If the average pain intensity is less than or equal to 5.5, the tree proceeds to the next split. Otherwise, it predicts a **bad outcome (1)** because higher pain intensity is associated with worse outcomes.
2. **Node 1**: If the average pain intensity is less than or equal to 5.5, the next split is based on the `sf36_physical_summary` (SF36v2 physical summary score). If the physical summary score is greater than 40.0, it predicts a **good outcome (0)** because higher physical function scores are associated with better outcomes. Otherwise, it predicts a **bad outcome (1)**.

    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 6.0,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 2.0,
    "pain_region_count": 3,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 20,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 12,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 3,
    "local_heat_average": 40,
    "remote_heat_average": 42,
    "local_cold_average": 15,
    "remote_cold_average": 16,
    "local_pressure_average": 300,
    "remote_pressure_average": 320,
    "crp_test": 5.0
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Good outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` = 4.0, which is â‰¤ 5.5, so `nodes[0] = True`.
- `sf36_physical_summary` = 45, which is > 40.0, so `nodes[1] = True`.
- Since both conditions are satisfied, the prediction is **0 (Good outcome)**.
