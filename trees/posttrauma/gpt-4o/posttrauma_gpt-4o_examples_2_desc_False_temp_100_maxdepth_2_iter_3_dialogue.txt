Based on the features and target variable provided, I will translate the earlier decision tree into a Python function that returns a prediction and a list of truth values representing the conditions of the inner nodes.

Here's the updated decision tree in the form of a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store the truth values for each node

    # Node 0: Check the IKDC score
    nodes[0] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.7  # Assuming 'IKDC score' correlates with 'EQ-5D-5L' because both are overall health scores
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If IKDC score <= 70
        # Node 1: Check the days from injury to baseline MRI
        nodes[1] = X["days_in_hospital"] <= 180  # Assuming 'days from injury to baseline MRI' can loosely correlate with 'days in hospital'
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # classification: abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # classification: normal

    else:  # If IKDC score > 70
        # Node 1: Check the baseline mean cartilage thickness in central medial femur
        nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 2.5  # Assuming 'mean cartilage thickness' can correlate with 'pain intensity'
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # classification: abnormal
        else:
            prediction = 0  # classification: normal

    return prediction, nodes
```

In this function:
- `nodes[0]` checks if the `eq5d_5l_index_score` (as a proxy for IKDC score) is less than or equal to 70.
- `nodes[1]` checks if `days_in_hospital` (as a proxy for days from injury to baseline MRI) is less than or equal to 180 if the first condition is true. If the first condition is false, it then checks if `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (as a proxy for baseline mean cartilage thickness) is less than or equal to 2.5.

Note: The thresholds and feature mappings are hypothetical and are based on the assumption that similar health and injury-related metrics can be used hierarchically. It is important to have actual data to fine-tune these thresholds and validate the feature mappings properly.
