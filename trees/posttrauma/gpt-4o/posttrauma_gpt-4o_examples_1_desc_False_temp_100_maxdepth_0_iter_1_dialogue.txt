Based on the decision tree induction process and the feature set you have provided, let's create a decision tree classifier to predict **pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma** (`x1: 0 = good, 1 = bad`).

### Feature Selection Rationale:
1. **iss_category**: Injury severity score category is important because more severe injuries are likely to lead to worse long-term outcomes.
2. **sf36_physical_summary**: Physical health status as measured by SF36 is an important predictor of recovery in musculoskeletal trauma, and lower scores are likely associated with worse outcomes.
  
Given the request for a maximum tree depth of 2, I will build a decision tree using these two features.

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Root Node: Injury severity score category
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] >= 3  # Major injury (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = major)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome due to major trauma
    else:
        # Second Node: SF36 physical summary score
        nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40  # Low physical health score
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome due to low physical health score
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome for moderate/mild injury and better physical health
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Root Node**: The first decision is made based on the **injury severity score category** (`iss_category`). If the injury is classified as **major** (`iss_category >= 3`), the prediction is **bad outcome** (1), as more severe injuries tend to result in worse recovery outcomes.
   
2. **Second Node**: For injuries classified as **moderate or mild** (`iss_category < 3`), the decision is further refined based on the **SF36 physical summary score** (`sf36_physical_summary`). If the score is **low** (â‰¤ 40), we predict a **bad outcome** (1), as lower physical health is associated with poorer recovery. If the score is higher, we predict a **good outcome** (0).

### Notes:
- The thresholds for **iss_category** and **sf36_physical_summary** are chosen based on domain knowledge where more severe injuries and low physical health scores are typically associated with worse outcomes.
- The `nodes` list records the truth values of each condition (inner node) in the decision tree, where `1` means the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
