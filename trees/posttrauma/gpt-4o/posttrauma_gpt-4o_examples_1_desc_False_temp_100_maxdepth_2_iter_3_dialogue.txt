Here’s the Python function for a decision tree based on your feature set. I am selecting relevant features and thresholds that align with the domain, and ensuring the function adheres to the requested format.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree classifier for predicting pain and disability outcome at 6 months
    following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad).
    
    Input:
    - X (dict): Feature dictionary including all keys described
    
    Output:
    - prediction (int): Predicted class (0 = good, 1 = bad)
    - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """
    # Initialize a list for the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Decision tree logic based on feature thresholds
    # Node 1: Check if the injury severity score is mild or moderate
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] <= 2  # 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = major

    if nodes[0]:  # If injury severity is mild or moderate
        # Node 2: Check if the pain intensity (average) is low
        nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 4.0  # Scale typically ranges 0-10
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome (low pain)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (high pain)
    else:  # If injury severity is major
        # Node 2: Check if the number of fractures is low
        nodes[1] = X["nb_of_fractures"] <= 1  # 0 or 1 fracture considered lower severity
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (major injury but fewer fractures)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (major injury with more fractures)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Tree:
1. **Node 1 (Root Node)**: The decision tree first checks the injury severity score category (`iss_category`).
   - Patients with mild or moderate injuries (categories 1 or 2) may have a better chance of recovery compared to those with major injuries (category 3).
2. **Node 2 (Left Branch)**: For patients with mild/moderate injuries, it checks the average pain intensity (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`).
   - A threshold of 4.0 is chosen, as pain levels below this are often considered mild or tolerable, and may correlate with a "good" outcome.
3. **Node 2 (Right Branch)**: For patients with major injuries, it checks the number of fractures (`nb_of_fractures`).
   - The logic assumes that a higher number of fractures increases the likelihood of a "bad" outcome.

### Usage Example:
Here’s how you can use the function with a sample input:

```python

    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 7,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 4,
    "local_heat_average": 45.0,
    "remote_heat_average": 47.0,
    "local_cold_average": 15.0,
    "remote_cold_average": 12.0,
    "local_pressure_average": 200.0,
    "remote_pressure_average": 180.0,
    "crp_test": 5.0
}

# Get the prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 0 = good, 1 = bad
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Truth values of the inner nodes
```

This function presents a simple interpretable decision tree based on the described features and thresholds. You can adjust the feature thresholds further based on actual data or domain-specific knowledge, as necessary.
