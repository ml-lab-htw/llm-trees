Here is the Python function implementing a decision tree with depth 3 for the given problem. It predicts whether the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma is "good (0)" or "bad (1)" based on the features provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of node truth values
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] <= 15               # Root node: Injury severity score (mild/moderate)
    nodes[1] = X["age"] <= 50                     # Internal node 1: Age threshold
    nodes[2] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5.5  # Internal node 2: Average pain intensity baseline

    # Prediction logic
    if nodes[0]:  # ISS score ≤ 15
        if nodes[1]:  # Age ≤ 50
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Age > 50
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # ISS score > 15
        if nodes[2]:  # Pain intensity > 5.5
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Pain intensity ≤ 5.5
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **`iss_score` (Injury Severity Score)**:
   - Threshold: `15`
   - Rationale: Lower ISS scores (≤ 15) are associated with less severe injuries, which are more likely to lead to good outcomes. Higher scores (> 15) represent more severe injuries and correlate with higher risk of bad outcomes.

2. **`age`**:
   - Threshold: `50 years`
   - Rationale: Younger individuals (≤ 50 years) typically recover better from musculoskeletal injuries, while older individuals (> 50 years) may face challenges in recovery due to age-related factors.

3. **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (Baseline pain intensity average)**:
   - Threshold: `5.5`
   - Rationale: Higher baseline pain intensity (> 5.5) is associated with worse recovery outcomes, making it a critical factor in determining whether a patient will experience a bad outcome.

### Inputs and Outputs:
1. **Input**:  
   A dictionary `X` containing the following keys:  
   - `"iss_score"`: Total injury severity score (integer)
   - `"age"`: Age of the individual (integer)
   - `"bl_cpgs_intensity_average"`: Average pain intensity at baseline (float)

   Example Input:
   ```python
   X = {
       "iss_score": 10,
       "age": 45,
       "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6.0
   }
   ```

2. **Output**:
   - **`prediction`** (integer): `0` for good outcome, `1` for bad outcome.
   - **`nodes`** (list of integers): Truth values (`1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the 3 inner nodes.

   Example Output:
   ```python
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print(prediction)  # Output: 1
   print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True, True]
   ```

### Testing the Function:
Here are test cases to validate the function:
```python
# Test case 1: Good outcome
X1 = {
    "iss_score": 10,
    "age": 45,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 4.0
}
print(predict(X1))  # Output: (0, [True, True, False])

# Test case 2: Bad outcome due to age
X2 = {
    "iss_score": 10,
    "age": 55,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 4.0
}
print(predict(X2))  # Output: (1, [True, False, False])

# Test case 3: Bad outcome due to high pain intensity
X3 = {
    "iss_score": 20,
    "age": 45,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 6.0
}
print(predict(X3))  # Output: (1, [False, True, True])
```

This function can be customized further by tuning the thresholds or implementing variations in the decision tree structure. These adjustments can be made based on domain-specific data or expert insights.
