Here is the Python implementation of a decision tree with depth 1 for predicting the given target variable (`x1: pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad)`):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma (0 = good, 1 = bad).

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values. The keys of this dictionary must match the 
                  exact spelling of the feature names provided.

    Returns:
        prediction (int): The predicted outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad).
        nodes (list): A list representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
                      1 indicates the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Create a list for storing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    
    # Decision Tree: Splitting on the critical feature 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average' (average pain intensity at baseline).
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5.0  # Threshold chosen based on intuition or prior knowledge.
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes

### Explanation
1. **Feature Selection**:
   - The decision tree uses the feature `'bl_cpgs_intensity_average'` (average pain intensity at baseline) as it is directly related to the target variable (`pain and disability outcome`).
   - The threshold value of `5.0` was chosen based on a hypothetical domain-specific understanding or prior research that higher average pain intensity correlates with worse outcomes.

2. **Tree Structure**:
   - **Inner node**: `bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5.0`. If true, the prediction is `1` (bad outcome). If false, the prediction is `0` (good outcome).

3. **Outputs**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad).
   - `nodes`: A list representing the truth value of the condition at the inner node. Here, `[1]` means the condition `bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5.0` was satisfied, while `[0]` means it was not.

You can adapt or refine this model further if you have more precise knowledge of the data or alternative thresholds/features.
