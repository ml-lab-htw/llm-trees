Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and the thresholds are chosen based on logical reasoning and domain knowledge. If you have access to actual data, these thresholds can be refined further.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    (0 = good, 1 = bad) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 or 1) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the pain intensity (average) is less than or equal to 5
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5
    
    # Node 1: Check if the SF36v2 physical summary is greater than 40
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 40
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If pain intensity (average) <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # If SF36v2 physical summary > 40
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # If SF36v2 physical summary <= 40
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # If pain intensity (average) > 5
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on the feature `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (pain intensity, average). A threshold of 5 is chosen as a hypothetical cutoff. If the pain intensity is less than or equal to 5, the tree proceeds to the next node. Otherwise, it predicts a "bad" outcome (1).
2. **Node 1**: The second split is based on the feature `sf36_physical_summary` (SF36v2 physical summary). A threshold of 40 is chosen as a hypothetical cutoff. If the physical summary score is greater than 40, the tree predicts a "good" outcome (0). Otherwise, it predicts a "bad" outcome (1).

### Example Usage:

    "age": 35,
    "bmi": 25.4,
    "gender_birth": 1,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 3,

    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.8,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 70,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 45,
    "hads_anx_score": 5,
    "hads_dep_score": 4,
    "tsk_11_total": 20,
    "pseq_total": 40,
    "ies_r_total": 30,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 10,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 10,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 10,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 4,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 3,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 7,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 2,
    "pain_region_count": 3,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 20,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 12,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 3,
    "local_heat_average": 45,
    "remote_heat_average": 50,
    "local_cold_average": 15,
    "remote_cold_average": 20,
    "local_pressure_average": 300,
    "remote_pressure_average": 250,
    "crp_test": 5
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Good outcome)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

### Output:
For the example input:
- **Prediction**: `0` (Good outcome)
- **Nodes**: `[True, True]` (Both conditions are satisfied)

This function is simple, interpretable, and adheres to the maximum depth of 2. If you have access to actual data, you can refine the thresholds and feature selection further.
