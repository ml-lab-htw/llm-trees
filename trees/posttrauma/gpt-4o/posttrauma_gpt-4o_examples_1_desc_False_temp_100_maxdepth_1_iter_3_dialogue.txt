Here's how we can create a Python function implementing a decision tree of depth 1 for the problem described. 

---

### Explanation:
1. We will select a meaningful feature from the provided list of features, attempting to ensure that it is domain-relevant and some threshold can be hypothesized.
2. Let's assume that **"bl_cpgs_intensity_average"** (average pain intensity at baseline) is the most important feature based on its direct link to pain and disability outcomes.
3. We will choose a **threshold of 5** (e.g., on a pain scale from 0 to 10) as a meaningful cutoff for deciding whether an individual will have a good or bad pain and disability outcome, where pain intensity ≤ 5 indicates "good" and > 5 indicates "bad."

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma
    (0 = good, 1 = bad) and returns the truth values for the decision tree's nodes.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): Input feature dictionary with keys matching the defined feature names.
    
    Returns:
    tuple:
        - prediction (int): Predicted class (0 = good, 1 = bad).
        - nodes (list): Truth values for inner nodes (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied).
    """
    nodes = [None]
    
    # Decision rule at depth 1 (node 0): Is baseline average pain intensity ≤ 5?
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5

    # Prediction based on the node condition
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input where baseline average pain intensity is provided
example_input = {
    "age": 30,
    "bmi": 25,
    "gender_birth": 2,
    "ethnic_group": 1,
    "education_age": 3,
    "working_at_baseline": 1,
    "smoker": 2,
    "days_in_hospital": 5,
    "iss_score": 9,
    "iss_category": 1,
    "nb_of_fractures": 2,
    "penetrating_injury": 0,
    "eq5d_5l_index_score": 0.75,
    "eq5d_5l_q6_i2": 80,
    "sf36_mental_summary": 50,
    "sf36_physical_summary": 45,
    "hads_anx_score": 7,
    "hads_dep_score": 5,
    "tsk_11_total": 20,
    "pseq_total": 35,
    "ies_r_total": 15,
    "ies_r_avoidance": 5,
    "ies_r_hyperarousal": 5,
    "ies_r_intrusion": 5,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 4.5,  # Average pain intensity
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_now": 6,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst": 8,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_least": 3,
    "pain_region_count": 4,
    "pe_total_percent_baseline": 35,
    "paindetect_grand_total": 20,
    "bl_sleep_24hrs": 6,
    "bl_sleep_quality": 3,
    "local_heat_average": 40,
    "remote_heat_average": 38,
    "local_cold_average": 10,
    "remote_cold_average": 12,
    "local_pressure_average": 400,
    "remote_pressure_average": 350,
    "crp_test": 3.0,
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Good, 1 = Bad)")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

---

### Example Output:
Given the example input where `bl_cpgs_intensity_average = 4.5`:

```
Prediction: 0 (0 = Good, 1 = Bad)
Nodes truth values: [1]
```

Here, the truth value of `1` indicates that the condition `bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5` is satisfied.

### Extending the Threshold:
If you have concrete data or results from analysis, you can adjust the feature and threshold accordingly. This example demonstrates a decision tree classifier limited to depth 1 effectively.
