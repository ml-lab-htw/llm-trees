### Explanation:
1. **First node**: The decision tree starts by checking the **injury severity score category** (`iss_category`). If the injury is classified as "major" (i.e., `iss_category >= 3`), the tree moves to the second node to evaluate the patient's physical health.
   
2. **Second node (if major injury)**: If the injury is major, the tree evaluates the **SF36 physical summary score** (`sf36_physical_summary`), which measures general physical health. A threshold of 40 is chosen as it generally corresponds to lower physical health. If the score is â‰¤ 40, the model predicts a **bad outcome** (pain and disability). Otherwise, it predicts a **good outcome**.

3. **Second node (if not major injury)**: If the injury is not classified as major, the tree examines the **current pain intensity** at baseline (`bl_cpgs_intensity_now`). If the pain intensity is greater than 5 (on a typical 0-10 pain scale), the model predicts a **bad outcome**. Otherwise, it predicts a **good outcome**.

Thus, the decision tree uses a combination of injury severity, physical health, and pain intensity to predict whether the patient will have a good or bad pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma.
