### Explanation:

1. **Node 1:** The first node checks the **"iss_category"** (Injury Severity Score category). If the injury severity is **moderate or less (≤ 2)**, we proceed to Node 2a. Otherwise, we go to Node 2b.
   
2. **Node 2a:** For patients with **moderate or less severe injuries**, the decision is based on their **average pain intensity (bl_cpgs_intensity_average)**. If their pain intensity is **≤ 5** (a lower level of pain), the outcome is predicted to be **good (0)**. Otherwise, the outcome is **bad (1)**.

3. **Node 2b:** If the injury is **more severe (iss_category > 2)**, the decision is based on the **number of fractures (nb_of_fractures)**. Patients with **1 or fewer fractures** are predicted to have a **good outcome (0)**, while those with **more than 1 fracture** are predicted to have a **bad outcome (1)**.

### Output:
- **`prediction`**: The predicted outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad).
- **`nodes`**: A list of truth values representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.

This structure ensures that the decision process follows the tree logic with a depth of 2, and the returned list `nodes` provides insight into which conditions were met during the prediction process.
