Based on the features and target variable provided, I'll create a decision tree focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the Python function implementing a depth-3 decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check pain intensity (worst)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.0
    
    # Node 1: Check PSEQ total score
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 35
    
    # Node 2: Check HADS depression score
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # Higher depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # Higher depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Worst pain intensity (threshold 7.0) as the primary split
2. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire total score (threshold 35) as the secondary split
3. HADS depression score (threshold 8) as the tertiary split

These features were chosen because:
- Initial pain intensity is a strong predictor of chronic pain development
- Pain self-efficacy is known to influence recovery outcomes
- Depression has been shown to affect pain outcomes and disability

The thresholds were selected based on clinical relevance:
- Pain intensity of 7/10 represents severe pain
- PSEQ score of 35 represents moderate pain self-efficacy
- HADS
