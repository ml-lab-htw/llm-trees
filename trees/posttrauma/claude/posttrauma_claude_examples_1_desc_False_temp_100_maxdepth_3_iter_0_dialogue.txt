Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function focusing on the most predictive features for pain and disability outcomes. I'll select features that are clinically relevant and have strong predictive value.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing binary decisions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 25
    nodes[1] = X["pain_region_count"] <= 3
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 10
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Low physical function
        if nodes[1]:  # Few pain regions
            if nodes[2]:  # Low depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # High depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Many pain regions
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher physical function
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree is based on:
1. SF-36 Physical Summary score as the primary split (physical function is a strong predictor of recovery)
2. Number of pain regions (widespread pain indicates complex cases)
3. HADS Depression score (psychological factors influence recovery)

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- SF-36 Physical Summary score of 25 represents significant physical limitation
- 3 pain regions as a threshold for widespread pain
- HADS Depression score of 10 is a common clinical cutoff for depression screening

This tree prioritizes a combination of physical function, pain distribution, and psychological factors, which are known to influence recovery after musculoskeletal trauma.
