Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check PSEQ total score (pain self-efficacy)
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] <= 35
    
    # Node 1: Check pain intensity (average)
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6
    
    # Node 2: Check HADS depression score
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low pain self-efficacy
        if nodes[1]:  # Moderate pain intensity
            if nodes[2]:  # Low depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # High depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # High pain intensity
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # High pain self-efficacy
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses three clinically relevant features:
1. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) total score - measures confidence in performing activities despite pain
2. Average pain intensity - direct measure of pain severity
3. HADS depression score - measures psychological state

The thresholds were chosen based on clinical significance:
- PSEQ â‰¤ 35 indicates lower pain self-efficacy
- Pain intensity > 6 indicates severe pain
- HADS depression score > 8 indicates possible depression

The tree first splits on pain self-efficacy as it's often a strong predictor of outcomes, then considers pain intensity and depression levels for further classification. High pain self-efficacy generally predicts good outcomes, while the combination of low self-efficacy, high pain intensity, and high depression scores predicts poor outcomes.
