Based on the provided features and target variable, here's a decision tree classifier function with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: PSEQ total score
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] > 40
    
    # Second decision node: SF36v2 physical summary score
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 35
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node splits on the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score. A higher PSEQ score indicates better self-efficacy in managing pain, which is associated with better outcomes. The threshold of 40 is chosen as it's often used as a clinically meaningful cutoff.

2. For patients with higher PSEQ scores (> 40), we then consider their SF36v2 physical summary score. The SF36v2 is a measure of health-related quality of life, with higher scores indicating better physical health. A threshold of 35 is chosen as it's approximately one standard deviation below the population norm, indicating significant physical health impairment.

3. Patients with both high PSEQ scores and relatively high SF36v2 physical summary scores are predicted to have a good outcome (0), while all others are predicted to have a bad outcome (1).

This decision tree focuses on two important predictors of pain and disability outcomes: pain self-efficacy and physical health status. It assumes that patients with better pain self-efficacy and physical health at baseline are more likely to have good outcomes at 6 months.

Note that the specific threshold values (40 for PSEQ and 35 for SF36v2 physical summary) are based on general clinical guidelines and may need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of your dataset.
