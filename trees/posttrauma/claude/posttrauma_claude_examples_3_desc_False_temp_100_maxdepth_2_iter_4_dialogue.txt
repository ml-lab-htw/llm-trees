Based on the provided features and target variable, here's a decision tree classifier function with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 35
    nodes[1] = X["pain_region_count"] <= 3
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses the SF-36 physical summary score, which is a measure of physical health-related quality of life. A score above 35 suggests better physical health.

2. For those with better physical health (SF-36 physical summary > 35), the number of pain regions is used as a secondary predictor. Having 3 or fewer pain regions is associated with a good outcome.

3. For those with poorer physical health (SF-36 physical summary <= 35), the HADS depression score is used as a secondary predictor. A score of 8 or below (indicating lower levels of depression) is associated with a good outcome.

This decision tree uses three important predictors of pain and disability outcomes:
1. Physical health status (SF-36 physical summary)
2. Pain extent (pain region count)
3. Mental health status (HADS depression score)

The thresholds chosen (35 for SF-36 physical summary, 3 for pain region count, and 8 for HADS depression score) are based on common clinical cutoffs or reasonable assumptions, but may need adjustment based on the specific dataset.

The function returns both the prediction (0 for good outcome, 1 for bad outcome) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes, as requested.
