Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier function focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check PSEQ total score (pain self-efficacy)
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] <= 30
    
    # Node 1: Check pain intensity (average)
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 7
    
    # Node 2: Check HADS depression score
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] > 11
    
    # Node 3: Check injury severity score
    nodes[3] = X["iss_score"] > 15

    if nodes[0]:  # Low pain self-efficacy
        if nodes[1]:  # High pain intensity
            if nodes[2]:  # High depression
                if nodes[3]:  # Severe injury
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  # Lower depression
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Lower pain intensity
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree focuses on key predictors that are known to influence pain and disability outcomes:
1. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) score - measuring confidence in performing activities despite pain
2. Average pain intensity - indicating baseline pain severity
3. HADS depression score - psychological factor known to influence pain outcomes
4. Injury Severity Score - objective measure of trauma
