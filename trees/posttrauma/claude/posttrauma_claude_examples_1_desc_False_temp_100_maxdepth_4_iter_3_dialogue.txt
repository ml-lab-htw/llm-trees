Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier function focused on predicting pain and disability outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad) with a maximum depth of 4. I'll select clinically relevant features and thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check pain intensity (worst)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.5
    
    # Node 1: Check PSEQ total (pain self-efficacy)
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 35
    
    # Node 2: Check HADS depression score
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    
    # Node 3: Check pain region count
    nodes[3] = X["pain_region_count"] <= 3

    if nodes[0]:  # Lower worst pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower depression
                if nodes[3]:  # Fewer pain regions
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:  # Higher depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher worst pain intensity
        if nodes[2]:  # Lower depression
            if nodes[3]:  # Fewer pain regions
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher depression
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Worst pain intensity (primary split)
2. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire score (measure of confidence in performing activities despite pain)
3. HADS depression score (psychological factor)
4. Pain region count (measure of pain spread)

The thresholds were chosen based on clinically meaningful values:
- 7.5 for worst pain intensity (
