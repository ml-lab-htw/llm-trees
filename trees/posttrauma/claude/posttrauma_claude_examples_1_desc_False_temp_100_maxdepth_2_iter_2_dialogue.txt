Based on clinically relevant features for pain and disability outcomes after musculoskeletal trauma, I'll create a decision tree focusing on pain intensity, psychological factors, and injury severity. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split on pain intensity (average), threshold based on typical clinical pain scale
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 7.0
    
    # Second split on psychological factor (HADS depression), threshold based on clinical cutoffs
    nodes[1] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 11
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower depression score
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Higher depression score
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Baseline average pain intensity (primary split) with a threshold of 7.0 (on a 0-10 scale)
2. HADS depression score (secondary split) with a threshold of 11 (clinical cutoff for moderate depression)

The logic follows that:
- Lower initial pain intensity + lower depression scores → good outcome
- Lower initial pain intensity + higher depression scores → bad outcome
- Higher initial pain intensity → bad outcome (regardless of depression score)

The thresholds are based on clinical relevance and common cutoff points in pain and psychological assessment.
