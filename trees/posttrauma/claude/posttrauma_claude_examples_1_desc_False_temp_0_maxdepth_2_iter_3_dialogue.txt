Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the Python function implementing a depth-2 decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split based on pain intensity (worst)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.5
    
    # Second split based on PSEQ total score
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 35
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Rationale for feature selection and thresholds:

1. First split: "bl_cpgs_intensity_worst" (worst pain intensity)
   - Threshold of 7.5 on a 0-10 scale
   - Pain intensity is a strong predictor of chronic pain development
   - Higher initial pain intensity typically associated with worse outcomes

2. Second split: "pseq_total" (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire)
   - Threshold of 35 (PSEQ ranges from 0-60)
   - Pain self-efficacy is a well-established predictor of pain outcomes
   - Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy and typically better outcomes

This tree structure considers both pain intensity and psychological factors (pain self-efficacy) which are known to influence recovery trajectories after musculoskeletal trauma.
