Based on the features and their descriptions, I'll create a decision tree focusing on key predictors of pain and disability outcomes. Here's the prediction function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check pain intensity (worst)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.0
    
    # Node 1: Check PSEQ total (pain self-efficacy)
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 30.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower worst pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher worst pain intensity
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Worst pain intensity (threshold 7.0 on a 0-10 scale)
2. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire total score (threshold 30.0 on a 0-60 scale)

The logic is:
- High initial pain intensity (>7.0) predicts bad outcomes
- Lower initial pain intensity (≤7.0) combined with low pain self-efficacy (≤30.0) predicts bad outcomes
- Lower initial pain intensity with higher pain self-efficacy predicts good outcomes

These thresholds are based on clinical relevance and common cutoff points in pain research.
