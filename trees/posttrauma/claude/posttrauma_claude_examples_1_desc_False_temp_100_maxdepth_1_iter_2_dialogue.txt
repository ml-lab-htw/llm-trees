Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree of depth 1 using the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score as the most important feature, as it's a strong predictor of pain-related outcomes. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] > 30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # good outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    return prediction, nodes
```

I chose PSEQ total score with a threshold of 30 because:
1. PSEQ is a validated measure of pain self-efficacy, scored from 0-60
2. Higher scores indicate greater confidence in performing activities despite pain
3. A score of 30 represents a moderate level of pain self-efficacy
4. Patients with higher pain self-efficacy (>30) are more likely to have better outcomes
5. This threshold has been used in previous research as a clinically meaningful cut-point

The function:
- Takes a dictionary of features as input
- Creates a list with one node (for depth 1)
- Checks if PSEQ total score is > 30
- Returns:
  - 0 (good outcome) if PSEQ > 30
  - 1 (bad outcome) if PSEQ â‰¤ 30
  - The list of node conditions (True/False)
