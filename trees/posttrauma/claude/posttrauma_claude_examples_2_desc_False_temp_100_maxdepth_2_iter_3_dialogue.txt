Based on the provided features and target variable, here's a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2, formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses the HADS depression score (`hads_dep_score`) as the primary split. A score of 8 or below is often used as a cutoff for normal levels of depression symptoms.

2. For patients with lower depression scores (<=8), we then look at their average pain intensity (`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`). A threshold of 6 is used, which is in the moderate to severe pain range on a 0-10 scale.

3. Patients with lower depression scores and lower average pain intensity are predicted to have a good outcome (0), while those with higher pain intensity despite lower depression scores are predicted to have a bad outcome (1).

4. Patients with higher depression scores (>8) are directly predicted to have a bad outcome (1), regardless of their pain intensity.

This tree considers both psychological (depression) and physical (pain intensity) factors, which are likely to influence pain and disability outcomes following musculoskeletal trauma. The HADS depression score is used as the primary split because psychological factors often have a significant impact on pain outcomes. The average pain intensity is used as a secondary split because it's a direct measure of the patient's current pain experience.

Please note that this is a simplified model, and actual clinical decision-making would require more comprehensive analysis and validation. The thresholds chosen (8 for HADS depression and 6 for average pain intensity) are based on common clinical interpretations, but may need to be adjusted based on specific population characteristics or clinical guidelines.
