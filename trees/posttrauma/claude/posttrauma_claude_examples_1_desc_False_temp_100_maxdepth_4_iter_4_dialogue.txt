Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts pain and disability outcomes, focusing on clinically relevant features. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Pain intensity as primary predictor
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.0
    
    # Node 1: Physical function/disability
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 25.0
    
    # Node 2: Psychological factors
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 11.0
    
    # Node 3: Pain sensitivity
    nodes[3] = X["local_pressure_average"] <= 250.0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Lower pain intensity branch
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
        # Higher pain intensity branch
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree considers:
1. Worst pain intensity as the primary split (higher pain suggesting worse outcomes)
2. Physical function from SF-36 (lower scores indicating more disability)
3. Depression score from HADS (higher scores indicating more psychological distress)
4. Local pressure pain sensitivity (lower thresholds indicating central sensitization)

The thresholds were selected based on clinical relevance:
- Pain intensity: 7/10 as a clinically significant pain level
- SF-36 Physical: 25 as a significant functional limitation
- HADS Depression: 11 as the cutoff for probable depression
- Pressure pain: 250 kPa as a clinically relevant threshold
