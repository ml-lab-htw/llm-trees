Based on the features and target variable provided, I'll create a decision tree focusing on the most predictive features for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the decision tree
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["pain_region_count"] <= 3
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] > 40
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    nodes[3] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 30
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # pain_region_count <= 3
        if nodes[1]:  # pseq_total > 40
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:  # pseq_total <= 40
            if nodes[2]:  # hads_dep_score <= 8
                prediction = 0  # good outcome
            else:  # hads_dep_score > 8
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:  # pain_region_count > 3
        if nodes[3]:  # sf36_physical_summary > 30
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:  # sf36_physical_summary <= 30
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses the following key features:
1. pain_region_count: Number of pain regions (primary split)
2. pseq_total: Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire score
3. hads_dep_score: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression score
4. sf36_physical_summary: SF36v2 physical summary score

The tree structure is based on clinical knowledge where:
- Lower number of pain regions typically indicates better outcomes
- Higher pain self-efficacy (PSEQ) scores indicate better pain coping
- Lower depression scores (HADS) suggest better mental health
- Higher physical function (SF36) suggests better physical health

The thresholds were chosen based on typical clinical cutoffs and the nature of
