def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] == 3  # ISS Category: Major
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 7  # Average Pain Intensity > 7
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] > 10  # HADS Depression Score > 10


    if nodes[0]:  # Major Injury
        if nodes[1]:  # High average pain
            prediction = 1  # Bad Outcome
        else:  # Manageable pain
            if nodes[2]:  # High depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad Outcome
            else:  # Low depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    elif X["iss_category"] == 2: # Moderate Injury
        if nodes[1]: #High average pain (using same threshold as major, could be adjusted)
            prediction = 1 # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Good outcome
    else: # Mild Injury (ISS Category 1)
        prediction = 0 # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`iss_category == 3`:** This checks if the injury severity score category is "Major."  This is a direct translation of the original logic.
* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 7`:**  This uses a threshold of 7 for average pain intensity. On a 0-10 scale, this represents moderately high pain.  This threshold could be adjusted based on clinical insights or data analysis.
* **`hads_dep_score > 10`:** A HADS depression score above 10 is often considered indicative of clinically significant depression.  This threshold aligns with common interpretations of the HADS scale.

**Improvements over the initial textual representation:**

* **Correct Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided in your prompt, avoiding errors.
* **Encoding Alignment:**  Uses the specified encoding for the target variable (0 for good, 1 for bad) and the ISS categories.
* **Handles Moderate and Mild Injuries:**  Explicitly includes conditions for moderate and mild injury categories, providing a complete prediction path for all possible input values of ISS categories.
* **Reasonable Thresholds:** Incorporates plausible thresholds based on the provided information and general clinical knowledge.  These thresholds can be refined with actual data.
* **Pythonic Code:**  Presents the logic in a clear and functional Python format.


This function fulfills the requirements of returning both a prediction and a list of node truth values. It's crucial to remember that without real data, this is still a hypothetical example and the chosen thresholds might not be optimal.  To create a truly effective decision tree, providing data is essential.
