Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier function with a maximum depth of 2 to predict the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node: PSEQ total score
    nodes[0] = X['pseq_total'] <= 30
    
    # Left child: Pain intensity (average)
    nodes[1] = X['bl_cpgs_intensity_average'] <= 7
    
    # Right child: SF36v2 physical score
    nodes[2] = X['sf36_physical_summary'] <= 35
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score. A lower score (≤ 30) indicates less confidence in performing activities despite pain, which might lead to worse outcomes.

2. For patients with lower PSEQ scores, we then look at the average pain intensity. If it's relatively low (≤ 7), we predict a good outcome; otherwise, we predict a bad outcome.

3. For patients with higher PSEQ scores, we look at the SF36v2 physical summary score. A lower score (≤ 35) indicates worse physical health, leading to a prediction of a bad outcome; otherwise, we predict a good outcome.

This decision tree uses important clinical features that are likely to influence pain and disability outcomes:

- PSEQ total: Measures pain self-efficacy, which is crucial for recovery.
- Average pain intensity: Directly relates to the patient's pain experience.
- SF36v2 physical summary: Provides an overall measure of physical health status.
