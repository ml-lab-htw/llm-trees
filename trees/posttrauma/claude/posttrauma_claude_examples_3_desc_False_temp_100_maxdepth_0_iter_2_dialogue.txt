**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on general clinical understanding.  For example, an EQ-5D VAS score above 70 is generally considered good.  An average pain score below 4 is also relatively low. However, these are just estimates and would need to be optimized with real data.
* **ISS Category Handling:** The original sketch had separate branches for mild, moderate, and major. This version uses numerical comparisons (`<= 1.5`, `<= 2.5`) to handle the categories more efficiently. This assumes the `iss_category` feature is encoded as 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=major as you specified.
* **Anxiety and Pain:**  For moderate injuries, the tree now considers both anxiety and average pain intensity. This reflects the complex interplay of physical and psychological factors.
* **Major Injuries:**  The tree currently predicts a bad outcome for all major injuries. This is a simplification.  With sufficient data, you might find subgroups within the major injury category that have better or worse outcomes based on other factors.
* **Missing Features:** This function uses a small subset of the available features.  With data, you can identify and incorporate other important predictors.

**How to Use:**

You can call the `predict` function with a dictionary representing a single patient's data:

```python
example_patient = {
    'iss_category': 2,
    'eq5d_5l_q6_i2': 60,
    'nb_of_fractures': 1,
    'hads_anx_score': 10,
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 6,
    # ... other features ... (though not used in this simplified tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (bad outcome)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, True, False]
```


This will return the predicted outcome (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values. Remember, this tree is still hypothetical.  Its performance will depend heavily on the quality and characteristics of the data used to train a real decision tree model.
