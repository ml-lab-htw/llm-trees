Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the Python function implementing a depth-2 decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: PSEQ total score (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire)
    # Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy, using 30 as threshold
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] > 30
    
    # Second split: SF36 physical summary score
    # Higher scores indicate better physical health, using 35 as threshold
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 35
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. PSEQ total score as the primary split because pain self-efficacy is a strong predictor of pain-related outcomes
2. SF36 physical summary score as the secondary split because physical health status is directly related to recovery potential

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- PSEQ: 30 is a clinically meaningful cutoff point
- SF36 physical summary: 35 represents significant physical limitation

The tree predicts a good outcome (0) only when both pain self-efficacy and physical health are above their respective thresholds, reflecting that better initial psychological and physical status are associated with better outcomes.
