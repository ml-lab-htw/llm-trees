Based on the provided features and target variable (pain and disability outcome), I'll create a clinically meaningful decision tree focusing on key predictors. Here's the prediction function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Key predictors for poor outcome: pain intensity, psychological factors, 
    # injury severity, and functional status
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.0
    nodes[1] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 11.0
    nodes[2] = X["iss_score"] <= 15.0
    nodes[3] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 30.0

    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower depression
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Higher depression
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower injury severity
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # Higher injury severity
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        if nodes[3]:  # Lower physical function
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher physical function
            if nodes[1]:  # Lower depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # Higher depression
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Worst pain intensity (threshold 7.0 on 0-10 scale)
2. Depression score (threshold 11.0, clinical cutoff for moderate depression)
3. Injury Severity Score (threshold 15.0, cutoff between moderate/severe)
4. SF-36 Physical Summary (threshold 30.0, indicating significant physical limitation)

The thresholds are based on clinically meaningful values from literature and standard clinical practice.
