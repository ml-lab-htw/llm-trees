Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcome. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: PSEQ total (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire)
    # Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy (range 0-60)
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] <= 32
    
    # Second split: Pain intensity (average)
    # Higher scores indicate more pain (range 0-10)
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low self-efficacy
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher self-efficacy
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain intensity
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Higher pain intensity
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

Rationale for feature selection and thresholds:

1. First split uses PSEQ total score because:
   - Pain self-efficacy is a strong predictor of pain-related outcomes
   - Threshold of 32 represents moderate self-efficacy
   
2. Second split uses average pain intensity because:
   - Baseline pain intensity is a well-established predictor of chronic pain
   - Threshold of 6.5 represents moderate-to-severe pain

This tree combines psychological (self-efficacy) and clinical (pain intensity) factors, which are known to be important predictors of pain-related outcomes. The structure prioritizes self-efficacy as the primary split, reflecting its importance in pain recovery.
