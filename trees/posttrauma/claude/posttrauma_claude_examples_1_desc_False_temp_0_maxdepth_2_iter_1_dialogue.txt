Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier focusing on the most relevant predictors for pain and disability outcomes. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split based on PSEQ total (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire)
    # Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy (range 0-60)
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] <= 30
    
    # Second split based on pain intensity (average)
    # Higher scores indicate worse pain (range 0-10)
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Low self-efficacy
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher self-efficacy
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain intensity
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Higher pain intensity
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

Rationale for feature selection and thresholds:

1. First split uses PSEQ total score (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire):
   - This is a well-validated measure of pain-related self-efficacy
   - Threshold of 30 (mid-range) separates those with low vs. moderate-to-high self-efficacy
   - Low self-efficacy is a known risk factor for poor outcomes

2. Second split uses average pain intensity:
   - Direct measure of pain severity
   - Threshold of 6 represents moderate-to-severe pain
   - Higher pain intensity at baseline is associated with worse outcomes

This tree structure prioritizes psychological (self-efficacy) and pain-related factors, which are strong predictors of chronic pain outcomes following trauma.
