Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree with a depth of 1 focusing on what seems to be the most predictive feature for pain and disability outcomes. Given the clinical context, I'll use the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score as it's a strong predictor of pain outcomes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # PSEQ ranges from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy
    # A cutoff of 30 is often clinically meaningful
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] > 30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # good outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # bad outcome
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

Rationale:
- The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) is chosen as the primary splitting feature because:
  1. It measures a person's confidence in performing activities despite pain
  2. Lower PSEQ scores (≤30) are associated with poorer outcomes in pain conditions
  3. It's a well-validated predictor of recovery in trauma patients
  4. The threshold of 30 is a clinically meaningful cutoff point based on previous research

This creates a simple decision rule:
- If PSEQ > 30 (higher self-efficacy) → predict good outcome (0)
- If PSEQ ≤ 30 (lower self-efficacy) → predict bad outcome (1)
