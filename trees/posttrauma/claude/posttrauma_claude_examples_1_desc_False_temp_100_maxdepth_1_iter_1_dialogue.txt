Based on the features and target variable provided, I'll create a decision tree classifier focusing on features that are likely to be most predictive of pain and disability outcomes. Given the clinical context, I'll use the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score as the primary splitting criterion, as it's a well-established predictor of pain outcomes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # PSEQ total score <= 30 indicates low pain self-efficacy
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] <= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 0  # good outcome
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses the PSEQ total score with a threshold of 30, which is a clinically meaningful cutoff point:
- If PSEQ total score is ≤ 30 (low pain self-efficacy), predict bad outcome (1)
- If PSEQ total score is > 30 (moderate to high pain self-efficacy), predict good outcome (0)

The threshold of 30 was chosen because:
1. PSEQ scores range from 0-60
2. Scores ≤ 30 typically indicate low pain self-efficacy
3. Low pain self-efficacy is associated with poorer outcomes in pain conditions

This simple tree captures an important psychological factor in pain outcomes while maintaining interpretability and clinical relevance.
