Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function with a maximum depth of 2 to predict the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: PSEQ total score
    nodes[0] = X['pseq_total'] > 40
    
    # Second decision node: Pain intensity (average)
    nodes[1] = X['bl_cpgs_intensity_average'] <= 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score. Higher scores on this questionnaire indicate better self-efficacy in managing pain, which is likely to be associated with better outcomes. We use a threshold of 40, which is a moderate to high score on this scale.

2. For those with higher PSEQ scores (>40), we then consider the average pain intensity. Lower pain intensity (<=5 on a 0-10 scale) is associated with a good outcome, while higher pain intensity is associated with a bad outcome.

3. Those with lower PSEQ scores (<=40) are predicted to have a bad outcome regardless of pain intensity, as low self-efficacy in managing pain is a strong predictor of poor outcomes.

This decision tree focuses on two important aspects of pain management: self-efficacy (PSEQ) and pain intensity. These factors are likely to be strong predictors of pain and disability outcomes following musculoskeletal trauma.

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for good outcome, 1 for bad outcome)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)

Note that the specific threshold values (40 for PSEQ and 5 for pain intensity) are based on general
