Based on the provided features and target variable, here's a Python function that implements a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 for predicting pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: PSEQ total score
    nodes[0] = X["pseq_total"] <= 40
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second decision node: Pain intensity (average)
        nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses the PSEQ (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) total score. This is a measure of a person's confidence in performing activities despite pain. A higher score indicates better self-efficacy.

2. If the PSEQ total score is low (<=40), we then look at the average pain intensity.

3. For those with low PSEQ scores, if their average pain intensity is also high (>6 on a 0-10 scale), we predict a bad outcome. Otherwise, we predict a good outcome.

4. If the PSEQ total score is high (>40), we directly predict a good outcome, as high pain self-efficacy is generally associated with better outcomes.

This decision tree considers both psychological factors (pain self-efficacy) and physical factors (pain intensity) in predicting outcomes. The PSEQ total score is chosen as the primary split because psychological factors often have a significant impact on pain and disability outcomes. The average pain intensity is used as a secondary split for those with lower self-efficacy, as higher pain levels are generally associated with worse outcomes.

The thresholds (40 for PSEQ and 6 for pain intensity) are chosen based on common clinical interpretations, but these could be adjusted based on specific population characteristics or clinical guidelines.
