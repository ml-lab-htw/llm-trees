Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts pain and disability outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad) using the most relevant clinical features. I'll focus on pain-related and psychological factors which are known to influence recovery outcomes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split based on pain intensity (average)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 7.0
    
    # Second split based on PSEQ total (pain self-efficacy)
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Average pain intensity as the primary split (threshold at 7.0 on a 0-10 scale)
2. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) total score as the secondary split (threshold at 30, with higher scores indicating better self-efficacy)

The logic behind this tree is:
- High initial pain intensity (>7.0) predicts poor outcome
- For lower initial pain intensity (≤7.0), the outcome depends on pain self-efficacy:
  - Higher self-efficacy (PSEQ >30) predicts good outcome
  - Lower self-efficacy (PSEQ ≤30) predicts poor outcome

These features were chosen because:
1. Initial pain intensity is a strong predictor of chronic pain development
2. Pain self-efficacy is a well-established psychological factor influencing recovery outcomes
