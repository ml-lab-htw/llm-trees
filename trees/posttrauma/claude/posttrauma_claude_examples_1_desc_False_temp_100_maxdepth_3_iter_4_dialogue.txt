Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that focuses on key predictors of poor pain and disability outcomes after musculoskeletal trauma. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Initial split on pain intensity
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.5
    
    # Node 1: Split on psychological factor
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 35.0
    
    # Node 2: Split on injury severity
    nodes[2] = X["iss_score"] <= 12.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower injury severity
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:  # Higher injury severity
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

Rationale for feature selection and thresholds:

1. `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst` (threshold 7.5):
   - Worst pain intensity is a strong predictor of chronic pain
   - Scale typically ranges 0-10, with 7.5 representing severe pain

2. `pseq_total` (threshold 35.0):
   - Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire measures confidence in performing activities despite pain
   - Scores range 0-60, with 35 representing moderate self-efficacy
   - Lower scores indicate higher risk of poor outcomes

3. `iss_score` (threshold 12.5):
   - Injury Severity Score indicates trauma severity
   - Scores range 1-75
   - 12.5 differentiates between mild/moderate and more severe injuries
