Based on the features and target variable provided, I'll create a decision tree function predicting pain and disability outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad) with meaningful thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Primary split on pain intensity (average)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6.5
    
    # Node 1: Secondary split on PSEQ total (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire)
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] <= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower average pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
    else:  # Higher average pain intensity
        prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Average pain intensity (threshold 6.5 on a 0-10 scale)
2. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire total score (threshold 30 on a 0-60 scale)

These thresholds are clinically meaningful:
- Pain intensity > 6.5 indicates severe pain
- PSEQ score â‰¤ 30 indicates low pain self-efficacy, which is associated with poor outcomes

The tree predicts worse outcomes (1) for patients with either high pain intensity or low pain self-efficacy, and better outcomes (0) for patients with lower pain intensity and higher pain self-efficacy.
