Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier function with a maximum depth of 2 to predict the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Root node
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Left child
        nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] > 35
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:
        # Right child
        nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 10
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses "bl_cpgs_intensity_average" (average pain intensity) as it's likely to be a strong predictor of future pain and disability outcomes. The threshold is set at 6.5 on a scale typically ranging from 0 to 10.

2. For lower pain intensity (<=6.5), we use "pseq_total" (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire total) as the second predictor. Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy in managing pain, so we set the threshold at 35 (the scale typically ranges from 0 to 60).

3. For higher pain intensity (>6.5), we use "hads_dep_score" (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression score) as the second predictor. Lower scores indicate less depression, so we set the threshold at 10 (the scale typically ranges from 0 to 21, with scores of 11 or higher indicating depression).

This tree structure takes into account both pain intensity and psychological factors (pain self-efficacy and depression) that could influence pain and disability outcomes. The specific threshold values are based on typical ranges for these scales and clinical significance, but they would need to be validated with actual data
