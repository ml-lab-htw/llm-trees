Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts pain and disability outcome (0 = good, 1 = bad) at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. I'll focus on clinically relevant features and use meaningful thresholds.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Pain intensity as primary split
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.0
    
    # Node 1: Physical function/disability
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 30.0
    
    # Node 2: Psychological factor
    nodes[2] = X["pseq_total"] <= 35.0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Poor physical function
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Better physical function
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        if nodes[2]:  # Low pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Worst pain intensity (threshold 7.0 on 0-10 scale) as the primary split
2. SF-36 Physical Summary score (threshold 30.0, where lower scores indicate worse function)
3. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire total score (threshold 35.0, where higher scores indicate better self-efficacy)

The thresholds are chosen based on clinical relevance:
- Pain intensity >7/10 is considered severe pain
- SF-36 Physical Summary score of 30 represents significant physical limitations
- PSEQ score of 35 represents moderate pain self-efficacy

This combination of physical and psychological factors is likely to predict pain and disability outcomes following trauma.
