Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree classifier function that predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X['hads_dep_score'] <= 8
    nodes[1] = X['pain_region_count'] <= 3
    nodes[2] = X['sf36_physical_summary'] > 30
    nodes[3] = X['age'] <= 45
    nodes[4] = X['iss_score'] <= 15

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # good outcome
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # bad outcome
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree focuses on the following key features:
1. HADS depression score
2. Pain region count
3. SF36v2 physical summary
4. Age
5. Injury severity score

The tree first splits on the HADS depression score, then considers factors like pain region count, physical health summary, age, and injury severity to classify the pain and disability outcome as good (0) or bad (1).

The function returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for good outcome, 1 for bad outcome) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that the thresholds used in this tree are based on general knowledge and assumptions about these measures. In a real-world scenario, these thresholds would be determined by the actual distribution of the data and the optimal splitting points found during the tree's training process.
