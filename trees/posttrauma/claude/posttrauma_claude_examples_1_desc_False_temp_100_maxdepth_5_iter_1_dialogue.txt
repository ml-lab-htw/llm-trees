Based on the provided features and target variable, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts pain and disability outcomes. I'll focus on clinically relevant features and thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Pain intensity as primary predictor
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_worst"] <= 7.5
    
    # Node 1: Pain self-efficacy
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] > 30
    
    # Node 2: Psychological factors
    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    
    # Node 3: Physical function
    nodes[3] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 25
    
    # Node 4: Pain sensitivity
    nodes[4] = X["local_pressure_average"] > 200

    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Higher self-efficacy
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Better physical function
                    prediction = 0  # Good outcome
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Lower self-efficacy
            if nodes[4]:  # Higher pressure pain threshold
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Higher self-efficacy
            if nodes[2]:  # Lower depression
                prediction = 0  # Good outcome
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First considers pain intensity (worst pain)
2. Then evaluates pain self-efficacy (PSEQ)
3. Considers psychological factors (HADS depression)
4. Evaluates physical function (SF-36)
5. Considers pain sensitivity (pressure pain threshold)

The thresholds
