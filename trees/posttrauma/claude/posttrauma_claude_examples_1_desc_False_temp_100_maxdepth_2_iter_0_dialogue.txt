Based on the features and their descriptions, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts poor pain and disability outcomes (0 = good, 1 = bad) using clinically relevant features and thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split based on pain intensity (average) - threshold at 7 out of 10
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 7
    
    # Second split based on PSEQ total (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire)
    # PSEQ ranges 0-60, higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy
    nodes[1] = X["pseq_total"] >= 30
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Lower pain intensity
        if nodes[1]:  # Higher pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:  # Lower pain self-efficacy
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Higher pain intensity
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree uses:
1. Average pain intensity (threshold of 7/10) as the primary split, as high baseline pain is a strong predictor of poor outcomes
2. Pain Self-Efficacy (PSEQ) as the secondary split, as higher self-efficacy is associated with better outcomes
3. The thresholds are based on clinically meaningful values: 7/10 for significant pain and 30/60 for moderate self-efficacy

The function returns both the prediction (0 = good outcome, 1 = bad outcome) and the list of node conditions (True/False values).
