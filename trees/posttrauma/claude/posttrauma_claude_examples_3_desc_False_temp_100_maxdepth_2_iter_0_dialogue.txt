Based on the provided information and the request for a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, I'll create a Python function that predicts the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["hads_dep_score"] <= 8
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] > 30
    nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 45

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the decision tree:

1. The root node uses the HADS depression score (hads_dep_score) as the primary split. A score of 8 or less is considered the threshold between normal and mild depression symptoms.

2. For patients with lower depression scores (<=8):
   - We then look at the SF-36 physical summary score (sf36_physical_summary). A score above 30 indicates better physical health status.
   - If the physical summary score is > 30, we predict a good outcome (0).
   - If the physical summary score is <= 30, we predict a bad outcome (1).

3. For patients with higher depression scores (>8):
   - We consider the patient's age. 45 years is chosen as a threshold based on general health considerations.
   - Regardless of age, we predict a bad outcome (1) for these patients, as higher depression scores are strongly associated with worse outcomes.

This decision tree focuses on mental health (depression score), physical health status, and age as key predictors of pain and disability outcomes. The HADS depression score is given the highest importance, followed by the SF-36 physical summary score and age.

Note that this is a simplified model and real-world prediction would likely be more complex and require validation with actual data. The thresholds chosen (8 for HADS depression,
