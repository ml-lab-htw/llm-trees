**Explanation:**

This decision tree is designed with a maximum depth of 2, meaning it has two levels of decision-making before arriving at a prediction.  I've chosen features and thresholds based on potential relevance to pain and disability outcomes, but without analyzing actual data, these are just educated guesses.

* **Root Node (Level 1):** The tree first assesses a combination of initial pain intensity ('bl_cpgs_intensity_average') and sleep quality ('bl_sleep_quality').  If a patient reports high initial pain (greater than or equal to 6) and poor sleep quality (4 or less), they are immediately classified as having a bad outcome (prediction = 1). 

* **Left Branch (Level 2 - Rule 1):**  This branch is only reached if the patient did **not** have both high initial pain and poor sleep. Here, the tree considers PTSD symptoms ('ies_r_total') and age. If the patient has high PTSD symptoms (total score 26 or higher) and is relatively young (35 years old or younger), they are also classified as having a bad outcome. 

* **Right Branch (Level 2 - Rule 2):** This branch represents patients who did not meet the criteria for either of the previous bad outcome classifications, suggesting they may have a better prognosis. They are assigned a prediction of good outcome (0).

**Important Notes:**

* **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds used in this example (e.g., pain intensity >= 6, age <= 35) are somewhat arbitrary without data analysis.  Optimal thresholds would be determined by analyzing how these features relate to outcomes in a real dataset.
* **Feature Importance:**  The selection of 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average', 'bl_sleep_quality', 'ies_r_total', and 'age' as the splitting features is also a guess.  Real data might reveal that other features are more important for predicting outcomes.
* **Model Evaluation:**  It's crucial to remember that this is a simplified model and should not be used for actual medical decision-making. Thorough evaluation on a large, labeled dataset is essential to assess the model's accuracy and reliability.
