**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **More Meaningful Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with more realistic values based on typical clinical interpretations. For example, an IES-R score above 30 is often indicative of significant distress.  You'll likely want to adjust these based on your specific data distribution and clinical experience.
* **Feature Selection:** I've prioritized features like `ies_r_total`, `bl_cpgs_intensity_worst`, `sf36_physical_summary`, `days_in_hospital`, `iss_category`, and `nb_of_fractures` based on their likely relevance to pain and disability outcomes.
* **Clearer Logic:**  The if/else structure mirrors the decision tree logic.
* **Node Tracking:**  The `nodes` list accurately records the truth value of each decision node. This can be useful for understanding the path taken for a given prediction.

**Crucial next steps:**

1. **Training with Real Data:** This function is a *template*. Its accuracy depends entirely on training with a real dataset and evaluating its performance.
2. **Scikit-learn:**  I strongly recommend using a machine learning library like scikit-learn. It will automatically learn the best tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds from your data, resulting in a far more accurate and robust model.  Trying to hand-craft a decision tree like this is generally not effective for complex real-world problems.



This improved example gives a more practical starting point, but remember that the real value comes from training on your dataset.  Provide your data, and I can help you create a much better model using scikit-learn.
