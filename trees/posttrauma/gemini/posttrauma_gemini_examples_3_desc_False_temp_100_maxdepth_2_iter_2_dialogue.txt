I can help you create that function. However, without any data to analyze, I can only provide a template based on your feature descriptions. 

**Important:** The thresholds below are chosen based on general medical knowledge and the provided feature descriptions, but they are **not optimized** on real data. You **must** replace them with thresholds learned from a real dataset and decision tree training process for accurate predictions.

```python
def predict_pain_disability(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts pain and disability outcome at 6 months following trauma.

    Args:
        X (dict): Dictionary of patient features.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            - prediction (int): 0 for good outcome, 1 for bad outcome.
            - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1 if satisfied, 0 otherwise).
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None] 

    # Node 1: High initial pain intensity?
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] >= 6  

    # Node 2: High psychological distress?
    nodes[1] = X["ies_r_total"] >= 24 

    if nodes[0]:  # High initial pain
        if nodes[1]:  # High distress
            prediction = 1  # Likely bad outcome
        else:  # Lower distress
            prediction = 0  # Might still recover well
    else:  # Lower initial pain
        prediction = 0  # Generally good prognosis

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

* **Depth 2:** The tree has one root node and two child nodes, limiting its complexity.
* **Feature Selection:** I chose "bl_cpgs_intensity_average" (initial pain) and "ies_r_total" (psychological distress) as they are known to be strong predictors of long-term pain and disability after trauma.
* **Thresholds:** The values 6 for pain and 24 for IES-R are placeholders. You **must** find appropriate thresholds from your data analysis.
* **Logic:** The tree follows a logical path:
    1. High initial pain is a risk factor.
    2. If initial pain is high, higher distress further increases the risk of a bad outcome.

**Remember:** This is just a starting point. You need to:

1. **Train a real decision tree** on your dataset to get accurate thresholds and potentially discover more important features.
2. **Evaluate the tree's performance** to ensure it generalizes well to new cases. 
3. **Consider more complex models** if a depth-2 tree isn't accurate enough.
