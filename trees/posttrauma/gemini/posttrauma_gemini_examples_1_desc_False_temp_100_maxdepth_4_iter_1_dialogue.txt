**Explanation and Rationale:**

* **Thresholds:** I've added reasonable threshold values based on the feature descriptions and clinical context. These would need to be refined with real data analysis.
* **Feature Selection:**  The selection is based on plausible relationships to pain and disability outcomes following trauma.  Pain intensity, PTSD symptoms (IES-R), physical function (SF-36), and age are all relevant factors.
* **Tree Logic:** The tree structure reflects a hypothetical progression of decision-making.  For instance, high average pain is a strong indicator of a bad outcome, regardless of other factors, in this simplified model. The combination of high PTSD and low physical function is also weighted heavily.
* **Target Variable Encoding (0 = good, 1 = bad):** The code is designed to predict 0 for a good outcome and 1 for a bad outcome, consistent with your specification.



**Important:**  This remains a hypothetical example. A real-world application requires training a decision tree on your actual dataset using scikit-learn or a similar library to determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure for optimal predictive performance. Using appropriate statistical measures (e.g., AUC, F1-score) to evaluate the model's performance is crucial.  This example aims to demonstrate the format and logic of the requested Python function.
