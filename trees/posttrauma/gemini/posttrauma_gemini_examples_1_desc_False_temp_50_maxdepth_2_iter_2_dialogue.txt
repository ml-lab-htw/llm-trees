    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5  # Moderate pain threshold
    nodes[1] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.7  # Lower quality of life threshold

    if nodes[0]:  # Average pain <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # EQ-5D <= 0.7
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (High pain, low quality of life)
        else: # EQ-5D > 0.7
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome (Lower pain, decent quality of life)
    else:  # Average pain > 5
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (High pain regardless of quality of life)


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Rationale for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (Average Pain Intensity):** Persistent, higher average pain levels are a strong indicator of a poor outcome (bad pain and disability) after musculoskeletal trauma.  A threshold of 5 (on a 0-10 scale) is used as a moderate pain level. Patients with average pain above this threshold are likely to have a bad outcome.
* **`eq5d_5l_index_score` (EQ-5D-5L Index):** This measure assesses health-related quality of life. A lower score indicates poorer quality of life.  A threshold of 0.7 is chosen, as scores below this suggest significant impairment.  Combined with pain levels, this helps differentiate good vs. bad outcomes.  Those with moderate pain but a decent quality of life might have a better prognosis.



**Key Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  The thresholds are chosen based on reasonable clinical interpretations of the feature scales.
* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure directly reflects the decision tree logic and is easier to understand.
* **Correct Target Encoding:** The prediction aligns with the target encoding (0=good, 1=bad).
* **Focus on Provided Features:** Uses the correct feature names from the provided list.

**Important Considerations (Still Applicable):**

* **Data-Driven Optimization:** These thresholds are *estimates*.  Optimal thresholds and feature selection should be determined using a training dataset and appropriate model evaluation techniques.  This implementation serves as a functional example based on domain knowledge.
* **Model Complexity:** A depth-2 tree may still be too simplistic.  More complex models might be necessary for accurate prediction.



This refined version provides a functional Python implementation while maintaining the context and considerations for a real-world application. Remember that this is a *demonstration*, and actual model development requires data and robust evaluation.
