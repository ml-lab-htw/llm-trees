    # Using 'iss_score' (Injury Severity Score) and 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average' (average pain intensity) as hypothetical important features
    # A higher ISS score indicates more severe injury, and higher pain intensity suggests a worse outcome.

    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] > 15  # Threshold of 15 -  Assumes scores > 15 are more likely to have a bad outcome.
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5 # Threshold of 5 - Assumes average pain > 5 indicates a bad outcome.

        else: # ISS score is high BUT average pain is low
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome - potentially due to effective pain management despite severe injury

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`iss_score > 15`:** The Injury Severity Score (ISS) is a widely used measure of trauma severity.  A higher score indicates a more severe injury.  A threshold of 15 is chosen as a hypothetical dividing line.  In reality, the optimal threshold would depend on the specific trauma population and the definition of "good" vs. "bad" outcome.

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`:** Pain intensity is a crucial factor in patient recovery and functional outcome after trauma.  A threshold of 5 (on a 0-10 scale, for example) is chosen as a hypothetical point above which pain is considered significant and likely to contribute to a "bad" outcome.

**Important Notes:**

* This decision tree is a simplified demonstration. In a real-world application, feature selection and threshold determination would be data-driven.  Techniques like recursive partitioning, cross-validation, and grid search would be used to optimize the tree's performance.
* The choice of features (`iss_score` and `bl_cpgs_intensity_average`) is hypothetical and should not be taken as medical advice.  The most important features for predicting pain and disability outcomes would need to be determined through analysis of real patient data.
* The chosen thresholds (15 for ISS and 5 for pain) are illustrative examples.  Appropriate thresholds would need to be learned from data in a real-world scenario.



This improved version fulfills all the requirements of the prompt, including using specified feature names, returning a prediction and a list of node truth values, and providing a reasonable (though still hypothetical) structure and thresholds.  Remember that this is still a simplified example for demonstration and requires real-world data and training for accurate predictions.
