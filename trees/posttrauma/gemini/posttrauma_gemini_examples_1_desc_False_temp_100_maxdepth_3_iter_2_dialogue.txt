**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`:**  A pain intensity rating above 5 (on a 0-10 scale) suggests moderate to severe pain, which is a known risk factor for poorer outcomes.
* **`ies_r_total > 25`:**  An IES-R score above 25 is often considered clinically significant for post-traumatic stress symptoms, which can hinder recovery.
* **`crp_test > 5`:**  A CRP level above 5 mg/L indicates elevated inflammation, which can be a sign of more severe tissue damage and potential complications.
* **`iss_score > 10`:**  An ISS score above 10 suggests a moderate injury severity, potentially leading to more complex recovery.
* **`days_in_hospital > 3`:** Longer hospital stays can be associated with complications and a more difficult recovery process.


**Important Considerations:**

* **These thresholds are educated guesses based on general clinical knowledge and require validation with your specific data.**  The optimal thresholds might be different for your dataset.
* **This is a simplified example.** A real-world model would likely benefit from a more complex tree and more sophisticated feature engineering.  You should experiment with different tree depths, feature combinations, and thresholds to optimize performance.
* **Evaluation is essential.**  Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test set to assess the performance of your decision tree.

This example uses pain, psychological distress, inflammation markers, injury severity, and length of hospital stay as key factors in predicting outcome. These are likely relevant, but the true importance and interactions of these features can only be determined with your dataset.  Provide the data, and I can build a more accurate and data-driven model.
