**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Threshold Selection:** I've used reasonable placeholder thresholds.  For instance, an average pain score > 5 might indicate a worse prognosis, a physical function score < 40 suggests poor functional capacity, and a depression score > 7 could indicate a risk for a worse outcome.  **Crucially, these thresholds are guesses.**  You *must* determine appropriate thresholds based on your data and clinical expertise, or learn them from data using a decision tree algorithm (like scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier`).
* **Feature Importance:**  The selected features (average pain, physical function, and depression) are clinically relevant to pain and disability outcomes. However, a trained decision tree might identify other important features.
* **Tree Depth:** This is a simple tree.  A more complex tree, learned from data, could have more branches and potentially higher accuracy.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  Remember that you may need to preprocess your data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features) before using it to train a decision tree or apply this function.

**How to Use:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'age': 45,
    'bmi': 28,
    # ... (include all features)
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 7,
    'sf36_physical_summary': 35,
    'hads_dep_score': 9,
    # ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (bad outcome)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True]
```


This revised answer provides a functional Python implementation that adheres to the required format, uses meaningful placeholder thresholds, and explains the limitations and next steps. Remember to train a proper decision tree on your data for optimal performance.
