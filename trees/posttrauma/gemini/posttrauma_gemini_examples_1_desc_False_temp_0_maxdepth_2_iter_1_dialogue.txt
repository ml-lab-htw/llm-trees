```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5  # Threshold for average pain intensity
    nodes[1] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.7  # Threshold for EQ-5D-5L score

    if nodes[0]:  # Low average pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Low EQ-5D score (worse health state)
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # High EQ-5D score (better health state)
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # High average pain
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5`:**  This split assumes that individuals with lower average pain intensity are more likely to have a good outcome.  A threshold of 5 (on a 0-10 scale, I assume) is a reasonable midpoint.  This feature directly relates to pain, a significant component of the outcome.
* **`eq5d_5l_index_score <= 0.7`:** The EQ-5D-5L index score is a measure of health-related quality of life.  A lower score indicates worse health.  A threshold of 0.7 is often used as a cutoff for distinguishing between good and poor health states.  This feature captures the broader impact of the injury on quality of life.

**Why these features?**

While I can't perform true feature selection without training data, I selected these features based on their likely relevance to pain and disability outcomes:

* **Average pain intensity** is a direct measure of a key component of the outcome.
* **EQ-5D-5L** captures a more holistic view of health and quality of life, which is likely correlated with the outcome.

**Important Notes:**

* This is still a *hypothetical* tree.  Real-world data is crucial for building an effective model.
* The chosen thresholds are reasonable guesses, but optimal values would be determined during training.
* Feature scaling and other preprocessing steps might be necessary with real data.
* More sophisticated algorithms could likely improve predictive performance.


This revised response provides a functional Python implementation, justifies the chosen features and thresholds, and emphasizes the importance of using real data for model development. Remember, this function is ready to be tested and evaluated once you have your dataset.  You would replace the placeholder thresholds with those learned during training using a library like scikit-learn.
