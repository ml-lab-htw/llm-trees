```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Using bl_cpgs_intensity_average (average pain) and sf36_physical_summary (physical health)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5  # Assuming >5 is significant pain
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] < 40  # Assuming <40 is poor physical health

    if nodes[0]:  # High average pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Poor physical health
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else:  # Good physical health
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome (potentially able to manage pain)
    else:  # Low average pain
        prediction = 0  # Good outcome

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation of Threshold Choices and Logic:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`:** This assumes a pain scale where scores above 5 represent significant pain. This is a placeholder; a real-world application would require analysis of pain score distributions and clinical significance.

* **`sf36_physical_summary < 40`:** The SF-36 physical component summary has a range of 0-100, with lower scores indicating poorer physical function.  A threshold of 40 is chosen as a potential indicator of significantly impaired physical function. Again, this is a placeholder and would need to be determined based on data analysis.

* **Logic:**  The tree prioritizes pain.  If a patient reports high average pain, their physical function becomes the deciding factor.  If they also have poor physical function, the prediction is a bad outcome. If their physical function is good despite the pain, the prediction is a good outcome, suggesting they might be managing the pain effectively.  If the patient reports low average pain, the outcome is predicted as good regardless of physical function.



This function fulfills the requirements:

* **Uses provided feature names:**  The tree uses `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` and `sf36_physical_summary`.
* **No training required:** The thresholds are placeholders based on reasonable assumptions, not learned from data.
* **Returns prediction and node truth values:** The function returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing boolean values indicating whether each node's condition was met.
* **Maximum depth of 2:** The tree respects the maximum depth constraint.


Remember that this is a simplified example.  A real-world model would involve careful feature selection, data preprocessing, training a model on a dataset, and rigorous evaluation.
