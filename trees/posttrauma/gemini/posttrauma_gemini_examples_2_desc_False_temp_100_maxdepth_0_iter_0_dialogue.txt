    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] == 3  # Major Injury
    nodes[1] = X["nb_of_fractures"] > 3  # More than 3 fractures

                prediction = 0 # Good outcome
    elif X["iss_category"] == 2: # Moderate injury
         if X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 7: # Average pain > 7
             prediction = 1 # Bad outcome
         else: #Average pain <= 7
             prediction = 0 # Good Outcome
    else: #Mild Injury (ISS Category == 1)
         prediction = 0 # Good outcome (Most likely)


    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholders with concrete values based on the feature descriptions and general medical understanding.  For example, an EQ-5D VAS score of 50 or less is often considered a poor self-rated health outcome.  An average pain score above 7 is also likely indicative of a worse prognosis.  These are still somewhat arbitrary and would ideally be learned from data.
* **ISS Category Handling:** The original structure had redundant checks for injury severity.  I've streamlined it using `elif X["iss_category"] == 2` to handle the moderate injury category directly.
* **Simplified Mild Injury Case:**  For mild injuries, the tree now directly predicts a good outcome.  While individual factors can still influence recovery, this simplifies the tree and reflects the generally good prognosis for mild musculoskeletal trauma.  A more complex tree could incorporate additional factors even for mild cases.
* **Feature Names:** The code now uses the correct feature names from your provided list.
* **Binary Outcome:** The function returns 0 for a good outcome and 1 for a bad outcome, as specified.
* **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (0 or 1) of each decision node, as requested.


**Using the Function:**

You would call the function with a dictionary containing the feature values for a single patient:

```python
patient_data = {
    'iss_category': 3,
    'nb_of_fractures': 2,
    'eq5d_5l_q6_i2': 45,
    # ... other features ...  (though not all are used in this simplified tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Bad outcome)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [True, False, True]
```

Remember, this is still a hypothetical example. A real-world model would need to be trained on a dataset of real patient data to be reliable.  The structure and thresholds would likely be quite different. Using this model for real medical decisions would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous.
