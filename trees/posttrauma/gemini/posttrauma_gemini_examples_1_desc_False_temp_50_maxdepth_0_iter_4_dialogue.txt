**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **More Realistic Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds based on general clinical knowledge.  For example, an average pain score above 5 might suggest a worse outcome, while a lower EQ-5D-5L score indicates lower quality of life. These are educated guesses, and real-world thresholds would be learned from your data.
* **Feature Selection:**  The tree now uses features that are more likely to be directly related to pain and disability:
    * `bl_cpgs_intensity_average`: Average pain intensity is a strong predictor.
    * `eq5d_5l_index_score`: This captures overall quality of life.
    * `ies_r_total`: PTSD symptoms are often associated with chronic pain.
    * `age`: Older patients might have more difficulty recovering.
    * `iss_score`: Higher injury severity scores.
    * `nb_of_fractures`: Presence of fractures.

* **Clearer Logic:** The `if/else` structure is more directly tied to the likely progression of pain and disability based on these features.
* **`nodes` List:**  The `nodes` list is now correctly populated with the truth values of the conditions at each node.

**To use this function:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 7,
    'eq5d_5l_index_score': 0.6,
    'ies_r_total': 30,
    'age': 55,
    'iss_score': 20,
    'nb_of_fractures': 1,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict_pain_disability(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will print the predicted outcome (0 or 1) and the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds with values learned from your data for a truly accurate model!  You can use libraries like scikit-learn to train a decision tree classifier on your dataset and obtain optimal thresholds and feature splits.  This code provides a template for how to structure the decision logic once you have those values.
