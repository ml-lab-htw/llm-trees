    # Using bl_cpgs_intensity_average (average pain intensity) and 
    # eq5d_5l_index_score (EQ-5D-5L score, a measure of health-related quality of life)
    # These features are chosen as proxies for pain and disability, relevant to the outcome.
    # In a real application, feature importance would be determined from the data.

    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 4  # Assuming a threshold of 4 for average pain
    nodes[1] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.7  # Assuming a threshold of 0.7 for EQ-5D-5L

    if nodes[0]:  # Low average pain

            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome -  potentially experiencing disability despite low pain
        else:  # High EQ-5D-5L score (better health)
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:  # High average pain
        prediction = 1 # Bad outcome - likely experiencing pain and potentially disability

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 4`:**  This threshold assumes that an average pain intensity rating of 4 or below is indicative of a relatively manageable pain level. This threshold would need to be adjusted based on the specific pain scale being used and the clinical context.
* **`eq5d_5l_index_score <= 0.7`:** The EQ-5D-5L index score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect health.  A threshold of 0.7 is often used as a cutoff point to distinguish between good and poor health-related quality of life.  A score below 0.7 suggests greater disability and potentially a worse outcome.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Feature Selection:**  The choice of `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` and `eq5d_5l_index_score` is hypothetical and based on their likely relevance to pain and disability.  In a real-world scenario, thorough feature selection and analysis would be essential to identify the most predictive features.
* **Threshold Optimization:** The threshold values (4 and 0.7) are estimates and should be optimized using a training dataset and appropriate techniques like cross-validation.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  Depending on the data, preprocessing steps like scaling, imputation of missing values, and encoding categorical variables might be necessary before building the decision tree.
* **Model Evaluation:**  After training, the model's performance should be thoroughly evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test set.


This improved version of the code now includes a working function with plausible thresholds and a clearer explanation of the logic behind the decision tree.  However, it's still crucial to remember that this is a simplified example. A robust model requires data and rigorous analysis.
