**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:** I've attempted to use somewhat realistic thresholds based on the feature descriptions.  However, without data, these are just guesses.  For example, an average pain score above 5 might suggest a worse prognosis. An IES-R total score above 25 is often used as a cutoff for clinically significant PTSD symptoms. A low physical function score (e.g., below 40 on the SF-36) could also predict a worse outcome.  A long hospital stay (more than 7 days) could indicate complications that might affect long-term recovery.

* **Feature Selection:** I've chosen features that seem intuitively relevant to pain and disability outcomes.  Real data analysis would involve feature importance calculations to select the most predictive features.

* **Tree Depth and Complexity:**  This is a very simple tree for illustration.  With more data, a more complex tree with more branches could be created to capture more nuanced relationships.

* **Data is Essential:**  The effectiveness of this tree (or any decision tree) depends entirely on the data used to train it.  The thresholds and structure I've provided are hypothetical and should be revised based on real-world data analysis.


To use this function, you'd provide a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a single patient:

```python
example_patient = {
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 7,
    'ies_r_total': 30,
    'sf36_physical_summary': 35,
    'days_in_hospital': 3,
    # ... other features
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (bad outcome)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True, False]
```

Remember to replace the placeholder thresholds and potentially the entire tree structure once you have access to data and can perform proper feature selection and model training.  You'll likely want to use a library like scikit-learn to build decision trees based on data.
