    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] == 3  # Major Injury
    nodes[1] = X["nb_of_fractures"] > 2   # More than 2 fractures
    nodes[2] = X["eq5d_5l_q6_i2"] <= 50  # EQ-5D VAS <= 50 (poor self-rated health)

    if nodes[0]:  # Major Injury

                prediction = 0 # Good outcome (with potential for misclassification)

          else: # Average pain intensity <= 7
              prediction = 0 # Good outcome (with potential for misclassification)

        else: # Mild Injury

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The code now correctly uses the provided feature encoding (e.g., `iss_category == 3` for "Major").
* **Thresholds:**  Reasonable threshold values have been added based on general clinical understanding.  However, these are still estimates.  Optimal thresholds would be learned from a dataset using a decision tree training algorithm.
* **Simplified Structure:** The tree structure has been simplified slightly to be more manageable and interpretable, focusing on the most important features identified earlier. It now incorporates the moderate and mild injury classifications.
* **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (0 or 1) and the list `nodes` containing the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node. This fulfills the requirements of the prompt.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'age': 30,
    'bmi': 25,
    # ... other features ...
    'iss_category': 3,  # Major injury
    'nb_of_fractures': 3, # 3 fractures
    'eq5d_5l_q6_i2': 40,  # Low EQ-5D VAS
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Bad outcome)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True]
```



**Crucially,** this function provides a framework and a demonstrative example.  To build a truly effective decision tree model, you *must* train it on a real dataset using a suitable machine learning library like scikit-learn.  This will automatically determine the best features, thresholds, and tree structure to maximize predictive accuracy.  The code above should be considered a starting point for understanding the structure and logic, not a final, clinically valid solution.
