```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Hypothetical important features and thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["iss_category"] >= 2  # Moderate to major injury severity
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] >= 5  # Average pain intensity above 5 (on a 0-10 scale)


    if nodes[0]: # Moderate to major injury
        if nodes[1]: # High average pain
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else: # Low average pain
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome (potentially due to better pain management despite severe injury)
    else: # Mild injury
        prediction = 0  # Good Outcome

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Rationale for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

* **`iss_category` (Injury Severity Score Category):**  A more severe injury (moderate or major) is likely associated with a worse outcome.  The threshold of 2 separates mild injuries from more severe ones.
* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (Average Pain Intensity):** Persistent and higher average pain levels suggest a worse recovery prognosis. A threshold of 5 on a 0-10 scale represents moderate to severe pain.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Nature:**  This tree is constructed based on reasonable assumptions about injury and pain influencing outcomes.  A real-world application requires training a decision tree on actual data to identify the most important features and appropriate thresholds.
* **Depth Limitation:**  A depth of 2 highly simplifies the problem.  Real-world outcome prediction likely involves a more complex interplay of many factors.
* **Threshold Tuning:**  The thresholds (2 for `iss_category` and 5 for `bl_cpgs_intensity_average`) are illustrative.  Data analysis is crucial to determine optimal cutoffs.



This revised function adheres to the requested format, incorporating the specified feature names and a depth-2 decision tree structure. Remember to replace these hypothetical choices with data-driven insights when working with real datasets.
