**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`sf36_physical_summary <= 35`:** The SF-36 physical component summary score ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating poorer physical function. A threshold of 35 suggests significant functional limitation, potentially contributing to a "bad" outcome.
* **`hads_dep_score >= 15`:**  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression subscale scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. A threshold of 15 suggests moderate to severe depression, which is likely to negatively impact recovery and contribute to a "bad" outcome.
* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average >= 7`:**  Pain intensity, often measured on a 0-10 scale, is a crucial factor in pain and disability outcomes.  A threshold of 7 suggests relatively high average pain levels, likely hindering recovery and leading to a "bad" outcome.

**Important Note:** These thresholds are examples and are not based on any real-world data analysis. In a real application, you would need a dataset of musculoskeletal trauma patients with their corresponding 6-month outcomes to train a decision tree model and determine optimal thresholds. The feature importance and the relationships between the features and the outcome would need to be statistically validated. This example only serves to illustrate how you can translate a decision tree structure into a Python function using realistic features and hypothetical thresholds.
