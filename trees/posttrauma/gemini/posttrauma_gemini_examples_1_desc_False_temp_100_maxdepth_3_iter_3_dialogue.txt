**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`:** A pain intensity average above 5 suggests moderate to severe pain, which is a strong predictor of poor functional outcomes after trauma.
* **`iss_score > 15`:** An Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 15 indicates a severe injury, associated with increased complications and potentially worse long-term outcomes.
* **`eq5d_5l_index_score < 0.7`:** An EQ-5D-5L index score below 0.7 signifies a noticeable reduction in health-related quality of life, which is relevant to the "pain and disability" outcome.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Data-Driven Optimization:** These thresholds are chosen based on general medical knowledge.  For optimal performance, you should train a real decision tree on your dataset using a library like scikit-learn. This will automatically determine the best thresholds based on your specific data.
* **Feature Importance:** The chosen features are assumptions.  Feature importance can vary significantly depending on the dataset.  Use feature importance analysis methods from scikit-learn to identify the most relevant features for your data.
* **Depth Limitation:** The function adheres to the maximum depth of 3 as requested.  However, a deeper tree might be needed to capture more complex relationships in the data.  Experiment with different depths and evaluate performance on a held-out test set to find the optimal tree depth.


This revised response provides a functional Python implementation and explains the rationale behind the chosen thresholds. Remember that these are educated guesses and should be refined with actual data analysis.
