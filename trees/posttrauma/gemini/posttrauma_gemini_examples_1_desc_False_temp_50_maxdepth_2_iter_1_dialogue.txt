**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Selection:** I've chosen `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (average pain intensity) and `sf36_physical_summary` (physical function score) as hypothetical important features.  In a real application, feature importance should be determined through analysis of a dataset.

2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds (5 for pain and 40 for physical function) are also hypothetical.  These would be learned by a decision tree algorithm during training.

3. **Logic:** The decision tree logic reflects the assumptions that high average pain generally leads to a bad outcome.  If pain is low, then a low physical function score might still predict a bad outcome.

4. **Depth 2:** The code implements a decision tree of depth 2, as requested.

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes' conditions. This allows you to trace the path the prediction took through the tree.

6. **Example Usage:** The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a dictionary of features and interpret the output.

**To improve this further:**

* **Data-Driven Approach:** Use a dataset to train a real decision tree classifier. This will learn the best features, thresholds, and tree structure automatically. Scikit-learn's `DecisionTreeClassifier` is a good choice.
* **Feature Engineering:** Consider creating Features from the existing ones (e.g., interaction terms, ratios) to potentially improve predictive power.
* **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters of the decision tree algorithm (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf) to optimize performance.
* **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.


This revised answer provides a more concrete implementation and emphasizes the importance of a data-driven approach for building effective decision trees. Remember that this hypothetical example is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for medical decision-making.  Consult with medical professionals for accurate diagnoses and treatment plans.
