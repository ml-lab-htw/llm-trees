**Explanation:**

1. **Root Node (Node 0):** We start with "bl_cpgs_intensity_average" as a strong indicator. Low initial pain could suggest a less severe injury and better prognosis.
2. **Branch 1 (Node 1):** If pain is low, we then consider age. Younger patients often recover better from trauma.
3. **Branch 2 (Node 2):**  If initial pain is high, the severity of the injury (using "iss_category") becomes crucial.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:**  The chosen values (5 for pain, 35 for age, etc.) are illustrative. Analyzing real data will reveal more accurate thresholds for splitting.
* **Feature Importance:** This tree assumes "pain", "age", and "injury severity" are most important. This needs validation with your dataset. Feature importance analysis can guide this. 
* **Model Complexity:** A depth-2 tree might be overly simplistic. Don't hesitate to experiment with deeper trees or other algorithms as needed.

**Using the Function:**

You can use this function with a dictionary of patient data:

```python
patient_data = {
    "age": 42,
    "bl_cpgs_intensity_average": 7, 
    "iss_category": 2,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)

print(f"Predicted Outcome (0=good, 1=bad): {prediction}")
print(f"Inner Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

This will output the prediction (0 or 1) and the truth values for each node's condition, showing you the path the decision tree took.
