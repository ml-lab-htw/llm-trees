I can't provide a fully working Python function with specific features and thresholds WITHOUT the dataset. Feature importance and thresholds are determined by the data itself during the decision tree building process.

However, I can give you a template function and explain the logic, which you can adapt ONCE you have the data and use a decision tree algorithm:

```python
def predict_pain_disability(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0=good, 1=bad)
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Placeholder for two inner nodes (max depth 2)

    # Example logic - REPLACE with actual features/thresholds from your model!
    # Node 1: Example using 'iss_score' - adjust threshold based on data analysis
    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] <= 15

    # Node 2: Example using 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average'
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5

    # Prediction logic (adapt based on your tree structure)
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict_pain_disability(X: dict)`:** The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values for a single instance.
2. **`nodes = 2 * [None]`:**  Initializes an empty list to store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node of the tree. Since we're aiming for a depth-2 tree, there will be at most two inner nodes.
3. **Node Conditions (Placeholders):**
   -  You'll NEED to replace `X["iss_score"] <= 15` and `X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5` with the actual features and thresholds your decision tree model learns from the data.
4. **Prediction Logic:**
   - This part directly implements the decision paths of your tree. Since I don't know the structure yet, this is a generic example.  You'll likely need to adjust the `if/else` conditions based on the actual tree learned from your data.

**Key Points:**

* **Data is Essential:** You MUST have a labeled dataset to determine the best features, thresholds, and the overall structure of the decision tree.
* **Use a Decision Tree Algorithm:** Libraries like scikit-learn in Python provide implementations of decision tree algorithms (e.g., `DecisionTreeClassifier`) that you can use to train a model on your data.
* **Interpret the Model:** Once you have a trained model, examine the resulting tree to understand which features are most important and how they're used to make predictions.  This will help you fill in the placeholders in the function above.
