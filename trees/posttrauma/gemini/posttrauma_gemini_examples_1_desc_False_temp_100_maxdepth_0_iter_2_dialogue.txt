    # Using 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average' (average pain intensity) and 'sf36_physical_summary' (physical health summary) as example important features.
    # These choices would ideally be driven by feature importance analysis on actual data.

    # Thresholds are chosen based on reasonable assumptions about the data.
    # For pain intensity, a higher value likely indicates worse outcome.
    # For physical health summary, a lower score likely indicates worse outcome.

    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5  # Threshold for average pain intensity (0-10 scale)
    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] <= 40  # Threshold for SF-36 physical summary (0-100 scale)

    if nodes[0]:  # Low average pain
        if nodes[1]:  # Low physical health summary - likely bad outcome despite low pain
            prediction = 1
        else:  # High physical health summary - likely good outcome
            prediction = 0
    else:  # High average pain

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Feature Selection:** The provided features `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` (average pain intensity) and `sf36_physical_summary` (physical health summary) are used as examples. In a real application, feature importance from a trained model should guide this selection.
* **Thresholds:** The threshold values (5 for pain and 40 for SF-36 physical summary) are examples. These need to be determined through model training on real data.  The chosen values reflect reasonable assumptions: higher pain likely corresponds to a bad outcome, and a lower SF-36 physical summary score suggests worse physical health.
* **Depth 2:** The function implements a decision tree of depth 2 as requested, with two decision nodes based on the chosen features and thresholds.
* **Truth Values List (nodes):** The `nodes` list stores the boolean results of the conditions at each node.  `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first split (average pain intensity), and `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second split (given the first condition is met), reflecting the path taken through the tree.
* **No Training:** This function does *not* train a decision tree. It implements a predefined structure based on assumed important features and thresholds.  To build a true decision tree model, you'd use a machine learning library with training data.


This refined answer provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree logic while highlighting the important aspects of feature selection, threshold determination, and the interpretation of the `nodes` list. Remember to replace the example features and thresholds with values derived from proper feature importance analysis and model training on your actual dataset.
