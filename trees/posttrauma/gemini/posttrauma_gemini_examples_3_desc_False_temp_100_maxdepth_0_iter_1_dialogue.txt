**Explanation and Justification of Choices:**

* **Injury Severity Score (ISS):** A higher ISS category (moderate or major) is a strong indicator of a potentially worse outcome.
* **Average Pain Intensity:** Persistent high average pain is a key factor in long-term disability.  A threshold of 5 (on a 0-10 scale) is a reasonable starting point, but this could be adjusted based on clinical data.
* **HADS Depression Score:** Depression is highly comorbid with chronic pain and can significantly impact recovery. A score above 8 on the HADS-D is often considered clinically significant.
* **SF-36 Physical Summary:** This provides a measure of physical functioning.  A lower score suggests greater disability.  A threshold of 40 was chosen hypothetically, as lower scores typically indicate more significant limitations.


**Important Notes:**

* **Hypothetical Tree:** This decision tree is based on logical assumptions and general clinical knowledge.  It's crucial to emphasize that without real data, this is just a hypothetical example. The thresholds and feature choices are not based on any statistical analysis.
* **Data-Driven Approach:** A true decision tree model should be built using a dataset and appropriate machine learning algorithms. The process would involve feature selection based on statistical significance, and the thresholds would be determined by the algorithm to optimize performance.
* **Threshold Tuning:**  The thresholds used (5 for pain, 8 for HADS-D, 40 for SF-36 Physical) are examples and need to be carefully tuned using a training dataset and appropriate evaluation metrics.
* **Feature Importance:** The selected features are likely to be important, but their actual importance and the optimal thresholds should be determined through data analysis.  Other features might turn out to be more predictive.



This improved answer provides a Python function that follows the requested format and incorporates clinically relevant features and thresholds.  It also stresses the importance of using real data to build a reliable and accurate model.
