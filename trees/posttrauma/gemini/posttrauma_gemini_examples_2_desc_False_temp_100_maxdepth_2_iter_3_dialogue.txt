I can't provide a fully working Python function with specific features and thresholds WITHOUT the dataset. Feature importance and thresholds are determined by the data itself during the decision tree building process.

However, I can give you a template function and explain the logic, which you can adapt ONCE you have the data and use a decision tree algorithm:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0=good, 1=bad)
               and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Placeholder for two inner nodes (max depth 2)

    # Example logic - REPLACE with actual features/thresholds from your model!
    # Node 1: Example using 'iss_score' - adjust threshold based on data analysis
    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] <= 15

    # Node 2: Example using 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average'
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5

    # Prediction logic (adapt based on your tree structure)
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes

```
