**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 5`:**  An average pain score above 5 suggests moderate to severe pain, which is likely to be associated with worse outcomes.
* **`hads_anx_score > 8`:** A HADS anxiety score above 8 indicates possible anxiety cases, which could influence pain perception and recovery.
* **`iss_score > 9`:**  An Injury Severity Score above 9 suggests more severe injuries, potentially leading to prolonged disability.
* **`bl_sleep_24hrs < 6`:** Less than 6 hours of sleep in the past 24 hours can negatively impact recovery and increase pain sensitivity.
* **`crp_test > 3.0`:** C-reactive protein (CRP) above 3.0 mg/L indicates inflammation, which could contribute to a worse outcome.
* **`sf36_physical_summary < 40`:** A low SF-36 physical component summary score (<40) points towards significantly impaired physical function, likely leading to a bad outcome.
* **`eq5d_5l_index_score < 0.7`:** EQ-5D-5L index score below 0.7 reflects reduced quality of life, which is indicative of a bad outcome.



**Important Notes:**

* This is still a *hypothetical* tree. The actual feature importance and thresholds would be learned from a real dataset.
* The chosen thresholds are based on general clinical reasoning and published literature where available, but should be validated with actual data.
* This example uses a maximum depth of 5 as requested, but the optimal depth should be determined using cross-validation on a real dataset.  A simpler tree might generalize better.
* This function returns a single prediction and the node truth values.  To evaluate the performance of this tree, you'd need to test it against a labeled dataset and calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.


This revised response provides a more practical and clinically relevant hypothetical decision tree structure.  However, it's crucial to remember that the true structure and effectiveness can only be ascertained with real data and proper model training.
