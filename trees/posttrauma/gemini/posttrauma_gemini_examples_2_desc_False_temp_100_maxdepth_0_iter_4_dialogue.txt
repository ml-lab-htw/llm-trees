**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Meaningful Thresholds:** The provided code includes example thresholds based on clinical intuition.  For instance, an average pain intensity above 7 (on a 0-10 scale) might suggest a higher risk of a bad outcome. Similarly, a low physical function score (<40 on the SF-36) and high depression score (>10 on HADS) are likely associated with worse outcomes.  A major injury (ISS category 3) is also considered a risk factor. *These are just examples and should be refined with actual data analysis.*
* **Clearer Structure:** The `if/else` structure is organized to reflect a plausible decision tree logic.
* **Feature Selection:** The example tree uses a small subset of potentially important features. A real-world application would likely involve more features, and feature selection/importance analysis would be crucial.
* **Data-Driven Approach:**  This example is illustrative.  In a real application, you *must* train a decision tree classifier on your data to determine the optimal tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds.



**How to use the function:**

```python
# Example patient data
patient_data = {
    'age': 50,
    'bmi': 28,
    # ... other features ...
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 8,
    'sf36_physical_summary': 35,
    'hads_dep_score': 12,
    'iss_category': 2,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, nodes = predict(patient_data)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (bad outcome in this example)
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True, True, False]
```

Remember: This is a demonstration.  To build a robust and accurate model, you need to train a decision tree algorithm on your dataset.  The code provided gives you a functional structure and demonstrates how to incorporate domain knowledge into the initial feature/threshold selection.  You can then refine this based on data-driven insights.
