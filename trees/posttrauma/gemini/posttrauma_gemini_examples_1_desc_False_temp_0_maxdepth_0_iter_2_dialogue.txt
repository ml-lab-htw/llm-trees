**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds used in the decision tree (e.g., 7 for pain, 24 for IES-R) are placeholders.  *You must determine the optimal thresholds using a decision tree training algorithm with your data.*  These values are simply reasonable guesses based on general clinical knowledge.
* **Feature Importance:** The order and selection of features in the tree are also placeholders.  A decision tree algorithm will determine which features are most important and the best order to use them.
* **Data is Crucial:**  This function is a template.  Without your data, the tree's structure and thresholds are meaningless and likely inaccurate.
* **Evaluation:** Once you have data and train a real decision tree, you *must* evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  You'll also want to consider techniques like cross-validation to ensure your model generalizes well to unseen data.
* **Overfitting:**  Be mindful of overfitting, especially if you have a small dataset or a very complex tree.  Pruning or using simpler tree models can help mitigate this.


Provide your dataset, and I can help you train a proper decision tree model using Python libraries like scikit-learn. This will provide a much more robust and accurate prediction function than this placeholder example.
