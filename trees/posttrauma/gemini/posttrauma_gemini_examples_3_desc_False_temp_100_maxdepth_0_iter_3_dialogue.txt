**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`iss_category <= 1`:**  Mild injury severity is a strong indicator of a good outcome.
* **`nb_of_fractures <= 1`:**  The number of fractures is likely related to the complexity of the injury and recovery.  More fractures suggest a potentially worse outcome.
* **`eq5d_5l_q6_i2 <= 50`:** The EQ-5D VAS is a visual analog scale for health status. A score of 50 or below suggests poorer health and thus a potentially worse outcome.
* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 4`:** An average pain intensity above 4 (assuming a 0-10 scale) indicates significant pain, which could lead to a worse outcome.



**Important Notes:**

* **These thresholds are examples.**  In a real scenario, you would determine these thresholds based on analysis of your data (e.g., using ROC curves or domain expertise).
* **Feature Importance:** The chosen features and their order in the tree are based on assumed clinical relevance.  Feature selection methods on real data are crucial.
* **Tree Complexity:** This is a simplified tree. A real-world application might require a more complex tree to capture the nuances of the data, but would still follow this structure of conditional checks and leaf node predictions.
* **Missing Values:** The current function doesn't handle missing values. You should include appropriate handling in a production setting (imputation, special branch for missing data, etc.).


This improved answer provides a more realistic and practical Python function with a clear explanation of the logic and considerations. Remember, building a good decision tree requires data and analysis.  This function is a template, but the specific thresholds and features used must be determined based on your specific dataset.
