    nodes[2] = X["hads_dep_score"] >= 8 # Potential indicator of chronic pain and worse outcomes

            else:
                prediction = 1 # Bad outcome - despite younger age, pain and depression are factors

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Realistic Thresholds:** I've replaced placeholder thresholds with hypothetical but potentially reasonable values. These would need to be determined from data analysis in a real application.
* **Feature Selection Rationale (Revised):**
    * **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`:**  Higher initial pain levels might indicate a more severe injury and potentially worse long-term outcomes.
    * **`sf36_physical_summary`:** Lower physical function scores often correlate with poorer overall health and recovery.
    * **`hads_dep_score`:** Depression can influence pain perception and recovery.
    * **`age`:** Older individuals might have reduced healing capacity.

* **Clearer Branching Logic:** The `if/else` structure is now more directly aligned with the intended decision logic based on the chosen features.



**To use this function:**

```python
example_patient = {
    'bl_cpgs_intensity_average': 7,
    'sf36_physical_summary': 35,
    'hads_dep_score': 10,
    'age': 55,
    # ... other features ...
}

prediction, node_values = predict(example_patient)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 0 or 1 (good or bad outcome)
print(f"Node values: {node_values}")  # Output: list of True/False values for each node's condition.

```


**Crucially:**  This remains a *demonstration* of how to structure the code.  The actual feature selection, thresholds, and tree structure would need to be derived from a real dataset using a machine learning algorithm. You would use a library like scikit-learn to train a decision tree classifier with your data, and then you could extract the learned tree structure to create a similar function for predictions.  The function above provides the format and demonstrates how to integrate the decision logic into Python code.
