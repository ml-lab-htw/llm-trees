```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] > 15  # Threshold for major trauma
    nodes[1] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] > 5  # Threshold for moderate to severe average pain

    if nodes[0]: # Major trauma
        if nodes[1]: # High average pain
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
        else: # Low average pain (surprising given major trauma)
            prediction = 0 # Good outcome - perhaps good access to care and rehab
    else: # Not major trauma
        prediction = 0 # Good outcome likely

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation of Feature and Threshold Choices:**

* **`iss_score`:** The Injury Severity Score (ISS) is a widely used measure of trauma severity.  A higher score indicates a more severe injury.  A threshold of 15 is often used to distinguish between major and less severe trauma.
* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average`:** Average pain intensity is a crucial indicator of patient experience and likely recovery. A higher average pain score suggests a greater likelihood of a bad outcome. A threshold of 5 on a 0-10 scale represents moderate to severe pain.

**Important Notes:**

* This function creates a decision tree *without any training*.  The feature selection and thresholds are based on reasonable assumptions, but they are **not optimized** for predictive accuracy.  The thresholds themselves are somewhat arbitrary without data analysis.
* In a real application, you would train a decision tree model on a dataset to determine the optimal features, thresholds, and tree structure.
*  The depth of 2 is enforced by the structure of the `if/else` statements.
* The function returns both the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, as requested.  This list allows for inspection of the decision path taken for each prediction.


This example provides a functional implementation based on the prompt's requirements. However, remember that using this without proper training on real data will likely result in a poorly performing model.  It serves primarily as an illustration of how to structure such a function.
