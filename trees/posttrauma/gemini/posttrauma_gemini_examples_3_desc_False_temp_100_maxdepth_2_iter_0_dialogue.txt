I understand now! You want a Python function representing a decision tree classifier with specific formatting.  **However, without actual data to train on, I can only give you a template with placeholder features and thresholds.**  

Here's a template for a depth-2 decision tree function based on your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary of feature values for a single individual. 

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - prediction: 0 for good outcome, 1 for bad outcome.
      - nodes: A list of truth values (0 or 1) for each inner node condition.
  """

  nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize with enough space for a depth-2 tree

  # Example conditions - REPLACE THESE with meaningful features and thresholds
  # based on data analysis or domain knowledge:

  nodes[0] = X["iss_score"] <= 15  # Example: Low ISS score
  nodes[1] = X["eq5d_5l_index_score"] <= 0.7  # Example: Higher quality of life
  nodes[2] = X["age"] <= 30  # Example: Younger age

  if nodes[0]:  # First split condition
    if nodes[1]: 
      prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else:
      prediction = 1  # Bad outcome 
  else:  
    if nodes[2]: 
      prediction = 0  # Good outcome
    else: 
      prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

  return prediction, nodes
```

**To use this template effectively, you NEED to:**

1. **Analyze your data:** Determine which features are most important for predicting the outcome and identify appropriate threshold values for splitting. This might involve statistical analysis, visualization, or domain expertise.
2. **Replace the placeholder conditions:** Substitute the example conditions (`nodes[0]`, `nodes[1]`, `nodes[2]`) with meaningful comparisons based on your data analysis.
3. **Adjust predictions:** Make sure the final `prediction` values (0 or 1) align with your target variable's encoding. 

**Remember:** This is just a starting point. The accuracy and usefulness of this function depend entirely on the quality of the features and thresholds you choose based on your data.
