    nodes[1] = X["sf36_physical_summary"] < 40 # Threshold 2: Low physical function score
    nodes[2] = X["age"] > 40  # Threshold 3: Older age

            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

            prediction = 0  # Good outcome (potentially able to manage pain)
    else:  # Mild or no pain
        if nodes[2]:  # Older age
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (even mild pain can be problematic at older age)

**Explanation and Rationale:**

This function implements the decision tree logic outlined previously, but now tailored to the provided features and target variable:

1. **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average > 6`:** Average pain intensity is chosen as the primary split. Higher average pain levels are likely indicative of a worse prognosis (bad outcome).

2. **`sf36_physical_summary < 40`:** For individuals experiencing significant pain, physical function (SF-36 Physical Summary) is considered.  A low score suggests difficulty in performing physical activities, which would contribute to a bad outcome.

3. **`age > 40`:**  For individuals with lower pain levels, age is used as a differentiating factor. Older individuals might be more susceptible to long-term complications and disability even with initially lower pain levels.

**Threshold Selection:**

The chosen thresholds (6 for pain, 40 for SF-36 Physical Summary, and 40 for age) are examples.  These values should be determined using statistical analysis or machine learning techniques on the actual data. You'll need to analyze the distributions and relationships between the features and the target variable to identify the most effective thresholds.

**Important Notes:**

* **Missing Data:**  This function assumes no missing data. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to implement strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation or specialized tree algorithms that can handle missingness.
* **Oversimplification:** This depth-3 tree might be an oversimplification.  More complex interactions between the provided features might influence the outcome.  A deeper tree or a different model might be needed.
* **Validation:**  This decision tree is a hypothesis.  Rigorous evaluation and comparison with other models are essential to determine its actual performance on unseen data.



This Python function provides a concrete implementation of the decision tree, enabling you to test it with different input feature values.  Remember to refine the thresholds and potentially the tree structure based on data analysis and model validation.
