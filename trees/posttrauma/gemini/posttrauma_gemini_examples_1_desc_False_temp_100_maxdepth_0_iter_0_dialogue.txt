def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Using 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average' (average pain intensity) and 'iss_score' (injury severity score)
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5  # Threshold: moderate pain
    nodes[1] = X["iss_score"] <= 15  # Threshold: moderate injury severity

    if nodes[0]: # If average pain is low
        if nodes[1]: # And injury severity is low
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome (low pain, low severity)
        else: # Injury severity is high
            prediction = 1 # Bad outcome (low pain, high severity - potential for long-term issues)
    else: # If average pain is high
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome (high pain, regardless of severity)


    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Rationale for Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5`:**  A pain intensity average of 5 or below is considered moderate pain. This threshold differentiates between those experiencing lower and higher average pain levels.
* **`iss_score <= 15`:** An Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or less is generally considered moderate severity. This threshold distinguishes between moderate and more severe injuries.


**Logic:**

The decision tree prioritizes pain intensity.  If the average pain is high, the outcome is predicted as "bad" regardless of injury severity. If the average pain is moderate or low, the injury severity score becomes a deciding factor. Low pain and low severity suggest a good outcome. Low pain combined with high injury severity, however, could indicate potential for long-term problems and is thus classified as a "bad" outcome.


**Important Notes:**

* **No Training:** This function doesn't learn from data. The thresholds are chosen based on reasonable assumptions about the features and target variable but are not optimized in any way.
* **Simplified Example:**  In a real application, you'd train a decision tree model on real data to find the best features and thresholds.
* **Feature Selection:** The choice of  `bl_cpgs_intensity_average` and `iss_score` is a hypothetical example.  Feature selection techniques should be applied to a real dataset to determine the most relevant features for predicting the outcome.
* **Depth 2:**  The tree has a maximum depth of 2 as required, leading to a relatively simple decision boundary.  A more complex tree might be necessary for better performance on real data.
* **Evaluation:**  You'll need to evaluate the performance of any decision tree model (including one generated with this function) on unseen data using appropriate metrics to assess its generalization ability.
