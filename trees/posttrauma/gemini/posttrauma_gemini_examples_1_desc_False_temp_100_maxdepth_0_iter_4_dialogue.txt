```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Using 'bl_cpgs_intensity_average' (average pain intensity) and 'days_in_hospital' as example features.
    #  These choices are for demonstration and would ideally be based on feature importance analysis on a real dataset.
    nodes[0] = X["bl_cpgs_intensity_average"] <= 5  # Threshold of 5 for average pain (0-10 scale)
    nodes[1] = X["days_in_hospital"] <= 7  # Threshold of 7 days in hospital


    if nodes[0]:  # Average pain <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # Days in hospital <= 7
            prediction = 0  # Good outcome
        else: # Days in hospital > 7
            prediction = 1  # Bad outcome
    else:  # Average pain > 5
        prediction = 1  # Bad outcome

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Justification of Thresholds:**

* **`bl_cpgs_intensity_average <= 5`:**  A pain intensity rating of 5 or less on a 0-10 scale suggests moderate to low pain. This could indicate a better prognosis.
* **`days_in_hospital <= 7`:**  A shorter hospital stay (7 days or less) might suggest less severe initial injuries and potentially a faster recovery.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Feature Selection:** As mentioned before, these features and thresholds are examples. In a real application, you would need to perform feature selection and threshold optimization based on a training dataset and a suitable evaluation metric.
* **Clinical Interpretation:** These thresholds are arbitrary for demonstration purposes.  Consult with medical professionals to determine clinically meaningful thresholds for pain scores and hospital stay duration.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Ensure that the input features are appropriately preprocessed (e.g., handling missing values, scaling) before using this function.


This improved function addresses all the requirements: it uses the provided feature names, generates a decision tree without training, fills in plausible threshold values, and returns the prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes.  It is ready to be used with a dictionary of input features. Remember that its accuracy will depend heavily on the real-world relevance of the chosen features and thresholds.
