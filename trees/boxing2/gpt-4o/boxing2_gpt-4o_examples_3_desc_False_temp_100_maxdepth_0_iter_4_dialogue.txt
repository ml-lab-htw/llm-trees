Based on the given data structure and encoding, here's how we can construct a Python function that implements the decision tree and returns a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 0
    
    # Node 1: Check if the non-official judge is 'HBO-Lederman'
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # 3 corresponds to 'HBO-Lederman'
    
    # Node 2: Check if the judge is official and the round is in the first half
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 3: Check if the official judge is 'G. Hamada' in early rounds
    if not nodes[0] and nodes[2]:
        nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # 0 corresponds to 'G. Hamada'

    # Making predictions based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:  # Non-official judges
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 4:  # Sportsticker
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            elif X["Judge"] == 6:  # USA Today
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Default case, assuming bias towards Trinidad if not otherwise specified

    else:  # Official judges
        if nodes[2]:  # Early rounds
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                if X["Judge"] == 1:  # B. Logist
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Default case, assuming bias towards de la Hoya in early rounds if not otherwise specified
        else:  # Later rounds
            if X["Judge"] == 2:  # J. Roth
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            elif X["Judge"] == 10:  # van de Wiele
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Default case, assuming bias towards Trinidad if not otherwise specified

    return prediction, nodes
```

To use this function, you would call it with a dictionary of features, like so:

```python
features = {
    'Judge': 3,        # corresponds to 'HBO-Lederman'
    'Official': 0,     # non-official judge
    'Round': 5         # fifth round
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)   # Expected: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)             # Expected: [True, True, None, None]
```

This function uses the provided decision tree structure, checking conditions in sequence and filling in meaningful threshold values based on the given judge indices and rounds. The `nodes` list captures the boolean conditions used to make the final prediction, which helps in understanding the path taken by the decision tree.
