### Explanation of the Code:
- The decision tree logic is directly translated into Python.
- We first check if the judge is an **official judge** (`X["Official"] == 1`). This is the first decision point (`nodes[0]`).
- If the judge is official, we then check the **round** (`X["Round"] <= 6`) as the second decision point (`nodes[1]`).
- For rounds 1 to 6, we check the identity of the **judge** (`X["Judge"] == 2` for J. Roth) as the third decision point (`nodes[2]`).
- For non-official judges, we make decisions based on the judge's ID, as some non-official judges show a preference for specific fighters.
  
The function returns the **predicted winner** (0 for Trinidad and 1 for de la Hoya) along with a list of truth values (`nodes`), which indicate whether each condition in the tree was satisfied (1) or not (0).

### Example Input:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 2,        # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,     # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 5         # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True, True, True]
```

In this example:
- The judge is J. Roth (ID = 2), who is an official judge.
- The round is 5, which is less than or equal to 6.
- Based on the tree, J. Roth tends to favor Trinidad (0) in the earlier rounds, so the prediction is **Trinidad** (0).
