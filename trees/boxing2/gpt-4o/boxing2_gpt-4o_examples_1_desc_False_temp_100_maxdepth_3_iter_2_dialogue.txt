Here's a Python function that implements the decision tree you requested. The function follows the decision tree structure as described earlier and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values indicating whether the conditions at each decision node were satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check which official judge it is
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check the round number
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # Node 1: Check which non-official judge it is
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 6, 7]  # HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, USA Today, Associated Press

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check the round number
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 4
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first node checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`). This is the most important initial decision.
- **Node 1**: The second node checks which judge it is. If the judge is one of the official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth, coded as 0, 1, or 2), the decision continues down one branch. If it's a non-official judge, it checks whether the judge is one of HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, USA Today, or Associated Press (coded as 3, 4, 6, or 7).
- **Node 2**: The third node checks the round number. Depending on the round, either de la Hoya or Trinidad is favored.

This function returns:
1. **prediction**: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya, based on the decision tree.
2. **nodes**: A list with the truth values (1 or 0) for each decision node in the tree.

### Example usage:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would print:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True, True]
```
Here, the prediction would be 1 (de la Hoya), and all the nodes evaluated as `True`, meaning all conditions were satisfied to arrive at this prediction.
