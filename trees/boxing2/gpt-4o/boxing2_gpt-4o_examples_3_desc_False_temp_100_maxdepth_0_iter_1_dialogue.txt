Based on your request and the provided examples, below is the Python function implementing the decision tree. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values (Judge, Official, and Round) and returns the predicted winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) along with a list of boolean values indicating whether each inner node's condition was satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None] 
    
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 3]  # G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [4, 5]  # Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] in [6, 7]  # USA Today, Associated Press
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] in [8, 9]  # Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge: yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge in [G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman]
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            elif nodes[3]:  # Judge in [Sportsticker, LA Times-Kawakami]
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Default to Trinidad as a fallback
        else:  # Round > 6
            if nodes[4]:  # Judge in [USA Today, Associated Press]
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            elif nodes[5]:  # Judge in [Las Vegas Review-Journal, LA Times-Springer]
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Default to de la Hoya as a fallback
    else:  # Official judge: no
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 4
            if X["Judge"] == 10:  # van de Wiele
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Round > 4
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: Checks if the judge is an official judge.
- **nodes[1]**: Checks if the round is less than or equal to 6.
- **nodes[2]**: Checks if the judge is one of [G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman].
- **nodes[3]**: Checks if the judge is one of [Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami].
- **nodes[4]**: Checks if the judge is one of [USA Today, Associated Press].
- **nodes[5]**: Checks if the judge is one of [Las Vegas Review-Journal, Los Angeles Times-Springer].
  
The function traverses the tree based on these conditions to determine the prediction. The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the conditions at each node for further examination.

This structure ensures the function is adhering to the requested tree structure and logic while providing the prediction and internal node states.
