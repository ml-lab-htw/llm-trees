Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier you requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] > 0.5

    # Node 1: Check judge identity for unofficial scorers
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [3, 6, 7]  # HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press

    # Node 2: Check round number for official judges
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6

    if not nodes[0]:  # Unofficial judges
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judges
        if X["Judge"] == 0:  # G. Hamada
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # B. Logist or J. Roth
            if not nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 6
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]**: This node splits based on the **Judge** feature. Judges who tend to favor Trinidad in the scoring are **G. Hamada** (0), **B. Logist** (1), **J. Roth** (2), **Las Vegas Review-Journal** (8), and **van de Wiele** (10). If the judge is one of these, we proceed to check if they are an official judge.
   
2. **nodes[1]** (in the first branch): If the judge is official (**Official** == 1), the prediction is **Trinidad** (0), otherwise, it's **de la Hoya** (1).

3. **nodes[1]** (in the second branch): If the judge is not one of the listed judges (i.e., a non-official source like **HBO-Lederman**, **Sportsticker**, etc.), the model then checks the **Round** number. If the round is 6 or earlier, the prediction is **de la Hoya** (1), otherwise, for later rounds, it predicts **Trinidad** (0).

### Example usage:

```python
# Input example for round 5, judged by B. Logist (official judge)
X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function follows the structure of your requested decision tree and outputs both the prediction and the list of truth values for each node.
