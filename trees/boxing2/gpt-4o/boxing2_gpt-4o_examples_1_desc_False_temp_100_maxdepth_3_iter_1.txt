Sure! Below is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3, based on the Features you've provided (Judge, Official, Round), and the target variable (which fighter won the round, 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Judge is a key feature
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # Judges with IDs 0-5 might have a different judging style
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 2: Whether the judge is official or not
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official vs non-official judge
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: Round number can affect judgment in official judges
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds vs later rounds
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins early rounds with official judges
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins later rounds with official judges
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-official judges favor Trinidad
    else:
        # Node 2: For judges with IDs greater than 5, use round information
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 8  # Early rounds vs later rounds
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins early rounds with these judges
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins later rounds with these judges
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 1:** The decision tree first splits based on the `Judge` feature, dividing judges by ID <= 5 (who might have a different judging style) and those with ID > 5.
- **Node 2:** For the first group of judges (ID <= 5), we check if the judge is an official or not. For non-official judges, we assume they favor Trinidad. For official judges, we continue to the next node.
- **Node 3:** If the judge is official, we then split based on the round number. Early rounds (<= 6) are predicted to go to Trinidad, while later rounds favor de la Hoya.
- **Node 2 (for Judge > 5):** For judges with ID > 5, we use the round number to make the decision. Early rounds (<= 8) go to de la Hoya, while later rounds go to Trinidad.

This decision tree has 3 inner nodes and each node is based on one of the features: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
