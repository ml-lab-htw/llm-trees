Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the boxing features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
            - "Judge" (int): Judge (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
                              4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 
                              7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 
                              9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
            - "Official" (int): Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - "Round" (int): Round number (1 to 12)
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): Predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is an official judge
        # Node 1: Is the judge in {G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth}?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2}
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
        # Node 1: Is the round number <= 6?
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Features**:
   - `Judge`: Encoded as integers from 0 to 10, representing different judges.
   - `Official`: Encoded as 1 (Yes) or 0 (No), indicating whether the judge is an official judge.
   - `Round`: An integer from 1 to 12, representing the round number.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it either:
     - Checks if the judge is in the set `{0, 1, 2}` (official judges G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth).
     - Or checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`).

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the judge is an official judge and is in `{0, 1, 2}`, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).
   - If the judge is an official judge but not in `{0, 1, 2}`, the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya).
   - If the judge is not an official judge and the round number is less than or equal to 6, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).
   - Otherwise, the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 0,       # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, True]
```

This function implements the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 and provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
