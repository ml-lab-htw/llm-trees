Based on the Features (`Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`) and the target variable (`target`), we can now generate a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. Let's assume the most important feature for predicting the winner of the round is `Round`, as it could be a key indicator of fatigue or performance variation over time.

Here is the decision tree as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Assume the first half of the rounds favors one fighter

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Predict de la Hoya for rounds 1-6
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Predict Trinidad for rounds 7-12
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The condition in the decision tree is based on the `Round` feature.
  - If the round is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`), the function predicts that de la Hoya (1) won the round.
  - If the round is greater than 6, the function predicts that Trinidad (0) won the round.
  
- The `nodes` list keeps track of whether the condition was satisfied. If the condition is satisfied (i.e., `Round <= 6`), the first entry in the list will be `True` (or 1), otherwise, it will be `False` (or 0).

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input for round 4
X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 4}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(nodes)  # Output: [True]

# Example input for round 10
X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(nodes)  # Output: [False]
```

This decision tree has a maximum depth of 1, with a single inner node that splits based on the `Round` feature.
