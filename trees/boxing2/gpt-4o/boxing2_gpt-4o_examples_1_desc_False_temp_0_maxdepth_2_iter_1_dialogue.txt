Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) based on the input features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - "Judge" (int): 0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, ..., 10 = van de Wiele
        - "Official" (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
        - "Round" (int): 1 to 12
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied) for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is an official judge
        # Node 1: Is the judge one of {G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth}?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2}
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
        # Node 1: Is the round <= 6?
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` with the keys `"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"`.
2. **Nodes**: A list `nodes` is used to store the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it either checks:
     - If the judge is one of `{G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth}` (`X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2}`), or
     - If the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`).
3. **Prediction**: Based on the conditions, the function predicts the winner of the round:
   - `0` for Trinidad.
   - `1` for de la Hoya.
4. **Output**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round.
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 0,       # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1]
```

### Example Explanation:
- `nodes[0] = 1`: The judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The judge is one of `{G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth}` (`X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2}`).
- Prediction: `0` (Trinidad).
