Based on your provided Features and target variable, I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 using the most important feature. Since we are not training this decision tree on actual data, I will manually create a simple decision rule using a meaningful feature. In this case, I will consider the `Judge` feature as the most important feature for predicting which fighter won the round.

Here is the decision tree function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Decision rule based on the Judge feature
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # Assume judges 0 to 5 tend to favor Trinidad, others favor de la Hoya
    
    # If the condition is satisfied (Judge is between 0 and 5), predict Trinidad (0)
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree uses a single feature, `Judge`, to make the prediction.
- Judges indexed from 0 to 5 are assumed to favor one fighter (Trinidad), and judges indexed from 6 to 10 are assumed to favor the other fighter (de la Hoya).
- If the judge is between 0 and 5, the prediction is that Trinidad wins the round (prediction = 0).
- If the judge is greater than 5, the prediction is that de la Hoya wins the round (prediction = 1).
- The function returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions (`nodes`), where each element in `nodes` indicates whether the condition of the node was satisfied.

This is a simple decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, as requested.
