Based on your requirements and the given features, we'll create a decision tree classifier in Python. The tree will have a maximum depth of 2. Below is the formatted decision tree as a Python function that returns both a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None] 
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] < 3

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check the specific judge under official judges
        if X["Judge"] == 0:  # G. Hamada
            prediction = 0
        elif X["Judge"] == 1:  # B. Logist
            prediction = 1
        elif X["Judge"] == 2:  # J. Roth
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Handle undefined cases (for simplicity)
    else:
        # Node 1: Check the specific judge under non-official judges
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0
        elif X["Judge"] == 4:  # Sportsticker
            prediction = 1
        elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
            prediction = 1
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Handle undefined cases (for simplicity)
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X1 = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 1}  # G. Hamada, official
X2 = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 2}  # HBO-Lederman, non-official

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X1)
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X2)

print(f"Prediction for X1: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}")
print(f"Prediction for X2: {prediction2}, Nodes: {nodes2}")
```

Explanation:
- `nodes`: An array to keep track of the conditions evaluated at each node. Each element is `True` or `False` depending on whether the respective condition is satisfied.
- In this example, `nodes[0]` checks if the `Official` feature is `1` (Yes), determining the path to take within the tree.
- The subsequent node (`nodes[1]`), which varies based on whether the judge is official or not, checks specific judges and their respective predictions.

The given `predict` function will help determine which of the two boxers won the round, based on the provided features. For simplicity, the non-official judges that weren't specified in the original decision tree are handled gracefully by assigning `None` to the prediction, which you can refine as needed based on your data.
