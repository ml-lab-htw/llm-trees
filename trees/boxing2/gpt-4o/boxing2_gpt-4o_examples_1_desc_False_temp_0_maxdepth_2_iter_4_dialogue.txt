Here is the Python function for the decision tree you described, formatted to return a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on the decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - "Judge" (int): 0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker,
                        5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press,
                        8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele
        - "Official" (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
        - "Round" (int): Round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is in the first group (0-4)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is official (only relevant if Node 0 is False)
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Features**:
   - `Judge`: Encoded as integers from 0 to 10, representing the judges.
   - `Official`: Encoded as 1 (Yes) or 0 (No), indicating whether the judge is an official judge.
   - `Round`: Encoded as integers from 1 to 12, representing the round number. (Not used in this decision tree.)

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is in the first group `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` (G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker). If true, the prediction is Trinidad (0).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the judge is official (`Official == 1`). This is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is false.

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is true, the prediction is Trinidad (0).
   - If `nodes[0]` is false, the prediction depends on `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is true, the prediction is de la Hoya (1).
     - If `nodes[1]` is false, the prediction is Trinidad (0).

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes, indicating which conditions were satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 6,       # USA Today
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Get prediction and node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [False, True]
```
