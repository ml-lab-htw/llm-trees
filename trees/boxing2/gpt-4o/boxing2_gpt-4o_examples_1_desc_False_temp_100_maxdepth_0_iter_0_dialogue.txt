Sure! Based on the decision tree structure we discussed earlier, and using the exact feature names and encodings you provided, here is the Python function that makes a prediction and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Create list for storing node decisions

    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1  # B. Logist

    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Non-official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[2]:  # First 6 rounds
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judges
        if nodes[2]:  # First 6 rounds
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # B. Logist
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if the judge is one of the following: G. Hamada (0), J. Roth (2), Associated Press (7), van de Wiele (10), or Sportsticker (4). These are judges who tend to favor de la Hoya, so if this condition is true, we proceed to **Node 1**.
   
2. **Node 1** checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6). In this case, de la Hoya is generally considered to have won those rounds. If this condition is satisfied, the prediction is **1** (de la Hoya); otherwise, the prediction is **0** (Trinidad).

3. If **Node 0** is false, meaning the judge is not one of the judges in the first group, the model directly predicts **0** (Trinidad won), as those judges tend to favor Trinidad.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input:
X = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}  # Judge: G. Hamada, Official: Yes, Round: 5
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True]

X = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 7}  # Judge: B. Logist, Official: Yes, Round: 7
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False, None]
```

In this function:
- `nodes[0]` evaluates whether the judge is part of the first group (favoring de la Hoya).
- `nodes[1]` evaluates whether the round is in the first half (favoring de la Hoya) but only if `nodes[0]` is `True`.

This structure matches the decision tree we discussed!
