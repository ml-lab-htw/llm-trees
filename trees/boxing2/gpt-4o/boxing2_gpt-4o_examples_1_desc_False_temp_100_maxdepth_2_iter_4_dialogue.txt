```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the Judge is in the group that tends to favor de la Hoya
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in ["G. Hamada", "B. Logist", "USA Today", "Associated Press"]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == "yes"
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the Round number is less than or equal to 6.5
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes as input `X`, which is a dictionary of features with keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.
- It checks two conditions (nodes) in a top-down manner:
  - **Node 0** checks whether the judge is in the group that tends to favor de la Hoya.
  - **Node 1** (split into two cases depending on the outcome of node 0):
    - If the judge tends to favor de la Hoya, then it checks whether the judge is an official.
    - If the judge does not tend to favor de la Hoya, it checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.5.
- Based on these conditions, the function assigns either `0` (Trinidad) or `1` (de la Hoya) as the prediction.
- The function also returns the list `nodes`, representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 for true, 0 for false).

Example usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": "G. Hamada",
    "Official": "yes",
    "Round": 5
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output:

```text
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True]
```

This means that the condition in node 0 was true (the judge is in the group that tends to favor de la Hoya), and the condition in node 1 was also true (the judge is an official judge). Therefore, the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya).
