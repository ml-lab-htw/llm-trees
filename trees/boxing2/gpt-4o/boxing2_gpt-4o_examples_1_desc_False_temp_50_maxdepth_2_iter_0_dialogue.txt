Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. The function follows the requested structure and uses the provided feature keys, feature encodings, and target variable encoding.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict which fighter won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - "Judge" (int): Judge (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker,
                               5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press,
                               8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
        - "Official" (int): Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - "Round" (int): Round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): Predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied)
                        for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Judge is in [3, 4, 6] (HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, USA Today)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 6]
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or USA Today
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Not an official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # Judge is not HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or USA Today
        # Node 1: Check if Round <= 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Round is 1 to 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round is 7 to 12
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `X` is a dictionary containing the features: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
   - The values in `X` must follow the encodings provided in the problem statement.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the `Judge` is one of HBO-Lederman (3), Sportsticker (4), or USA Today (6).
   - `nodes[1]` depends on the branch:
     - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (Judge is HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or USA Today), `nodes[1]` checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
     - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (other judges), `nodes[1]` checks if the `Round` is less than or equal to 6.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Based on the conditions at the inner nodes, the function predicts the winner of the round:
     - `0` for Trinidad.
     - `1` for de la Hoya.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round.
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values indicating whether the conditions at the inner nodes were satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 1,    # Yes (Official judge)
    "Round": 8        # Round 8
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1]
```

### Example Output:
For the input `X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 8}`:
- `nodes[0] = 1` because the Judge is HBO-Lederman (3).
- `nodes[1] = 1` because the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
- The prediction is `0` (Trinidad).
