Here is a decision tree of depth 3 using the Features and prediction target you provided. I've named the inner nodes based on some hypothetical conditions I created using the feature importance:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First decision: Which judge is scoring the round? 
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # For judges 0-5, use different criteria.
    
    # Second decision: Was the judge an official judge?
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is this an official score?
        
        # Third decision: What round is being scored?
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds, typically more balanced
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins early rounds, according to this judge and official criteria
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins later rounds, for official judges
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Non-official judges tend to favor Trinidad
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 9  # For judges 6-10, later rounds are more crucial
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official status still matters for later rounds
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins later rounds for official judges, according to this group.
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins when judged unofficially in later rounds.
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Early rounds favor Trinidad for these judges.
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:

1. **Node 0 (`Judge <= 5`)**: The decision tree first checks if the judge is one of the first 6 judges (`Judge` ≤ 5). Judges 0-5 have a different decision-making pattern compared to Judges 6-10.
   
2. **Node 1 (Official judge or not)**: If the judge is one of the first 6 (`Judge` ≤ 5), the model checks if the judge is an official (`Official == 1`).
   
3. **Node 2 (Round number)**: 
   - If the judge is official, the model checks if the round is an early round (`Round` ≤ 6), where Trinidad wins more often.
   - For unofficial judges, Trinidad is predicted to win regardless of the round.

4. **For Judges 6-10**: These judges place more importance on the round number, and later rounds (`Round > 9`) typically see de la Hoya winning, especially for official judges.

### Usage:

This function can be used as follows:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Inner Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will output the prediction (`0` for Trinidad or `1` for de la Hoya) and the binary list representing which conditions in the decision tree were met.
