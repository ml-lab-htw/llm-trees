Here's a decision tree based on the Features and target variable you provided, with a maximum depth of 4 and between 4 and 15 inner nodes. This tree will predict which of the two boxing fighters won each round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).

We will use the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round` to build the tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the judge one of the first 5 judges (more likely to favor de la Hoya)?
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4
    
    # Node 1: Is the fight judged by an official judge? (official judges may have more conservative scoring)
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 2: Is the round number greater than 6? (late rounds may favor certain fighters)
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    # Node 3: Is the judge one of the first 3 judges (possibly more biased towards de la Hoya)?
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] <= 2

    if nodes[0]:  # Judge is among the first 5
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Round > 6
                if nodes[3]:  # Judge is among the first 3
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:  # Round <= 6
                if nodes[3]:  # Judge is among the first 3
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:  # Not an official judge, potentially unreliable scoring
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:  # Judge is not among the first 5
        if nodes[2]:  # Round > 6
            if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:  # Not an official judge
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: We check if the judge is among the first 5 judges (`Judge <= 4`). This is based on the assumption that some judges may have tendencies to favor de la Hoya.
2. **Node 1**: We check if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`). Official judges may have a more conservative and reliable approach to scoring.
3. **Node 2**: We check if the round is in the later stages of the fight (`Round > 6`). Fighters may perform differently based on the round number.
4. **Node 3**: We check if the judge is among the first 3 judges (`Judge <= 2`). These judges may be even more biased towards de la Hoya.

This decision tree makes predictions based on the judge's identity, whether they are an official judge, and the round number. The prediction is whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round.
