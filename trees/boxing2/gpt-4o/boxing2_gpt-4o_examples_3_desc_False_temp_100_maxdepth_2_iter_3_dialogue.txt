Based on the provided features and the decision tree example structure, I will now create a Python function that will make predictions according to the specified tree. 

To summarize, the features are:
- `Judge` (0 to 10, representing different judges)
- `Official` (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
- `Round` (1 to 12)

The target variable is:
- `which of the two boxing fighters won each the round` (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

Here's how the function will look:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2]  # Assuming 0 = G. Hamada, 2 = J. Roth as Trinidad-favoring judges
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# Example feature dictionary where Judge = G. Hamada (0), Official = Yes (1), Round = 1
features = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")

# Example feature dictionary where Judge = B. Logist (1), Official = No (0), Round = 5
features = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
- The first split (`nodes[0]`) checks if the judge is an official one (`"Official" == 1`).
- The second split (`nodes[1]`) happens only if the judge is official, and checks if the judge is in the set considered to favor Trinidad (`X["Judge"] in [0, 2]`).
- Based on the above nodes, the function makes a decision:
  - If the judge is official and in the Trinidad-favoring set, the predicted winner is Trinidad (`0`).
  - Otherwise, the prediction defaults to de la Hoya (`1`).

This function makes predictions and lists the true/false status of the inner nodes, as requested.
