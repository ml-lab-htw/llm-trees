### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is whether the judge is an official judge (1 for "Yes," 0 for "No").
2. **Node 1**: If the judge is official, we check if the judge is one of the three official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth). These judges have distinct patterns in their scoring.
3. **Node 2**: For these three official judges, the round number is checked. If the round is less than or equal to 6, de la Hoya performed better, otherwise Trinidad.
4. **Node 3**: If the judge is non-official, we check if the judge is from specific media outlets (HBO-Lederman, USA Today, or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami). If yes, early rounds favor de la Hoya, while later rounds favor Trinidad. Other non-official judges generally favor Trinidad.

### Example:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 0,      # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,   # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 5       # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True, True, None]
