### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]** checks if the judge is an official judge (i.e., `X["Official"] == 1`).
2. If **nodes[0]** is `True`, the model checks which specific official judge is scoring the round. Different judges have different tendencies, and the result is determined based on the round number.
3. Non-official judges (e.g., media outlets like HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, etc.) tend to favor one fighter consistently, and the tree reflects this by assigning predictions accordingly.
4. The **nodes** list is used to track which decisions are satisfied (1) or not satisfied (0) at each internal node.

### Example Input:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True, False, None, None]
```

This function simulates the decision-making process for determining which boxer won a specific round based on the judge, whether the judge is official, and the round number.
