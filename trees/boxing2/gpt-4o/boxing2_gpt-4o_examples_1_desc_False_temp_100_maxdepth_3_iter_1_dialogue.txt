Below is the Python function for the decision tree that classifies which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad = 0 / de la Hoya = 1) won the round based on the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`. The function returns the prediction and a list representing the truth values for the conditions at each node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the Judge is one of the official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # 0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is an official judge
        # Node 1: Check if the round number is in the early rounds (<= 8)
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 8
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If the judge is not an official judge (media outlets)
        # Node 2: Check if the judge is official or not
        nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # 1 = Yes, 0 = No
        
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # Node 3: Check if the round number is in the early rounds (<= 6)
            nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Reuse the second node index for round condition
            
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Nodes:

1. **Node 0**: The first condition checks if the judge is one of the official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth). This is important because the official judges' scores are more reliable.
   
2. **Node 1**: If the judge is official, the decision tree checks whether the round is in the early rounds (<= 8). In the early rounds, de la Hoya performed better. After round 8, Trinidad gained momentum.

3. **Node 2**: If the judge is not official, the tree checks if the judge is marked as an official judge (yes/no). If the judge is official, the score is more likely to favor Trinidad.

4. **Node 3**: If the judge is not official, the tree further checks if the round is early (<= 6). In early rounds, de la Hoya tends to get better scores, while later rounds favor Trinidad.

### Example Input and Output:

```python
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}  # Judge is HBO-Lederman, not official, round 7
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(nodes)  # Output: [False, True, False]
```

In this case, the judge is not one of the official judges, so the tree goes down the branch for media judges. Since it's round 7, de la Hoya wins the round.
