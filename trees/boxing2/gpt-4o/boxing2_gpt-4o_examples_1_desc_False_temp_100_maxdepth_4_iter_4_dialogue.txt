Sure! Below is the Python function representing the decision tree you requested. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the features `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`, and returns the predicted winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya), as well as a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (Unofficial judges and media outlets)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] >= 3  # HBO-Lederman and beyond
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Unofficial judges and media outlets
        # Node 1: Official == 0 (not an official judge)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 0
        
        if nodes[1]:  
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            # Node 2: Round <= 6
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth)
        # Node 3: Round <= 5
        nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 5
        
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Node 0** checks if the **Judge** is one of the unofficial judges or media outlets (i.e., HBO-Lederman and beyond, represented by indices 3 through 10).
2. **Node 1** checks if the judge is **not an official** judge (i.e., `Official == 0`). If true, the prediction is that **de la Hoya** won the round.
3. If the judge is an **official judge**, the **Round** is considered for the prediction.
   - **Node 2** checks if the round is **Round <= 6**. If true, the prediction favors **de la Hoya**. If false, it leans toward **Trinidad**.
4. If the judge is one of the official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth), the round is considered:
   - **Node 3** checks if the round is **Round <= 5**. If true, **de la Hoya** is predicted to have won. Otherwise, **Trinidad** is predicted as the winner.

### Example usage:
```python
X = {"Judge": 4, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f'Prediction: {"de la Hoya" if prediction == 1 else "Trinidad"}')
print(f'Node states: {nodes}')
```

This function applies the decision tree logic to predict the winner of a boxing round based on the judge, whether the judge is official, and the round number.
