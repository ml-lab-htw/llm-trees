Certainly! Below is the Python function representing the decision tree classifier for predicting which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / de la Hoya) won each round. The function also returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5
    
    # Extracting features
    judge = X['Judge']
    official = X['Official']
    round_num = X['Round']
    
    # Decision Tree Nodes
    nodes[0] = judge <= 3  # Judge <= HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = official == 0  # Not an official judge
    nodes[2] = round_num <= 6  # Round <= 6
    nodes[3] = official == 1  # Is an official judge
    nodes[4] = round_num > 6  # Round > 6

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    "Judge": 4,        # Sportsticker
    "Official": 1,     # Yes
    "Round": 9         # Round 9
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'de la Hoya' if prediction == 1 else 'Trinidad'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **`nodes[0]`:** Checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman or anything ordered before (i.e., G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth).
2. **`nodes[1]`:** Checks if the official judge status is 'no'.
3. **`nodes[2]`:** Checks if the round is less than or equal to 6.
4. **`nodes[3]`:** Checks if the official judge status is 'yes'.
5. **`nodes[4]`:** Checks if the round is greater than 6.

### Example Execution:
Running the function with the given example features will classify the results and provide boolean values of the inner nodes on the decision path. This approach allows tracing the decision-making process.

```plaintext
Prediction: Trinidad, Nodes: [False, False, False, True, True]
```

In the example provided:
- The judge is Sportsticker (index 4), meaning nodes[0] is `False`.
- The official judge status is `1` (yes), meaning nodes[1] is `False` and nodes[3] is `True`.
- The round is 9, meaning nodes[2] is `False` and nodes[4] is `True`.

The decision tree outputs 'Trinidad' as the winner for the example provided.
