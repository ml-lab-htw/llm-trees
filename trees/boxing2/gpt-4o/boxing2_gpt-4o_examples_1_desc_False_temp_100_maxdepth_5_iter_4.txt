### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: First, the model checks if the judge's ID is less than or equal to 5 (i.e., Judge IDs 0 to 5).
- **Node 1**: Then, it checks if the judge is an official judge.
- **Node 2**: It further checks if the round is in the first half of the match (rounds 1 to 6).
- **Node 3**: Another condition based on the judge's ID.
- **Node 4**: Finally, it checks if the round is in the very late stages (rounds 10 to 12).

The function returns:
- `prediction`: Which fighter won the current round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = De la Hoya).
- `nodes`: The list of booleans representing whether each condition was satisfied or not.
