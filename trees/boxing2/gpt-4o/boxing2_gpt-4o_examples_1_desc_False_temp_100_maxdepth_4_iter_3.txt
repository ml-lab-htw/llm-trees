Here is a decision tree with a depth of 4 and between 4 and 15 inner nodes, based on the Features you provided (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`). The target variable is predicting which fighter won the round (`target: 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya`).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    # Node 0: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    # Node 2: Check if the judge is one of the high-rated judges (e.g., Hamada or Logist)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]
    # Node 3: Check if the judge is from a specific media outlet (e.g., Los Angeles Times or USA Today)
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [5, 6, 9]

    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Top-rated judge (Hamada or Logist)
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                if nodes[3]:  # Judge from a media outlet (LA Times or USA Today)
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:  # Not an official judge
            if nodes[3]:  # Media outlet judge
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:  # Round > 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Top-rated judge
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:  # Not an official judge
            if nodes[3]:  # Media outlet judge
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6. Early rounds are often scored differently, so this is an important split.
- **Node 1** checks if the judge is an official judge. This might influence how objective or consistent the scoring is.
- **Node 2** checks if the judge is a highly rated judge (e.g., Hamada or Logist), assuming they may have a specific judging style.
- **Node 3** checks if the judge is from a specific media outlet like the *Los Angeles Times* or *USA Today*, which may have different criteria for scoring.

The decision tree is structured with conditional checks, and based on the path of decisions taken, it predicts whether `Trinidad` (0) or `de la Hoya` (1) won the round. The function returns `prediction` along with a list of truth values for each node (`nodes`).
