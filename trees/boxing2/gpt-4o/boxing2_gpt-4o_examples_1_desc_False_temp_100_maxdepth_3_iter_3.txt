Based on the Features and the target variable, here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3. This tree uses the most important features and is designed to predict which of the two boxing fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 1: If the condition in Node 0 is True, check if the judge is one of the specific judges
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  # Judges: G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker
        
        # Node 2: If the condition in Node 1 is True, check if the official judge is present
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge present
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:
        # Node 1: If the condition in Node 0 is False, consider judges in the second group
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Judges: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, etc.
        
        # Node 2: If the condition in Node 1 is True, check if the official judge is not present
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 0  # Official judge not present
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0:** The decision tree first splits based on the round number (`Round <= 6`). It assumes that rounds in the first half might be different in judging than those in the second half.
   
2. **Node 1:** If the round number is less than or equal to 6, the tree checks if the judge is one of a specific set of judges (e.g., G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker). These are assumed to have similar judging styles. For rounds greater than 6, a different set of judges are checked (e.g., Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, etc.).

3. **Node 2:** Depending on the judge group, the tree checks whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1` or `Official == 0`). The outcome prediction depends on the combination of the round, judge, and official status.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 0,      # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,   # Official judge
    "Round": 5       # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output:
```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True, True, True]
```

This means that Trinidad wins the round, and all the conditions in the decision tree were satisfied (`nodes = [True, True, True]`).
