Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function to predict which fighter won a round using the features you provided. The decision tree has a maximum depth of 2, and the nodes will return truth values according to the conditions specified. The prediction will be based on these conditions.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if Judge is one of the specified judges (0 to 10)
    # All judges are considered, so this condition is always true
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in range(11)
    
    # Second node: Check if judge is an official judge and the round
    if X["Official"] == 1:
        # Further split based on the round number
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Here's how you might call the function with a sample input:
```python
# Sample input where the judge is G. Hamada (0), is an official judge (1), and the round is 5
X = {
    'Judge': 0,  # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,  # Yes
    'Round': 5  # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation:
- **First node (`nodes[0]`)**: This node checks if the Judge is one of the specified judges. Since all judges are considered in our hypothetical decision tree, this node will always return `True`.
- **Second node (`nodes[1]`)**: If the judge is an official judge, it checks if the round is less than or equal to 6. Otherwise, it checks if the round is less than or equal to 6 for a non-official judge.

The function returns the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of truth values for each node in the decision tree.
