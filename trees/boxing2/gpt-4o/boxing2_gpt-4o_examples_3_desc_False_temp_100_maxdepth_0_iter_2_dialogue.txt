To create a decision tree classifier in Python that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, we'll format the decision tree for the boxing context. Please note that this logic is based on the example provided earlier, adapted to the proper feature encodings.

The final Python function implementation would look something like this:

### Python Function Implementation:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list with None for each condition check
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Evaluate conditions (conditions correspond to decision nodes in the tree)
    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] == 3)  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = (X["Official"] == 1)  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = (X["Round"] <= 6)  # Early rounds
    nodes[3] = (X["Judge"] == 4)  # Sportsticker
    nodes[4] = (X["Judge"] == 7)  # Associated Press
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:  # If Round > 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If not Official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif nodes[3]:  # If Judge is Sportsticker
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[4]:  # If Judge is Associated Press
        if X["Round"] <= 5:  # If early rounds
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # If later rounds
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # If Judge is Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
        if X["Official"] == 1:  # Official judge
            if X["Round"] % 3 == 0:  # Round is a multiple of 3
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Other judges
        if X["Round"] <= 7:  # Early rounds
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Later rounds
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage:
X = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 8}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization of `nodes` List**: This list will hold boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions in the decision tree.

2. **Evaluating Conditions**: Each node corresponds to a condition in the decision tree. The nodes list is populated by evaluating the conditions based on the input feature values.

3. **Decision Tree Logic**: The actual decision-making part of the function is structured as nested `if-else` statements that follow the decision tree structure.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns a tuple where the first element is the predicted class (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya), and the second element is the list of boolean truth values for the inner nodes.

### Additional Notes:
- Adjust the exact conditions and thresholds based on actual empirical data and insights derived from the dataset.
- The `predict` function can be modified or extended based on further requirements or additional features.
