Here is the decision tree for the Features you have provided, with a maximum depth of 2 and 2 inner nodes:

### Features:
- **Judge**: Judge (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
- **Official**: Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: Round (1 to 12)

### Target variable:
- **target**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

### Decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Create a list to store the outcomes of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Node 0 checks if the judge is an official
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Node 1 checks if the round is in the first half (<=6)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Official judge, rounds 1-6 -> de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Official judge, rounds 7-12 -> Trinidad wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Non-official judge -> Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks whether the judge is an official one.
- **Node 1** checks whether the round is in the first half of the match (rounds 1-6).
- Based on these conditions, the decision tree predicts the winner of the round, either **Trinidad (0)** or **de la Hoya (1)**.
