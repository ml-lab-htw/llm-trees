Based on the provided decision tree and feature encoding, below is the Python function `predict` that will return a prediction for which of the two boxing fighters won the round and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes of the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node evaluations
    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]) and (X["Official"] == 1)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] in [4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]) or (X["Official"] == 0)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 5

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    elif nodes[2]:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Assume default prediction as Trinidad wins if no condition is matched

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "Judge": 4,          # Sportsticker
    "Official": 0,       # No
    "Round": 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]:** Checks if the judge is among the official and reliable ones and if the judge is official.
2. **nodes[1]:** Checks if the round is less than or equal to 6.
3. **nodes[2]:** Checks if the judge is among the others or if the judge is not official.
4. **nodes[3]:** Checks if the round is less than or equal to 5.

### Running Example:
For `X = {"Judge": 4, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}`, the nodes list will be `[False, False, True, False]`, which would lead to a prediction that Trinidad wins (i.e., `prediction = 0`).
