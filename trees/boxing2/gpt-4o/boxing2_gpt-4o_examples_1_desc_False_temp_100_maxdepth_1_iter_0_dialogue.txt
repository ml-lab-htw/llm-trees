Here is the requested Python function based on the decision tree you provided. It uses the exact feature names and target variable mappings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # We have one condition since max depth is 1
    
    # Check the value of the 'Judge' feature
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]  # Judges: G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman, Associated Press
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya won
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad won

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes list**: The list `nodes` will store the truth value of the inner node condition.
  - `nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]`: This checks if the judge is one of those who tend to favor **de la Hoya**. These judges are encoded as `0 = G. Hamada`, `1 = B. Logist`, `2 = J. Roth`, `3 = HBO-Lederman`, `7 = Associated Press`.
- **If the condition is true** (i.e., the judge is one of the listed judges), then **de la Hoya** (encoded as `1`) is predicted as the winner.
- **If the condition is false**, **Trinidad** (encoded as `0`) is predicted as the winner.

The function returns both the prediction and the list of node evaluations (`nodes`).
