Sure, let's build the decision tree function to determine the winner of a boxing round based on the features ['Judge', 'Official', 'Round']. I'll structure it similarly to the examples you provided and ensure it adheres to a maximum depth of 2.

### Hypothetical Decision Tree Structuring:
After analyzing, let's assume we split first on 'Official' and then on 'Judge' as described in the conceptual tree earlier. This will be encoded into a decision tree format with depth 2.

### Decision Tree Function:
Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree and returns both the prediction and the truth values of each node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # List to store truth values for inner nodes at depth 2
    
    # Encode input features into a numerical format as described
    judge = X["Judge"]
    official = X["Official"]
    round_num = X["Round"]
    
    # Node 1: Split on whether the judge is official
    nodes[0] = official <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is not official
        # Node 2: Split on round number (hypothetically using round <= 6 as threshold)
        nodes[1] = round_num <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins if round <= 6
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins if round > 6
    else:  # If the judge is official
        # Node 2: Split on judge's specific tendencies
        official_judges_trinidad = [0, 1, 2]  # G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth 
        official_judges_delahoya = [3, 4, 6]  # HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, USA Today
        
        nodes[1] = judge in official_judges_trinidad
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins if judged by these judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins if judged by these judges
        
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    "Judge": 1,  # B. Logist
    "Official": 1,  # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

print(predict(example_input))  # Expected output based on example input
```

### Explanation:
1. **Introduction of Nodes:**
   - Node 1 checks if the `Official` judge status is `<= 0.5` (i.e., 'No' after converting to 1/0).
   - Node 2 then checks either the round number or the judge's tendencies based on the first split.

2. **Conditions within Nodes:**
   - If the judge is not official: uses round number (<= 6 is one of the thresholds hypothesized).
   - If the judge is official: further split based on the specific judge names categorized into those favoring Trinidad or de la Hoya.

3. **Truth Value List:**
   - The list `nodes` collects the binary outcomes of each internal decision.

### Note:
The feature thresholds and conditions are hypothetical and would normally be derived from analyzing actual data. The provided function may need adjustment depending on real data tendencies and statistical analysis.
