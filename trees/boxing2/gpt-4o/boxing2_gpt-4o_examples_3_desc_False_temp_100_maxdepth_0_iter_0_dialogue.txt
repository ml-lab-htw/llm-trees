Sure! Here is the decision tree classifier written as a Python function based on the provided features and decision tree logic:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = (X['Judge'] == 2)
    nodes[1] = (X['Judge'] == 0)
    nodes[2] = (X['Official'] == 1)
    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] == 8)
    nodes[4] = (X['Round'] <= 6)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge == J. Roth
        if nodes[2]:  # Official judge == yes
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[1]:  # Judge == G. Hamada
        if nodes[2]:  # Official judge == yes
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif nodes[3]:  # Judge == Las Vegas Review-Journal
        if not nodes[2]:  # Official judge == no
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # Other judges
        if nodes[4]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Testing the function
example = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
print(predict(example))  # Expected output: (1, [1, 0, 1, 0, whatever])
```

Explanation of the nodes in the function:

1. `nodes[0]` checks if the judge is J. Roth.
2. `nodes[1]` checks if the judge is G. Hamada.
3. `nodes[2]` checks if the judge is an official judge (yes).
4. `nodes[3]` checks if the judge is from the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
5. `nodes[4]` checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.

### Example prediction:
If you use the following example:
```python
example = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
```
The output would be `(1, [True, False, True, False, True])`, indicating that the overall prediction is 1 (de la Hoya) and the nodes' values are `[True, False, True, False, True]`.
