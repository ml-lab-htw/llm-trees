Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier according to the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # We have 5 inner nodes to keep track of truth values.

    # First split: Whether it's an official judge or not.
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        # Second split: Which official judge is scoring
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada
        if nodes[1]:  # G. Hamada
            # Third split: Early or late rounds (G. Hamada)
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[2]:  # Round 1-6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round 7-12
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # Fourth split: Is it B. Logist?
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1  # B. Logist
            if nodes[3]:  # B. Logist
                # Fifth split: Early or late rounds (B. Logist)
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 4

                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                # For other official judges, rounds <= 5 go to de la Hoya, otherwise Trinidad
                if X["Round"] <= 5:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad

        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            # Third split: Early or late rounds (HBO-Lederman)
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
            if nodes[2]:  # Round 1-7
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round 8-12
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # Additional checks for other non-official judges
            if X["Judge"] == 4:  # Sportsticker
                if X["Round"] <= 3:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

            elif X["Judge"] == 10:  # van de Wiele

### Explanation:

1. **Input**: 
   - `X` is a dictionary containing the features: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
   
2. **Nodes**: 
   - A list `nodes` is used to keep track of the decisions made at each split (inner nodes). Each entry in `nodes` is either `1` (True) or `0` (False).
   
3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The first decision (node 0) checks if the judge is an official or not (`Official` feature).
   - The following decisions (nodes 1-4) depend on the specific judge and the round number, with different thresholds for different judges.
   
4. **Prediction**: 
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: Either `0` for Trinidad or `1` for de la Hoya.
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values representing which conditions were satisfied at each step of the decision process.

This function mimics the structure of the decision tree you've described, using the provided features and target encoding.
