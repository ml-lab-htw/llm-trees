Below is a decision tree classifier based on the Features you provided (`Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`) and the target variable (which fighter won the round: `0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya`). The decision tree has a maximum depth of 3 and between 3 to 7 inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is part of a certain group (e.g., 0, 1, or 2)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge is G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth
        # Node 2: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Round is between 1 and 6
            # Node 3: Check if the judge is official
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                prediction = 1  # Favor de la Hoya
            else:  # Not official judge
                prediction = 0  # Favor Trinidad
        else:  # Round is greater than 6
            prediction = 0  # Favor Trinidad
    else:  # Judge is not in the first group (others)
        # Node 2: Check if the round number is greater than 8
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 8
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Round is greater than 8
            prediction = 1  # Favor de la Hoya
        else:  # Round is 8 or less
            # Node 3: Check if the judge is official
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                prediction = 0  # Favor Trinidad
            else:  # Not official judge
                prediction = 1  # Favor de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of Decision Tree:
1. **Node 1:** The first decision is based on the `Judge`. If the judge is one of the first three (`G. Hamada`, `B. Logist`, or `J. Roth`), the decision-making process goes in one direction, otherwise, it goes in the other direction.
   
2. **Node 2:** If the judge is in the first group, we then check if the round number is less than or equal to 6. This helps differentiate between rounds in the first half of the fight vs. the second half.

3. **Node 3:** If the round is in the first half, we check if the judge is `Official`. If the judge is official, the prediction favors `de la Hoya`, otherwise, it favors `Trinidad`.

4. **If the judge is not in the first group** (i.e., not one of `G. Hamada`, `B. Logist`, or `J. Roth`), we then check if the round number is greater than 8. If it is, the prediction favors `de la Hoya`, otherwise, we check if the judge is official again to make the final decision.

This structure ensures that the tree has a maximum depth of 3, with three decision nodes, and a mixture of conditions based on all three features (`Judge`, `Round`, and `Official`).
