Given the structure and feature encoding for the decision tree in the context of predicting which boxer (Trinidad vs. de la Hoya) won each round, here's the required function formatted as per your instructions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Evaluating the conditions for the nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Decision making based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Default to de la Hoya if "Judge" is out of expected range (though this may need adjustment)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Feature Encoding**:
  - `Judge`: Encoded from 0 to 10 where each number corresponds to a specific judge.
  - `Official`: Binary feature where `1` means "yes", and `0` means "no".
  - `Round`: From 1 to 12 (though not used in this simplified tree).

- **Function Structure**:
  - The `nodes` list holds truth values of the conditions at each node.
  - **Node 0**: Checks if the `Judge` falls within the expected range (0 to 10).
  - **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` equals 1).

- **Prediction**: 
  - If both conditions are satisfied, predict `0` (Trinidad).
  - If the second condition is not satisfied, predict `1` (de la Hoya).
  - If the first condition is not met (Judge out of range), predict `1` (default behavior).

This function will return the predicted winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of truth values for the inner nodes, as you required.
