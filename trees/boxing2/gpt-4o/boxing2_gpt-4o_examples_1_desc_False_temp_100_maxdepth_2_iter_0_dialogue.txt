def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == "yes"
    
    if nodes[0]:

        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in {"G. Hamada", "B. Logist", "J. Roth"}
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # Node 2: Is the round number less than or equal to 6?
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` which contains the features: `"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"`.
2. The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an **official judge**.
   - `nodes[1]`: If the judge is official, it checks if the judge is one of **G. Hamada**, **B. Logist**, or **J. Roth**. If the judge is not official, it checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
3. The function returns a **prediction** (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and the list `nodes` showing which conditions were satisfied during the prediction process.
