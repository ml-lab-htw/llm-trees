Hereâ€™s the decision tree based on the Features you provided for predicting which fighter won each round, with a maximum depth of 3 and between 3 to 7 inner nodes:

### Features:
- **Judge**: Refers to the identity of the judge scoring the round. (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, etc.)
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official one or not. (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: The round number. (1 to 12)

### Target variable:
- **target**: Which of the two fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

### Decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Decision based on the Judge
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # Judges 0 to 5
    
    # Node 1: Decision based on whether the judge is official
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    
    # Node 2: Decision based on the Round number
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Round 1 to 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the judge is among the first six judges (0 to 5). If true, the decision process moves to **Node 1**; otherwise, it skips to **Node 2**.
- **Node 1** checks if the judge is an official judge. If true, the decision moves to **Node 2**, which checks the round number.
- **Node 2** decides based on the round number. If it's round 1 to 6, the prediction is that **de la Hoya** wins; otherwise, **Trinidad** wins.

This decision tree is structured with 3 inner nodes, making it a depth-3 tree with logical conditions based on the features you provided.
