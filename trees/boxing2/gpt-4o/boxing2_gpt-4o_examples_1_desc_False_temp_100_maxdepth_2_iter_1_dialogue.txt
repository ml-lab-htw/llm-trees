def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the Judge is one of HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or USA Today
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 6]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the Round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Traverse the decision tree based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Judge is HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or USA Today -> predict Trinidad (0)
        prediction = 0
    else:
        # If Judge is not HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or USA Today
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Round <= 6 -> predict de la Hoya (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If Round > 6 -> predict Trinidad (0)
            prediction = 0

    # Return the prediction and list representing truth values of the inner nodes
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Conditions for Inner Nodes**:
   - **Node 0** checks if the Judge belongs to specific judges (HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, and USA Today). This is represented by their encoded values `[3, 4, 6]`.
   - **Node 1** checks if the Round number is less than or equal to `6`.

2. **Predictions**:
   - If `Node 0` is true, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).
   - Otherwise, if `Node 1` is true, the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya); else, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).

3. **Output**:
   - Returns both the `prediction` (class label) and `nodes` (truth values for the conditions of the inner nodes). This helps to understand how the decision was made by the decision tree.
