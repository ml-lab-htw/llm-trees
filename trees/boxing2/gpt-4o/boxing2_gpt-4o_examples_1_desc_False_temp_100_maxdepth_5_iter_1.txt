Based on the Features provided and a target variable of which boxer won the round, I will now create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 5. The decision tree will use the most important features provided in the description.

Here is the decision tree function in Python:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge is a key factor in the decision-making process
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Judges 0-4 are considered
    
    # Node 1: Official judge status can influence the outcome
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 2: Round number is crucial, early rounds might differ from later rounds
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # First 6 rounds
    
    # Node 3: Further splitting based on judge identity
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] <= 7  # Judges 0-7 are considered
    
    # Node 4: Further splitting based on later rounds
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 10  # Final two rounds (11 and 12)
    
    # Decision tree logic for prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 0: Judge**  
   The decision starts with differentiating judges. Judges 0 to 4 (lower IDs) are in one group, and others are in another group.
   
2. **Node 1: Official Judge**  
   The tree then checks if the judge is official (1) or not (0). This impacts how the decision progresses.

3. **Node 2: Round**  
   The round number is important, and this node checks if the round is in the first half (1 to 6) or the second half (7 to 12).

4. **Node 3: Judge (Extended)**  
   If the judge is still within a particular range (0 to 7), this further refines the prediction.

5. **Node 4: Final Rounds**  
   The final rounds (11 and 12) are treated differently from rounds 1 to 10, which may impact the decision.

### Usage:

You can call the function by passing a dictionary `X` with the keys `"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"` to get a prediction and the inner node truth values.

Example:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 2,         # Judge with ID 2
    "Official": 1,      # Official judge
    "Round": 7          # Round 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will return whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round based on the input features.
