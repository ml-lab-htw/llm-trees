Below is the decision tree classifier based on the Features you provided (Judge, Official, Round) and the Target variable (which fighter won the round). The decision tree has a maximum depth of 4, and it contains between 4 and 15 inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 5
    
    # Node 1
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 2
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [1, 3, 5, 7]  # Judges who tend to favor a particular fighter based on some prior patterns
    
    # Node 3
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] > 8

    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Specific judges in the list [1, 3, 5, 7]
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 8
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
            else:  # Judges not in the list
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 8
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
    else:  # Round > 5
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Specific judges in the list [1, 3, 5, 7]
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 8
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round
            else:  # Judges not in the list
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 8
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
- **Node 0:** The first split is based on whether the round number is less than or equal to 5. This might reflect that early rounds have a different dynamic compared to later rounds.
- **Node 1:** The second split checks whether the judge is an official judge. Official judges likely have a more structured and consistent way of scoring, which can influence the prediction.
- **Node 2:** The third split checks whether the judge is from a specific list of judges [1, 3, 5, 7]. These judges might have tendencies that could influence the outcome of the round.
- **Node 3:** The fourth split checks whether the round number is greater than 8. This could reflect a difference in fighter performance or judging tendencies in the later rounds.

Finally, the decision tree assigns a prediction based on these conditions, with `0` meaning Trinidad wins the round and `1` meaning de la Hoya wins the round.
