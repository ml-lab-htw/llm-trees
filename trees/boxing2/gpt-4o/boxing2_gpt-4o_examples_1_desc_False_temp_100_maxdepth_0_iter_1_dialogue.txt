Hereâ€™s the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the features you provided. The function will return the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) as well as a list of boolean values representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # First split on whether it's an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0

    # For unofficial judges, split on whether it's HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3

    # For official judges, split on whether it's Hamada
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0

    # Split on round number for Hamada's decisions
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 8

    if nodes[0]:  # Unofficial judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Hamada
            if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 8
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]** checks whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
2. If the judge is official, **nodes[1]** verifies if the judge is one of **G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), or J. Roth (2)**. If true, the prediction is **Trinidad** (0). Otherwise, the judge is **van de Wiele (10)**, and the prediction is **de la Hoya** (1).
3. If the judge is not official, **nodes[1]** checks if the judge is one of **HBO-Lederman (3), Sportsticker (4), Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (5), or USA Today (6)**. If true, the prediction is **de la Hoya** (1). Otherwise, the prediction is **Trinidad** (0), which includes the judges **Associated Press (7), Las Vegas Review-Journal (8), and Los Angeles Times-Springer (9)**.

### Example of usage:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 0,     # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,  # Yes
    "Round": 5      # Round 5 (this doesn't affect the decision in this tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True] (both conditions satisfied)
```

In this example, the judge is **G. Hamada**, who is an official judge and tends to favor **Trinidad**, leading to a prediction of 0 (Trinidad).
