Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features from your new dataset:

### Features:
- **Judge**: The specific judge scoring the round (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: The round number in the match (1 to 12)

### Target variable:
- **target**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

---

### Decision Tree:
For this task, we'll build a decision tree based on the provided features, with a maximum depth of 2. The inner nodes will be based on the most important features for predicting the target. We'll use the "Official" and "Judge" features in this example.

Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of inner nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Whether the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Second decision node: Which judge is scoring the round (only if the judge is official)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Example: Judges 0, 1, 2, and 3 tend to favor de la Hoya

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Judges who are not official tend to favor Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

---

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 1**: The first decision checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`). If the judge is official, we proceed to the second node. If not, the prediction defaults to Trinidad winning the round (prediction = 0).

2. **Node 2**: If the judge is official, the second decision checks which judge is scoring the round. In this case, judges 0 (G. Hamada), 1 (B. Logist), 2 (J. Roth), and 3 (HBO-Lederman) are assumed to favor de la Hoya, so if the judge falls into this group, the prediction is that de la Hoya wins the round (prediction = 1). Otherwise, the prediction is that Trinidad wins the round (prediction = 0).

### Example Predictions:

```python
# Example 1
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya wins), Nodes: [True, True]

# Example 2
X = {"Judge": 5, "Official": 1, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad wins), Nodes: [True, False]

# Example 3
X = {"Judge": 7, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad wins), Nodes: [False, None]
```

In this decision tree, the primary deciding factors are whether the judge is official and which specific judge is scoring, as these are considered the most important features based on your description.
