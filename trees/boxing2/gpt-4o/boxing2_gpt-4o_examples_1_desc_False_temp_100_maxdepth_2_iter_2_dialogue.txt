    # Decision logic

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks whether the judge is one of the official judges (`G. Hamada`, `B. Logist`, or `J. Roth`) by checking if `Judge` is in the list `[0, 1, 2]`.
- **Node 1** has two different checks depending on whether Node 0 is satisfied:
  - If `Judge` is one of the official judges, it checks whether the round (`Round`) is in the first half of the fight (1 to 6).
  - If `Judge` is not one of the official judges, it checks whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
  
Based on these two conditions, the function returns the predicted winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
