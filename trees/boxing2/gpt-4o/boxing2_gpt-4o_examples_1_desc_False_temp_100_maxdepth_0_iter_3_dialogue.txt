Here is the Python function based on the decision tree you provided, which predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round using the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # For the three decision nodes in our tree

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5  # First split on Official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 7  # Split on Round
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Check if Judge is Hamada (0)

    if nodes[0]:  # If not official judge
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # If HBO-Lederman
            if X["Round"] <= 6:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        elif X["Judge"] in [6, 7, 5]:  # If Associated Press/USA Today/LA Times
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Default to de la Hoya for other unofficial judges
    else:  # If official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 7
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 7
            if nodes[2]:  # If Hamada
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:  # If Logist or Roth
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 1** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if the judge is official (`"Official" == 1`). This is the root decision node.
- **Node 2** (`nodes[1]`): Depending on whether the judge is official or not, the second decision node changes:
  - If the judge is official, we check if the judge is one of G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth (favoring de la Hoya).
  - If the judge is not official, we check if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (de la Hoya tends to dominate early rounds).

### Input:
- `X` is a dictionary containing the features `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.

### Output:
- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.

### Example usage:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 0,    # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1, # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 4     # Round 4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output:

```python
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True]
```

This means de la Hoya is predicted to have won the round, and both conditions (official judge and judge favoring de la Hoya) were satisfied.
