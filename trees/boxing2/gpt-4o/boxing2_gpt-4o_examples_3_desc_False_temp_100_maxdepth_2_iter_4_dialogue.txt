Sure! Below is the Python function to predict the winner of a boxing round based on the specified features. The function also returns the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 3.5
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        if X["Judge"] <= 7.5:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes_truth = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Example output: Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes_truth}")  # Example output: Nodes truth values: [True, False]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` checks if the `Judge`'s encoded label is 3.5 or less.
- `nodes[1]` checks if the `Official` judge is `0.5` (indicating `no`).

Based on the conditions in the decision tree:

- If the `Judge` label is `3.5` or less:
  - If it's not an Official judge (`<= 0.5`), then Trinidad wins.
  - If it is an Official judge (`> 0.5`), then de la Hoya wins.
- If the `Judge` label is more than `3.5`:
  - If it's `7.5` or less, then Trinidad wins.
  - If it's more than `7.5`, then de la Hoya wins.

This function allows you to input the features as a dictionary and outputs the predicted winner along with the list of Boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
