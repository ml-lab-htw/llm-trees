Here is the Python function that implements your decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. The function returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won the round.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values with the following keys:
        - 'Judge': Judge (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
                   4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 
                   7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 
                   9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
        - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': Round (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): The predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge

    if nodes[0]:  # Judge = HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Judge != HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge = Yes
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Official judge = No
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where:
   - `'Judge'` is an integer representing the judge.
   - `'Official'` is a binary value (1 for yes, 0 for no).
   - `'Round'` is an integer between 1 and 12 (not used in this tree since the decision tree doesn't split based on the round).

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`X["Judge"] == 3`).
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).

3. **Decision Tree**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is true (Judge = HBO-Lederman), the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).
   - If `nodes[0]` is false, the function checks `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is true (Official judge = Yes), the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya).
     - Otherwise, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns a tuple containing:
     - `prediction`: The predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`True` or `False`) corresponding to the conditions of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}

# Predict winner
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]
```

---

### Another Example:
```python
# Example input
X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 8}

# Predict winner
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]
```
