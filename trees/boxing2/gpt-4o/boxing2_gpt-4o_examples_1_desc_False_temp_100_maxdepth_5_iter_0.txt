Here is a decision tree classifier based on the Features you provided (Judge, Official, and Round) and the Target variable (which fighter won the round, Trinidad or de la Hoya). The decision tree has a maximum depth of 5, as requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # First inner node: Is the round greater than 6?
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    # Second inner node: Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Third inner node: Is the judge from USA Today or Associated Press?
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [6, 7]
    
    # Fourth inner node: Is the round greater than 9?
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    # Fifth inner node: Is the judge G. Hamada or HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] in [0, 3]
    
    # Root condition
    if nodes[0]:  # Round > 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Official == 1
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge in USA Today or Associated Press
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 9
                    if nodes[4]:  # Judge is G. Hamada or HBO-Lederman
                        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:  # Judge in USA Today or Associated Press
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
1. **nodes[0]** checks if the round is greater than 6. This helps determine the context of the fight (early rounds vs. late rounds).
2. **nodes[1]** checks if the judge is an official judge (this could influence the decision-making process).
3. **nodes[2]** checks if the judge is from USA Today or Associated Press, who may have different scoring tendencies.
4. **nodes[3]** checks if the round is greater than 9, further refining the decision for later rounds.
5. **nodes[4]** checks if the judge is G. Hamada or HBO-Lederman, who may be more inclined to score for a particular fighter.

### Prediction:
- The function returns two values:
  1. **prediction**: Either 0 (Trinidad won the round) or 1 (de la Hoya won the round).
  2. **nodes**: A list of truth values corresponding to each inner node's condition (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise). This list helps in understanding which conditions the prediction was based on.
