Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree for the boxing round winner classification problem, formatted as requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which fighter won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) based on the given features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - "Judge" (int): Judge (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
          4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 
          7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 
          10 = van de Wiele)
        - "Official" (int): Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - "Round" (int): Round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): The predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = condition not satisfied) 
          for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if Judge is one of the judges favoring Trinidad
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  # HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is in the first group
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If Judge is in the second group
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is official
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If the judge is not official
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first decision is based on whether the judge is in the group that tends to favor Trinidad. Judges in this group are `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which correspond to:
   - HBO-Lederman
   - Sportsticker
   - Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
   - USA Today
   - Associated Press
   - Las Vegas Review-Journal
   If the judge is in this group, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).

2. **Node 1**: If the judge is not in the first group, we check whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`). If the judge is official, the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya). Otherwise, the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example 1: Judge = HBO-Lederman, Official = Yes, Round = 5
features = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [1, None]

# Example 2: Judge = G. Hamada, Official = Yes, Round = 10
features = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0, 1]

# Example 3: Judge = G. Hamada, Official = No, Round = 3
features = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 0, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [0, 0]
```

### Notes:
- The `Round` feature is not used in the decision tree since the tree has a maximum depth of 2 and "Judge" and "Official" were deemed the most important features.
- The `nodes` list captures the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes[0]`: Whether the judge is in the group favoring Trinidad.
  - `nodes[1]`: Whether the judge is an official judge (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`).
