```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the truth value list for the nodes
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Node conditions based on decision splits
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Assume we first split on whether the judge is G. Hamada
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Then split on whether the judge is an official judge or not
    
    # Decision tree logic using the conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is G. Hamada
        if nodes[1]:  # If Official is yes
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If Judge is not G. Hamada
        if X["Round"] <= 6:  # Use Round as the next split condition
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {
    "Judge": 0,       # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print(f"Prediction: {'Trinidad' if prediction == 0 else 'de la Hoya'}")
print(f"Node conditions: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]:** This checks if the "Judge" is G. Hamada (`Judge == 0`).
2. **nodes[1]:** This checks if the "Official" is Yes (`Official == 1`).

### Logic within the function:
- If **Judge** is G. Hamada, then it further checks:
  - If the judge is an **Official** (Yes), predicting Trinidad.
  - If the judge is not an **Official** (No), predicting de la Hoya.

- If **Judge** is not G. Hamada, it checks the **Round**:
  - If the **Round** is less than or equal to 6, predicting de la Hoya.
  - If the **Round** is greater than 6, predicting Trinidad.

Feel free to replace the heuristic values with derived meaningful thresholds from your dataset for higher fidelity if you have more data insights.
