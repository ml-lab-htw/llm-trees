Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier based on the features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Split based on whether the judge is an official judge or not
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If official judge
        # Node 1: Judge split for official judges
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada (0 = G. Hamada)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Round split for G. Hamada
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 8
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # Node 3: Judge == B. Logist (1 = B. Logist)
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1
            
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 4: Round split for B. Logist
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 5
                
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                # Node 5: Judge == J. Roth (2 = J. Roth)
                nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 2
                
                if nodes[5]:
                    # Node 6: Round split for J. Roth
                    nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 6
                    
                    if nodes[6]:
                        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Default: Trinidad for other official judges
    else:  # Non-official judge
        # Node 1: Judge split for non-official judges (HBO-Lederman)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Judge == HBO-Lederman
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Round split for HBO-Lederman
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 4
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # Node 3: Judge == Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami)
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 5
            
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 4: Round split for Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 8
                
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                # Node 5: Judge == USA Today (6 = USA Today)
                nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 6
                
                if nodes[5]:
                    # Node 6: Round split for USA Today
                    nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 6
                    
                    if nodes[6]:
                        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Default: Trinidad for other non-official judges
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function takes input `X`, which is a dictionary containing the features (keys: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`).
- The list `nodes` keeps track of which nodes in the decision tree are visited, storing `True` (1) or `False` (0) for each condition.
- The tree structure follows the same logic as the decision tree you provided, with the appropriate thresholds added based on the round number and judge.
- The function returns:
  - The **prediction** (`0` for Trinidad, `1` for de la Hoya).
  - The **nodes list**, which represents the truth values of the inner nodes (whether each condition was satisfied or not).

### Example usage:
```python
X_input = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 9}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output:
```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True, True, False, None, None, None, None]
```

This indicates that the classifier predicts Trinidad as the winner of the round, and the first three nodes in the tree were reached based on the input conditions.
