Based on the outlined features and decision tree structure, we can implement the decision tree prediction with truth values as follows:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 10  # This will hold the truth values of the nodes

    # Evaluate the conditions for each split in the tree
    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] == 0)  # G. Hamada
    nodes[1] = (X["Official"] == 1) if nodes[0] else None
    nodes[2] = (X["Round"] <= 6) if nodes[1] else None 

    nodes[3] = (X["Judge"] == 1)  # B. Logist

    nodes[4] = (X["Judge"] == 2)  # J. Roth
    nodes[5] = (X["Round"] <= 5) if nodes[4] else None

    nodes[6] = (X["Judge"] == 3)  # HBO-Lederman

    nodes[7] = (X["Judge"] == 4)  # Sportsticker
    nodes[8] = (X["Official"] == 1) if nodes[7] else None
    nodes[9] = (X["Round"] <= 4) if nodes[8] else None

    # Make the prediction based on the evaluated tree
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge = G. Hamada
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge = yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif nodes[3]:  # Judge = B. Logist
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif nodes[4]:  # Judge = J. Roth
        if nodes[5]:  # Round <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif nodes[6]:  # Judge = HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[7]:  # Judge = Sportsticker
        if nodes[8]:  # Official judge = yes
            if nodes[9]:  # Round <= 4
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # Judge = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif X["Judge"] == 6:  # Judge = USA Today
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Judge = Associated Press
        if X["Official"] == 1:  # Official judge = yes
            if X["Round"] <= 3:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif X["Judge"] == 8:  # Judge = Las Vegas Review-Journal
        if X["Official"] == 1:  # Official judge = yes
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif X["Judge"] == 9:  # Judge = Los Angeles Times-Springer
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    elif X["Judge"] == 10:  # Judge = van de Wiele
        if X["Official"] == 1:  # Official judge = yes
            if X["Round"] <= 2:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = None  # No prediction is made for unrecognized judges

    # Fill unused nodes with False to keep the list structure consistent
    for i in range(len(nodes)):
        if nodes[i] is None:
            nodes[i] = False

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function will take a dictionary `X` with the keys `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`, and returns a tuple containing the prediction and a list of truth values representing the conditions at each internal node of the decision tree. 

Please note that this implementation assumes that the `Judge` values are encoded with integers as described:
```
0 = G. Hamada
1 = B. Logist
2 = J. Roth
3 = HBO-Lederman
4 = Sportsticker
5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
6 = USA Today
7 = Associated Press
8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal
9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer
10 = van de Wiele
```
And the `Official` and `Round` values are as specified:
```
Official: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
Round: 1 to 12
```
