Hereâ€™s a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 based on the new provided features and target variable:

### Features:
- **Judge**: Which judge is scoring the round. (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge or not. (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: Round number in the boxing match (1 to 12)

### Target variable:
- **target**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

### Decision Tree:
Based on the features, we can induce a hypothetical decision tree. Let's assume:
1. Official judges tend to favor de la Hoya.
2. Judges like "J. Roth" and "B. Logist" favor de la Hoya.
3. In earlier rounds (e.g., Rounds 1-6), "J. Roth" tends to favor de la Hoya more than in later rounds.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Inner Node 2: Check if the judge is J. Roth (Judge 2) or B. Logist (Judge 1)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [1, 2]
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya favored
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad favored
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Non-official judges favor Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`). If the judge is official, we move to the next check.
- **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is either "J. Roth" (Judge 2) or "B. Logist" (Judge 1). If either of these judges is scoring the round, de la Hoya (1) is predicted as the winner. Otherwise, Trinidad (0) is predicted.
- If the judge is not official (i.e., `Official == 0`), Trinidad is predicted as the winner.

This decision tree is an example of how you might induce a tree based on the features you provided without training it on real data.
