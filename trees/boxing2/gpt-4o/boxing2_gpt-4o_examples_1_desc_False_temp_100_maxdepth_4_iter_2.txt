Given the Features and target variable, hereâ€™s a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4, formatted as a Python function. This function will return both a prediction and a list representing the truth values of the conditions tested at each node.

### Features:
- `Judge`: The judge who scored the round (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, ..., 10 = van de Wiele)
- `Official`: Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `Round`: The round number (1 to 12)

### Target:
- `target`: Which fighter won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

### Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # First decision based on Judge ID
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is an official
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Check if the round number is in the first half of the match
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Specific check for a particular judge (HBO-Lederman)

    if nodes[0]:  # Judge ID <= 5
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                if nodes[3]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:  # Round > 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:  # Not an official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:  # Judge ID > 5
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            if nodes[3]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: Checks if the judge ID is less than or equal to 5 (the first half of the judges).
- **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is an official judge.
- **Node 2**: Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (the first half of the match).
- **Node 3**: A specific check for judge HBO-Lederman (Judge ID = 3).

This decision tree will return a prediction of whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round based on the values of the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`. Additionally, it will return a list of 1s and 0s indicating which conditions in the decision tree were met.
