Let's create the specific Python function to predict which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / de la Hoya) won each round based on the features provided (`Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`). We're going to follow a decision tree similar to the one described before and include the condition nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        # Check if HBO-Lederman gave a score <= 6 (let's assume we're checking up to the halfway point)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3 and X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:  # Is an official judge
        # Check if the judge is G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), or J. Roth (2)
        nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
        if nodes[2]:
            # Check if the round is <= 6
            nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:  # Other official judges
            # Check if the round is <= 6
            nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 8}
# prediction, nodes = predict(X)
# print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected output: 0 (Trinidad), based on the decision tree logic
# print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Expected output: [1, None, 1, 0, None]
```

#### Explanation:
1. **nodes[0]**: Checks if the `Official` judge value is 1 (Yes).
2. **nodes[1]**: Used if the judge is not an official judge. Specifically checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`Judge` == 3) and the round is <= 6.
3. **nodes[2]**: Checks if the judge is one of G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), or J. Roth (2).
4. **nodes[3]**: Used if the judge is one of G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth. Checks if the round is <= 6.
5. **nodes[4]**: Used if the judge is other than the three previously mentioned judges but still an official. Checks if the round is <= 6.

The function will traverse the decision tree, evaluate the conditions on the nodes, and return the prediction along with the truth values for each node used in the decision-making process.
