Here is the requested Python function implementing the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. It includes the condition evaluations as a list (`nodes`) and returns the prediction alongside the list:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict which fighter won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
    based on the decision tree rules.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the feature values.
                  Keys: ['Judge', 'Official', 'Round']

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
               prediction: 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya
               nodes: List of truth values (1 or 0) for inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 8 * [None]  # 8 inner nodes in this decision tree

    # Inner node evaluations
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 6]  # Judge is G. Hamada, J. Roth, or USA Today
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [1, 10]  # Judge is B. Logist or van de Wiele
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 4  # Round number is less than or equal to 4
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 5]  # Judge is HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 5  # Round number is less than or equal to 5
    nodes[7] = X["Judge"] in [7, 8, 9]  # Judge is Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, or Los Angeles Times-Springer

    # Decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge?
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is G. Hamada, J. Roth, or USA Today
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:  # Round > 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif nodes[3]:  # Judge is B. Logist or van de Wiele
            if nodes[4]:  # Round <= 4
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 4
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Default to Trinidad (to handle edge cases)
    else:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[5]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, or Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
            if nodes[6]:  # Round <= 5
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 5
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        elif nodes[7]:  # Judge is Associated Press, Las Vegas Review-Journal, or Los Angeles Times-Springer
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Default to de la Hoya (to handle edge cases)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### How it Works:
1. **Input**:
   - The function takes as input a dictionary (`X`) with the specified keys:
     - `X["Judge"]`: Encoded integer for the judge.
     - `X["Official"]`: Encoded binary value indicating if the judge is official.
     - `X["Round"]`: Integer value for the round number (1 to 12).
2. **Nodes**:
   - Each inner decision (comparison) is evaluated and stored in the list `nodes`, where `1` means the condition is satisfied and `0` means it isnâ€™t.
   - For example, `nodes[0]` evaluates if the judge is an official (`X["Official"] == 1`).
3. **Tree**:
   - The decision tree structure is implemented as nested `if-else` statements.
   - Depending on the input feature values, the program traverses the tree and makes a prediction (`0` for Trinidad, `1` for de la Hoya).
4. **Output**:
   - The function returns:
     - `prediction`: The class label (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).
     - `nodes`: A list of truth values representing the evaluations of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input: Judge is G. Hamada (0), Official judge (1), Round 3
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Outputs truth evaluations: [1, 1, 1, None, None, None, None, None]
```

This implementation generalizes well for various scenarios related to the decision tree conditions.
