Below is a decision tree classifier based on the Features you provided, with a maximum depth of 5. The tree uses conditions based on the features "Judge," "Official," and "Round." The model predicts the winner of the round between Trinidad (0) and de la Hoya (1).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of the first 5 judges (arbitrary selection)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 4
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if the judge is official
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Check if the judge is one of the first 3 judges
                nodes[3] = X["Judge"] <= 2
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    # Node 4: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 3
                    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 3
                    
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the round number is greater than 9
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 9
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the judge is one of the last 5 judges
            nodes[2] = X["Judge"] >= 7
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The first split is based on whether the round number is less than or equal to 6.
2. **Node 1**: Based on whether the judge index is less than or equal to 4 (arbitrary grouping of judges).
3. **Node 2**: If the judge is official or not (`Official == 1`).
4. **Node 3**: If the judge is one of the first three judges.
5. **Node 4**: If the round number is less than or equal to 3.

### Sample Input:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 1,   # Judge "B. Logist"
    "Official": 1,  # Official judge
    "Round": 4     # Round number 4
}
```

### Sample Output:
```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya wins)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True, True, True, False]
```

- In this example, de la Hoya wins the round based on the decision tree's logic, and the conditions of the nodes are shown in the `nodes` list.

This decision tree can be adjusted based on the real-world data or additional insights into the judges and rounds, but this is a simple hypothetical model based on arbitrary splits.
