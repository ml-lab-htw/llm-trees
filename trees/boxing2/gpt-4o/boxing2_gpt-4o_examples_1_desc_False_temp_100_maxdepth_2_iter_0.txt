Here's a decision tree of maximum depth 2 based on the Features you provided:

### Features:
- **Judge**: The judge who scored the round. (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele)
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge or not. (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: The round number of the boxing match (1 to 12).

### Target Variable:
- **target**: Which fighter won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

### Decision Tree:
Based on the structure you requested, here is the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features for prediction:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 1: If the judge is official, check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            # Early rounds (Round 1 to 6): Predict de la Hoya wins
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # Later rounds (Round 7 to 12): Predict Trinidad wins
            prediction = 0
    else:
        # If the judge is not official, base decision on the judge's ID
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 3]  # Favoring judges 0 (G. Hamada), 1 (B. Logist), and 3 (HBO-Lederman)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Favor de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Favor Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The first inner node checks if the judge is official (`Official == 1`). This decision can influence the prediction.
2. **Node 1**:
    - If the judge is official, the decision depends on the round number (`Round <= 6`). This node assumes that the official judges might favor de la Hoya in the earlier rounds (1-6), while Trinidad might be favored in the later rounds (7-12).
    - If the judge is not official, the decision is influenced by the judge's ID. Judges with IDs 0, 1, or 3 are assumed to favor de la Hoya, while others favor Trinidad.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 2,         # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,      # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 4          # Round 4
}

# Call the predict function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (de la Hoya)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, True]
```

This decision tree is simple but captures some logical splits based on the features you provided.
