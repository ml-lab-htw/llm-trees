Below is the implementation of the decision tree as a Python function that returns a prediction (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - "Judge" (int): 0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker,
                         5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 
                         8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele
        - "Official" (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
        - "Round" (int): 1 to 12

    Returns:
    tuple:
        - prediction (int): 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """

    # Initialize the nodes list with None for each inner node
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Define the conditions for the decision tree's inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Is the Judge HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is the judge an official judge?

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    else:  # If Judge is not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is an official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `X` is a dictionary containing the features: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
   - `Judge` is encoded as integers (0 to 10) based on the mapping provided.
   - `Official` is a binary variable (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
   - `Round` ranges from 1 to 12, but it is not used in this decision tree since it was not deemed important for splitting.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`Judge == 3`).
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).

3. **Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., Judge is HBO-Lederman), the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).
   - Otherwise, it checks `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True` (i.e., the judge is an official judge), the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya).
     - If `nodes[1]` is `False` (i.e., the judge is not an official judge), the prediction is `0` (Trinidad).

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the prediction (`0` or `1`) and the list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`).
