Here's a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 1, based on the Features and the new prediction target.

### Features:
- **Judge**: Identifier of the judge who scored the round (0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele).
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Round**: The round in which the score is being given (from 1 to 12).

### Target Variable:
- **target**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya).

### Decision Tree:
Given that we need to build a tree with a maximum depth of 1, we will select the most important feature and create a single decision node. Here, we will use the `Judge` feature to make the decision (since different judges might have biases or scoring tendencies).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Decision node: Judge
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # Judges with IDs 0 to 5 might tend to favor Trinidad, others de la Hoya
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree checks the `Judge` feature to decide the outcome.
- If the judge is one of the first 6 (IDs 0 to 5), the tree predicts that Trinidad won the round.
- Otherwise, it predicts that de la Hoya won the round.
- The `nodes` list contains a single boolean value, indicating whether the condition in the decision node was satisfied (`1` for True, `0` for False).
