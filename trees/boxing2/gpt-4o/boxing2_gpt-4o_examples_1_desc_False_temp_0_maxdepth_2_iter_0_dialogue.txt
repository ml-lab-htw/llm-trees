Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the boxing match features you provided. The function predicts which fighter won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and returns a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on the decision tree.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - "Judge" (int): 0 = G. Hamada, 1 = B. Logist, 2 = J. Roth, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker,
                        5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today, 7 = Associated Press,
                        8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer, 10 = van de Wiele
        - "Official" (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
        - "Round" (int): 1 to 12

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction (int): 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the judge HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Node 1: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If Judge is not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is an official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # Not an official judge
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, False]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0** checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`X["Judge"] == 3`). If true, the prediction is **Trinidad (0)**.
2. If **Node 0** is false, **Node 1** checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
   - If true, the prediction is **de la Hoya (1)**.
   - If false, the prediction is **Trinidad (0)**.

This function adheres to the decision tree structure and provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.
