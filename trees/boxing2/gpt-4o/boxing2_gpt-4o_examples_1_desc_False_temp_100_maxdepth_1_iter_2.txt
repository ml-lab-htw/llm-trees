Based on the Features and target variable, I will now create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. Since we are limited to one inner node, we will use the most relevant feature for prediction. Given the context of a boxing match, I will hypothesize that the **Judge** is the most important feature, as different judges may have different scoring tendencies.

Hereâ€™s the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Inner node based on the most relevant feature: Judge
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Assuming Judges 0-4 are more likely to favor Trinidad
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree evaluates the feature `Judge`. Here, I have set the condition `X["Judge"] <= 4`, which implies that judges 0 to 4 (based on the given range) might be more likely to score the round in favor of Trinidad, while judges with an index greater than 4 might favor de la Hoya.
- If the condition is true (`Judge <= 4`), the prediction is 0 (Trinidad wins the round).
- If the condition is false (`Judge > 4`), the prediction is 1 (de la Hoya wins the round).
