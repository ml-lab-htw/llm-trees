```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Since we only have one decision node in a depth-1 tree

    # Decision node: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official = 1 means the judge is an official judge

    # Prediction based on the single decision node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins if the judge is official
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins if the judge is not official

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree makes a single decision based on whether the judge is an official or not (i.e., `X["Official"] == 1`).
- The list `nodes` contains the truth value of this condition. If the condition is satisfied (`X["Official"] == 1`), the value of `nodes[0]` is `True` (or `1`), meaning the judge is official.
- The prediction is:
  - **1 (de la Hoya)** if the judge is an official.
  - **0 (Trinidad)** if the judge is not an official.
