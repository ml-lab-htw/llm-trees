Given the full problem setup and example formats, let's create a similar function for the decision tree classifier based on the given features for predicting boxing round winners between Trinidad and de la Hoya.

We will use a 2-level decision tree for our `Judge` and `Round` features as specified. Here is the function in Python:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    ## Converting Judge names to respective encoded values for comparison
    judges = {
        'G. Hamada': 0,
        'B. Logist': 1,
        'J. Roth': 2,
        'HBO-Lederman': 3,
        'Sportsticker': 4,
        'Los Angeles Times-Kawakami': 5,
        'USA Today': 6,
        'Associated Press': 7,
        'Las Vegas Review-Journal': 8,
        'Los Angeles Times-Springer': 9,
        'van de Wiele': 10
    }
    
    # Translate judge name in X to corresponding coded value
    judge = judges.get(X["Judge"], -1)
    round = X["Round"]
    
    # Initial decision boundary set for each binary branching
    nodes[0] = judge == 0 or judge == 10  # (G. Hamada or van de Wiele)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = round <= 6  # for judge G. Hamada or round <= 8 for judge van de Wiele
        if judge == 0:
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif judge == 10:
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        nodes[1] = judge in [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]  # (B. Logist, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, USA Today, Las Vegas Review-Journal)
        
        if nodes[1]:
            if judge == 1:
                prediction = 0 if round <= 5 else 1  # Trinidad if round <= 5 else de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya, covers judges J. Roth, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times-Springer
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X = {
    "Judge": "G. Hamada",
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 7
}
print(predict(X))  # Output: (1, [True, False])
```

With this function:
- `nodes[0]` checks if the judge is G. Hamada or van de Wiele (since the most significant branching occurs here);
- `nodes[1]` splits based on the round number for G. Hamada or determines the group of other key judges.

Different handling is established for judge-specific decision boundaries and round numbers for specific judges. This is a simplified model, assuming the judges' evaluations and rounds are highly deterministic, and without access to real data, guesses are filled meaningfully based on the original constraints described.
