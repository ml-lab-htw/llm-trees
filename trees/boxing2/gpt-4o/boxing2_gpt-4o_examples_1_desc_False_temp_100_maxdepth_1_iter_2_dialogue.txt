```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of truth values for the inner nodes
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check which judge is making the decision (Judge)
    # We will classify based on the judge's historical tendencies
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9]  # Judges who tend to favor de la Hoya

    # Evaluate the decision tree based on the node outcomes
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Judge** is the most important feature, so the single inner node (node 0) checks if the judge is one of those who historically tend to score rounds for **de la Hoya**.
- Judges who tend to favor **de la Hoya** are: G. Hamada (0), J. Roth (2), HBO-Lederman (3), Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (5), USA Today (6), Associated Press (7), and Los Angeles Times-Springer (9).
- If the judge is one of these, the prediction is **de la Hoya** (1). Otherwise, the prediction is **Trinidad** (0).
- The function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes. In this case, since the tree has only one decision node, the list contains a single element (`nodes[0]`).
