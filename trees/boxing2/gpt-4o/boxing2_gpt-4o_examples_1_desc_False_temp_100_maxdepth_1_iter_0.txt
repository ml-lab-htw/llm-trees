Sure! Based on the Features and the target variable, I will generate a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. Since you want a decision tree with between 1 and 1 inner node, I will pick the most important feature from the provided features to split on.

Features:
- Judge: Judge involved in scoring the boxing match (0-10)
- Official: Whether the judge is an official judge or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Round: The round in the fight (1 to 12)

Target variable:
- Target: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

For simplicity, let's say the most important feature for this decision tree is `Judge`. I'll create a decision tree based on whether the `Judge` is less than or equal to 5 (indicating a certain set of judges, for example).

Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins the round
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
- The decision tree splits on the feature `Judge`. If the value of `Judge` is less than or equal to 5, it predicts that Trinidad wins the round (prediction = 0). Otherwise, it predicts that de la Hoya wins the round (prediction = 1).
- The function also returns a list `nodes`, where each entry represents whether the condition for the corresponding inner node was satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false). In this case, there is only one inner node.
