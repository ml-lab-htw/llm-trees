```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Round'] <= 6 else 0  # Condition at the root node

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'Round'`: Ranging from 1 to 12.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: Trinidad
  - `1`: de la Hoya

- **Decision Tree Logic:**

  - **Node 0 (Root Node):**
    - **Condition:** `Round <= 6`
    - **Truth Value:** Stored in `nodes[0]`
      - `1` if the condition is satisfied (`Round` is 6 or less).
      - `0` if the condition is not satisfied (`Round` is greater than 6).

- **Prediction Logic:**

  - **If** `nodes[0] == 1` (The condition `Round <= 6` is true):
    - **Prediction:** `1` (de la Hoya won the round)
  
  - **Else** (The condition `Round <= 6` is false):
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad won the round)

- **Return Values:**

  - `prediction`: The predicted class label (`0` or `1`).
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values (`1` or `0`) of the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where Round is 5
X_example = {
    'Judge': 2,     # J. Roth (irrelevant in this tree)
    'Official': 1,  # Yes (irrelevant in this tree)
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

**Notes:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes of the decision tree.
  - Each entry is `1` if the corresponding condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

- **Depth of the Tree:**
  - The decision tree has a maximum depth of **2**:
    - **Depth 1:** Root node with the condition on `Round`.
    - **Depth 2:** Leaf nodes representing the class predictions.

- **Feature Importance:**
  - The `Round` feature is used as it is the most significant in determining the winner of each round based on the fight dynamics.

**Assumptions:**

- The features `'Judge'` and `'Official'` are not used in this specific tree due to the depth constraint and their lesser importance in this model.
- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` includes the key `'Round'` with an integer value between 1 and 12.
