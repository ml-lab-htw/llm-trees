Certainly! Based on the features you've provided and the decision tree specifications, here's the Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Decision Tree Structure (Maximum Depth 2):**

- **Node 0 (Root Node):** `Official` judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - If **Official == 1 (Yes)**:
    - **Node 1:** `Round` ≤ 6
      - If **Round ≤ 6**:
        - **Prediction:** de la Hoya (1)
      - Else:
        - **Prediction:** Trinidad (0)
  - Else (**Official == 0 (No)**):
    - **Prediction:** de la Hoya (1)

**Function Implementation:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # Node 1 is not evaluated when Official == 0
        nodes[1] = None
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
    - `1` if the condition is satisfied (**Official judge**), `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents whether the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`Round <= 6`).
    - Evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 1`.
    - `1` if the condition is satisfied (Round 1 to 6), `0` otherwise.
    - Set to `None` if `nodes[0] == 0` since this node isn't evaluated.
  
- **Prediction:**
  - **Prediction is `1` (de la Hoya)** in the following cases:
    - If the judge is not an official judge (`Official == 0`).
    - If the judge is official (`Official == 1`) and the round is 6 or earlier (`Round <= 6`).
  - **Prediction is `0` (Trinidad)** when:
    - The judge is official (`Official == 1`) and the round is after 6 (`Round > 6`).

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **'Judge'**: Judge identifier (not used in this tree).
  - Encoded as:
    - `0`: G. Hamada
    - `1`: B. Logist
    - `2`: J. Roth
    - `3`: HBO-Lederman
    - `4`: Sportsticker
    - `5`: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - `6`: USA Today
    - `7`: Associated Press
    - `8`: Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - `9`: Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - `10`: van de Wiele
- **'Official'**: Whether the judge is an official judge.
  - `1`: Yes (Official judge)
  - `0`: No (Unofficial judge)
- **'Round'**: Round number.
  - Ranges from `1` to `12`.

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: **Trinidad**
- `1`: **de la Hoya**

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Sample input where the judge is official and it's round 5
X_sample = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {'de la Hoya' if prediction == 1 else 'Trinidad'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output:
# Prediction: de la Hoya
# Nodes: [1, 1]

# Sample input where the judge is official and it's round 8
X_sample = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 8}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {'de la Hoya' if prediction == 1 else 'Trinidad'}")
print(f"Nodes: [1, 0]"

# Sample input where the judge is unofficial
X_sample = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {'de la Hoya' if prediction == 1 else 'Trinidad'}")
print(f"Nodes: [0, None]")
```

**Notes:**

- The function strictly uses the provided feature keys and respects their exact spelling and encoding.
- The decision thresholds are meaningful and based on typical boxing scoring patterns.
  - **Round ≤ 6**: Early rounds.
  - **Official judges** are considered in the decision-making process.
- The `nodes` list correctly represents the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
  - `None` if the node is not evaluated (e.g., when the path doesn't reach that node).

**Final Thoughts:**

This function provides a simple yet meaningful prediction based on the provided features and the induced decision tree. It respects all the specified requirements, including the maximum depth of the tree, feature keys, encodings, and the format of the output.
