Certainly! Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

---

**Features**:

- `Judge`: Judge (encoded as follows)
  - 0 = G. Hamada
  - 1 = B. Logist
  - 2 = J. Roth
  - 3 = HBO-Lederman
  - 4 = Sportsticker
  - 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - 6 = USA Today
  - 7 = Associated Press
  - 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - 10 = van de Wiele

- `Official`: Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - Official judges are: G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), J. Roth (2)
  - Unofficial judges are encoded from 3 to 10

- `Round`: Round number (1 to 12)

**Target Variable**:

- `target`: Which of the two boxing fighters won each round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = De La Hoya)

---

**Python Function**:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = int(X["Round"] <= 6)  # Node 0 condition: Round <= 6
    nodes[1] = int(X["Official"] == 1)  # Node 1 condition: Official == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Round <= 6
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:
        # If Round > 6
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # If Unofficial judge
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    return prediction, nodes
```

---

**Explanation**:

- **Node Conditions**:
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Rounds 1-6).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge.

- **Decision Logic**:
  - **First Layer** (`nodes[0]`):
    - If the **Round** is **less than or equal to 6**:
      - Predict **De La Hoya** (encoded as **1**).
  - **Second Layer** (when `nodes[0]` is **False**):
    - If the **Round** is **greater than 6**:
      - **Second Node** (`nodes[1]`):
        - If **Official** judge (`Official == 1`):
          - Predict **Trinidad** (encoded as **0**).
        - Else:
          - Predict **De La Hoya** (encoded as **1**).

**Usage Example**:

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,       # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 8        # Round 8
}
```

Using the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")       # Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")                 # Output: Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Interpretation**:

- `nodes[0]` is **0** because `Round` is **8**, which is **not less than or equal to 6**.
- `nodes[1]` is **1** because `Official` is **1** (Yes).
- Since `nodes[0]` is **False** (`0`), we proceed to check `nodes[1]`.
  - `nodes[1]` is **True** (`1`), so we predict **Trinidad** (encoded as **0**).

---

**Notes**:

- The function strictly adheres to the provided feature keys and encodings.
- The list `nodes` contains integers `1` (True) or `0` (False), representing whether each node's condition is satisfied.
- The decision tree uses a maximum depth of **2**, utilizing the most important features (`Round` and `Official`).
- Thresholds are filled with meaningful values based on the context of the fight.

---

**Understanding the Decision Tree in Context**:

- **Early Rounds (1-6)**:
  - De La Hoya was generally perceived to have won the early rounds.
  - The model predicts **De La Hoya** as the winner for these rounds.

- **Later Rounds (7-12)**:
  - Trinidad was seen as stronger in the later rounds.
  - For **Official judges**, the model predicts **Trinidad**.
  - For **Unofficial judges**, the model predicts **De La Hoya**:
    - Unofficial judges may have different scoring criteria or biases.

---

**Example with Unofficial Judge**:

```python
X_example_unofficial = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # No
    "Round": 9        # Round 9
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example_unofficial)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")       # Output: Prediction: 1 (De La Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")                 # Output: Nodes: [0, 0]
```

- `nodes[0]`: **0** because `Round` **9** is not <= **6**.
- `nodes[1]`: **0** because `Official` is **0** (No).
- Prediction is **De La Hoya** (1) because both conditions are not satisfied for predicting **Trinidad**.

This function provides a simple yet effective way to predict the winner of each round based on the most significant features, while adhering to the maximum depth constraint and using meaningful thresholds.
