Here is the decision tree formatted as a Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 1
    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**
  - `'Judge'`: Integer encoding of the judge names (0 to 10):
    - 0 = G. Hamada
    - 1 = B. Logist
    - 2 = J. Roth
    - 3 = HBO-Lederman
    - 4 = Sportsticker
    - 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - 6 = USA Today
    - 7 = Associated Press
    - 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - 10 = van de Wiele
  - `'Official'`: Indicates if the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - `'Round'`: The round number (1 to 12)

- **Target variable:**
  - Represents which of the two boxing fighters won the round:
    - `0` = Trinidad
    - `1` = de la Hoya

- **Function Details:**
  - The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features.
  - It initializes a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - **Node 0 Condition:** `X["Official"] == 1`
    - This checks if the judge is an official judge.
    - `nodes[0]` will be `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
  - Based on the truth value of `nodes[0]`, the function assigns the `prediction`:
    - If `nodes[0] == 1` (Official judge), predicts `0` (Trinidad).
    - If `nodes[0] == 0` (Not an official judge), predicts `1` (de la Hoya).
  - The function returns the `prediction` and the list `nodes`.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 0,      # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 5
}
```

Calling the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

In this case:

- Since `Official` is `1`, `nodes[0]` is `1`.
- The prediction is `0`, indicating that Trinidad is predicted to have won the round.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the feature values provided to the function match the exact keys and encoding specified.
- The `nodes` list contains `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
