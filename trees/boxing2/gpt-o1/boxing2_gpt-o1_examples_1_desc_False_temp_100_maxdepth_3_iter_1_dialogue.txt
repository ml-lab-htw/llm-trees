Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier you provided. This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features, and returns a prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes. The entries in the `nodes` list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]  # Initialize the list for truth values of two inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if Round <= 6
    nodes[0] = int(X["Round"] <= 6)
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Round <= 6, predict "de la Hoya" (encoded as 1)
        prediction = 1
        # Since the second condition is not evaluated, we set its value to 0
        nodes[1] = 0
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Official judge == yes (encoded as 1)
        nodes[1] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Official judge == yes, predict "Trinidad" (encoded as 0)
            prediction = 0
        else:
            # If Official judge != yes, predict "de la Hoya" (encoded as 1)
            prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - **Round**: The current round number (1 to 12).
  - **Official**: Indicates if the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if `Round <= 6`.
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), predicts **"de la Hoya"** (1).
     - If **No** (`nodes[0] = 0`), proceeds to the next condition.
  2. **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): Checks if `Official == 1` (Official judge is "Yes").
     - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), predicts **"Trinidad"** (0).
     - If **No** (`nodes[1] = 0`), predicts **"de la Hoya"** (1).

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Truth value of the first condition (`Round <= 6`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Truth value of the second condition (`Official == 1`).
    - If the second condition is not evaluated (because the first condition was true), we set `nodes[1]` to `0` to indicate that the condition was not satisfied.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    "Judge": 2,       # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 7        # Round 7
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Note:** Ensure that the feature values in the input dictionary `X` match the expected encoding provided:

- **Judge Encoding:**
  - `0` = G. Hamada
  - `1` = B. Logist
  - `2` = J. Roth
  - `3` = HBO-Lederman
  - `4` = Sportsticker
  - `5` = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - `6` = USA Today
  - `7` = Associated Press
  - `8` = Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - `9` = Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - `10` = van de Wiele
- **Official Encoding:**
  - `1` = Yes
  - `0` = No
- **Round Range:** `1` to `12`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0` = Trinidad
- `1` = de la Hoya
