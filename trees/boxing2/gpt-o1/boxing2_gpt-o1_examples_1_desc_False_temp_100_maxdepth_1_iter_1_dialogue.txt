Certainly! Based on the features and target variable you've provided, here's the Python function representing the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is an official judge
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**
  - **Judge:** Encoded as:
    - 0 = G. Hamada
    - 1 = B. Logist
    - 2 = J. Roth
    - 3 = HBO-Lederman
    - 4 = Sportsticker
    - 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - 6 = USA Today
    - 7 = Associated Press
    - 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - 10 = van de Wiele
  - **Official:** Indicates if the judge is an official judge.
    - 1 = Yes
    - 0 = No
  - **Round:** Integer from 1 to 12.

- **Target Variable:**
  - **which of the two boxing fighters won each round**
    - 0 = Trinidad
    - 1 = de la Hoya

**Function Details:**

- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features.
- `nodes` is a list that will hold the truth value of the inner node (since the tree has a maximum depth of 1, there is only one node).
- The condition `X["Official"] == 1` checks if the judge is an official judge.
  - If **True** (`nodes[0] = True` or `1`), the function predicts `0` (Trinidad).
  - If **False** (`nodes[0] = False` or `0`), the function predicts `1` (de la Hoya).
- The function returns the `prediction` and the list `nodes` containing the truth value(s) of the inner node(s).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is an official judge
X_example_official = {
    "Judge": 0,        # G. Hamada
    "Official": 1,     # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

# Example input where the judge is not an official judge
X_example_unofficial = {
    "Judge": 3,        # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,     # No
    "Round": 5
}

# Predict using the function
prediction_official, nodes_official = predict(X_example_official)
prediction_unofficial, nodes_unofficial = predict(X_example_unofficial)

print(f"Official Judge Prediction: {prediction_official}, Nodes: {nodes_official}")
print(f"Unofficial Judge Prediction: {prediction_unofficial}, Nodes: {nodes_unofficial}")
```

**Output:**

```
Official Judge Prediction: 0, Nodes: [1]
Unofficial Judge Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- For **official judges**, the model predicts **Trinidad** as the winner of the round.
- For **unofficial judges**, the model predicts **de la Hoya** as the winner of the round.
- The `nodes` list shows the truth value of the condition:
  - `[1]` means the condition `X["Official"] == 1` is **True**.
  - `[0]` means the condition is **False**.

**Note:**

This decision tree uses the most significant feature, **"Official"**, to make the prediction. Since we are limited to a maximum depth of 1, this simple model captures the primary distinction between the official judges' scores and the unofficial judges/media scores in the Trinidad vs. de la Hoya fight.
