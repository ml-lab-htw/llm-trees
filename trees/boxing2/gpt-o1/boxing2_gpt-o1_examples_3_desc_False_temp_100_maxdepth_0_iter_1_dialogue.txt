Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict(X: dict)` that represents the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer—**Felix Trinidad (0)** or **Oscar de la Hoya (1)**—won each round, based on the features you've provided. The function returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values (`nodes`) representing the truth values of the inner node conditions in the decision tree.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is J. Roth (Judge == 2)
        nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 2

        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if Round <= 5
            nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 5

            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Oscar de la Hoya wins the round
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Felix Trinidad wins the round
        else:
            # Node 3: Check if the judge is G. Hamada (Judge == 0)
            nodes[3] = X['Judge'] == 0
            # Node 4: Check if the judge is B. Logist (Judge == 1)
            nodes[4] = X['Judge'] == 1

            if nodes[3] or nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Felix Trinidad wins the round
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Default to Trinidad (should not occur based on tree)
    else:
        # For non-official judges
        nodes[1] = False  # Not evaluated in this branch
        nodes[2] = False
        nodes[3] = False
        nodes[4] = False

        # Node 5: Check if the judge is in the list favoring de la Hoya
        nodes[5] = X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 1  # Oscar de la Hoya wins the round
        else:
            # Node 6: Check if the judge is van de Wiele (Judge == 10)
            nodes[6] = X['Judge'] == 10

            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 0  # Felix Trinidad wins the round
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Default to Trinidad (should not occur based on tree)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'Judge'`: Encoded as integers from 0 to 10.
  - `'Official'`: 1 for official judges, 0 for unofficial judges.
  - `'Round'`: Round number from 1 to 12.

- **Target Variable:**
  - **0**: Felix Trinidad wins the round.
  - **1**: Oscar de la Hoya wins the round.

- **Decision Tree Structure:**
  1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if the judge is an **official judge**.
     - **Official Judges** (`Official == 1`): G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), J. Roth (2).
     - **Unofficial Judges** (`Official == 0`): All others.
  2. If **official judge**:
     - **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): Checks if the judge is **J. Roth** (`Judge == 2`).
       - If **J. Roth**:
         - **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): Checks if the **Round** is **<= 5**.
           - **Round <= 5**: de la Hoya tends to win early rounds.
           - **Round > 5**: Trinidad tends to win later rounds.
       - If **not J. Roth**:
         - **Node 3** (`nodes[3]`): Checks if the judge is **G. Hamada** (`Judge == 0`).
         - **Node 4** (`nodes[4]`): Checks if the judge is **B. Logist** (`Judge == 1`).
         - Both judges consistently favored **Trinidad**.
  3. If **unofficial judge**:
     - **Node 5** (`nodes[5]`): Checks if the judge is in the list of judges who favored **de la Hoya**.
       - Judges in `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`:

         - 6: USA Today
         - 7: Associated Press
         - 8: Las Vegas Review-Journal
         - 9: Los Angeles Times-Springer
     - **Node 6** (`nodes[6]`): Checks if the judge is **van de Wiele** (`Judge == 10`), who favored **Trinidad**.

### **Usage Example:**

Let's test the function with an example input.

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'Judge': 2,     # J. Roth
    'Official': 1,  # Yes
    'Round': 4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "de la Hoya" if prediction == 1 else "Trinidad")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: de la Hoya
Nodes: [True, True, True, False, False, False, None]
```

- **Explanation:**
  - `nodes[0] = True`: The judge is official.
  - `nodes[1] = True`: The judge is J. Roth.
  - `nodes[2] = True`: Round 4 is <= 5.
  - The prediction is **Oscar de la Hoya** wins the round.

### **Assumptions and Notes:**

- **Judge Encoding:**
  - **0**: G. Hamada
  - **1**: B. Logist
  - **2**: J. Roth
  - **3**: HBO-Lederman
  - **4**: Sportsticker
  - **5**: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - **6**: USA Today
  - **7**: Associated Press
  - **8**: Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - **9**: Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - **10**: van de Wiele
- **Feature Spelling:**
  - Feature keys must match exactly: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, `'Round'`.
- **Prediction Values:**
  - **0**: Felix Trinidad wins the round.
  - **1**: Oscar de la Hoya wins the round.
- **Nodes List:**
  - The `nodes` list contains boolean values corresponding to each condition checked in the decision tree.
  - **Index Mapping:**
    - `nodes[0]`: `X['Official'] == 1`
    - `nodes[1]`: `X['Judge'] == 2`
    - `nodes[2]`: `X['Round'] <= 5`
    - `nodes[3]`: `X['Judge'] == 0`
    - `nodes[4]`: `X['Judge'] == 1`
    - `nodes[5]`: `X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
    - `nodes[6]`: `X['Judge'] == 10`

### **Conclusion:**

This function uses the most significant features—**Judge**, **Official**, and **Round**—to predict which boxer won each round. The inner node conditions (`nodes`) provide a transparent view of the decision-making process at each step of the decision tree.

Feel free to use this function and adjust it based on any additional data or specific requirements you might have.
