**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` to keep track of the truth values of the conditions in the decision tree. Each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied or `0` otherwise.

- **Node 0:** Checks if the judge is an official judge.
  - `nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)`
  - `1` if the judge is official, `0` otherwise.

- **Node 1:** Applies only if the judge is official (`nodes[0] == 1`). Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
  - `nodes[1] = int(nodes[0] and X['Round'] <= 6)`
  - `1` if it's an official judge and the round is 1-6.

- **Node 2:** Applies if the judge is not official (`nodes[0] == 0`). Checks if the judge is among those who favor **de la Hoya**.
  - Judges favoring **de la Hoya** are:
    - HBO-Lederman (`3`)
    - Los Angeles Times-Kawakami (`5`)
    - USA Today (`6`)
    - Associated Press (`7`)
  - `nodes[2] = int((not nodes[0]) and X['Judge'] in [3, 5, 6, 7])`
  - `1` if judge is unofficial and favors **de la Hoya**.

**Decision Logic:**

- **If Official Judge (`nodes[0] == 1`):**
  - **If Round ≤ 6 (`nodes[1] == 1`):**
    - Predict `1` (**de la Hoya** wins the round).
  - **Else (Round ≥ 7):**
    - Predict `0` (**Trinidad** wins the round).

- **Else (Unofficial Judge):**
  - **If Judge Favors de la Hoya (`nodes[2] == 1`):**
    - Predict `1` (**de la Hoya** wins the round).
  - **Else:**
    - Predict `0` (**Trinidad** wins the round).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is an official judge (B. Logist), round 5
X_example = {
    'Judge': 1,       # B. Logist
    'Official': 1,    # Official judge
    'Round': 5        # Round number
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1, 1, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the specified feature keys and target encoding.
- The conditions are designed to reflect meaningful thresholds:
  - **Official Judges** are split based on the round number.
    - Early rounds (1-6) favor **de la Hoya**.
    - Later rounds (7-12) favor **Trinidad**.
  - **Unofficial Judges** are categorized based on whom they favor.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which path was taken in the decision tree.

**Remember:** This decision tree is based on hypothetical or illustrative data. For a real-world application, you'd need actual scoring data to build an accurate model.
