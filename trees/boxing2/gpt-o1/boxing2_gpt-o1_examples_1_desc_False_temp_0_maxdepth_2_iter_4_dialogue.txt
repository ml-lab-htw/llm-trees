def predict(X: dict):

    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
            'Judge': (0-10) - Integer representing the judge.
            'Official': (0, 1) - 1 if official judge, 0 otherwise.
            'Round': (1-12) - The round number.

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 0 if Trinidad wins, 1 if De La Hoya wins.
            nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the truth values
                          of the inner nodes.

This revised code:

* Uses the specified feature names and target encoding.
* Fills in the placeholder thresholds with reasonable values (Round 6 as the dividing line).
* Provides clear comments explaining the logic.
* Includes example usage to demonstrate how the function works.



Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* tree.  The actual splits and predictions would be different with real-world fight data.  You would use a machine learning library to train the tree on your data instead of hardcoding the logic as we've done here for illustration.
