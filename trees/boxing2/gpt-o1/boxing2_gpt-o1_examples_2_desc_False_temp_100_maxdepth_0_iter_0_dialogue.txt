Sure! Based on the decision tree we previously constructed, here's a Python function that predicts which fighter won each round, given the features. The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, with `1` indicating that the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

**Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of nodes (inner nodes in the decision tree)
    nodes = [None] * 2  # We have two inner nodes in the decision tree

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)  # 1 if Official == 1 (Yes), else 0

    # Node 1: Check if the judge is M. van de Wiele
    nodes[1] = int(X['Judge'] == 10)    # 1 if Judge == 10 (M. van de Wiele), else 0

    # Decision logic based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        # If the judge is an official judge
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
    else:
        # If the judge is not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:
            # If the judge is M. van de Wiele
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins the round
        else:
            # For all other judges
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins the round

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `Official == 1` (Is the judge an official judge?)
    - It will be `1` if the condition is satisfied (`Yes`), or `0` otherwise (`No`).
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the condition `Judge == 10` (Is the judge M. van de Wiele?)
    - It will be `1` if the condition is satisfied, or `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (The judge is an official judge):
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad wins the round)
  - **Else:**
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is `1` (The judge is M. van de Wiele):
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad wins the round)
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** `1` (De La Hoya wins the round)

### **Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Features:**
  - `'Judge'`: Encoded as follows:
    - `0` = G. Hamada
    - `1` = B. Lorge
    - `2` = J. Roth
    - `3` = HBO-Lederman
    - `4` = Sportsticker
    - `5` = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - `6` = USA Today
    - `7` = Associated Press
    - `8` = Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - `9` = Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - `10` = M. van de Wiele
  - `'Official'`: Official judge status
    - `1` = Yes
    - `0` = No
  - `'Round'`: Round number (from `1` to `12`) *(Not used in this decision tree)*

- **Target Variable:**
  - `0` = Trinidad
  - `1` = De La Hoya

### **Usage Example:**

**Example 1: Official Judge**

```python
# Input where the judge is an official judge (G. Hamada)
X_example = {
    'Judge': 0,      # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,   # Yes (Official judge)
    'Round': 5       # Round number (unused in this decision tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "De La Hoya")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Trinidad
Nodes: [1, 0]
```

**Explanation:**

- `nodes[0]` is `1` (Official judge is `Yes`), so Trinidad is predicted as the winner.
- `nodes[1]` is `0` (Judge is not M. van de Wiele), but it doesn't affect the prediction in this case.

**Example 2: Unofficial Judge - M. van de Wiele**

```python
# Input where the judge is M. van de Wiele (unofficial)
X_example = {
    'Judge': 10,     # M. van de Wiele
    'Official': 0,   # No (Unofficial judge)
    'Round': 7       # Round number (unused in this decision tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "De La Hoya")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Trinidad
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Explanation:**

- `nodes[0]` is `0` (Official judge is `No`).
- `nodes[1]` is `1` (Judge is M. van de Wiele), so Trinidad is predicted as the winner.

**Example 3: Unofficial Judge - Other**

```python
# Input where the judge is an unofficial judge (HBO-Lederman)
X_example = {
    'Judge': 3,      # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,   # No (Unofficial judge)
    'Round': 10      # Round number (unused in this decision tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "De La Hoya")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: De La Hoya
Nodes: [0, 0]
```

**Explanation:**

- `nodes[0]` is `0` (Official judge is `No`).
- `nodes[1]` is `0` (Judge is not M. van de Wiele).
- Since both conditions are not satisfied, De La Hoya is predicted as the winner.

### **Important Notes:**

- **Feature Use:**
  - While the `'Round'` feature is part of the input, it is **not used** in this decision tree.
  - The decision is made solely based on the `'Official'` and `'Judge'` features.

- **Nodes Evaluation:**
  - All inner nodes are evaluated and their truth values are stored in the `nodes` list, regardless of the prediction path.
  - The `nodes` list helps trace the decision path taken during the prediction.

- **Function Usage:**
  - Ensure the input dictionary `X` contains the exact feature keys: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, `'Round'`.
  - The values must match the encodings provided above.

- **Thresholds and Conditions:**
  - There are no numerical thresholds in this decision tree; conditions are based on exact matches of encoded values.
  - The conditions are filled with the exact values as per the feature encodings provided.

---

### **Understanding the Decision Tree Logic:**

1. **Root Node (`nodes[0]`):**
   - Checks if the judge is an **Official Judge**.
   - If **Yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`), predict **Trinidad** (`prediction = 0`).

2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):**
   - If the judge is **Not an Official Judge** (`nodes[0] = 0`), checks if the judge is **M. van de Wiele**.
   - If **Yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), predict **Trinidad** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If **No** (`nodes[1] = 0`), predict **De La Hoya** (`prediction = 1`).

---

### **Conclusion:**

- This function follows the decision tree that classifies which fighter won each round based on the judge's status and identity.
- By returning both the `prediction` and the `nodes` list, you can understand not only the outcome but also the path taken to reach that decision.
- This implementation adheres strictly to the feature keys, encodings, and the specified format for the decision tree function.
