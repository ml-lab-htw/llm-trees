**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The function now uses the specified feature encodings (e.g., 0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya).
* **Clearer Logic:** The decision tree logic is more explicitly laid out, making it easier to follow the conditions and predictions.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** The threshold for the 'Round' feature is set to 6, reflecting the hypothetical assumption that De La Hoya is stronger in earlier rounds according to official judges.
* **Handles Unofficial Judges:** The `else` condition handles cases where 'Official' is 0 (not an official judge), assigning the win to Trinidad as per our simplified assumption.
* **Returns Nodes:** The function returns the `nodes` list, which stores the truth values of the inner node conditions. This is useful for understanding the path taken through the decision tree for a given input.

This improved function adheres to the specified format, uses the correct feature keys and encoding, and provides a more robust and interpretable implementation of the hypothetical decision tree. Remember, the accuracy of this tree depends entirely on the validity of our initial assumptions, which would need to be validated with real-world data.
