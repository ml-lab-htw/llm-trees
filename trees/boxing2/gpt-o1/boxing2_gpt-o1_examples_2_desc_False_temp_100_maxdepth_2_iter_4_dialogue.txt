Certainly! Based on the provided features and target variable, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

---

**Features:**

- **Judge**: Judge (encoded as integers)
  - 0 = G. Hamada
  - 1 = B. Logist
  - 2 = J. Roth
  - 3 = HBO-Lederman
  - 4 = Sportsticker
  - 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - 6 = USA Today
  - 7 = Associated Press
  - 8 = Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - 9 = Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - 10 = van de Wiele
- **Official**: Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: Round number (1 to 12)

**Target Variable:**

- **Winner**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round
  - 0 = **Trinidad**
  - 1 = **De La Hoya**

### **Decision Tree Function**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    return prediction, nodes
```

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if the **Round** is less than or equal to **6**.
  - **Meaningful Threshold**: The fight consists of 12 rounds, so dividing at round 6 splits the fight into early and later rounds.
- **If `nodes[0]` is `True`**:
  - Rounds **1 to 6** are generally predicted to be won by **De La Hoya** (prediction **1**).
- **Else** (Rounds **7 to 12**):
  - **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): Checks if the **Judge** is an **Official** judge (`Official` == 1).
    - **Meaningful Threshold**: Official judges may have scored rounds differently than unofficial judges.
  - **If `nodes[1]` is `True`**:
    - Predict **Trinidad** as the winner (prediction **0**).
  - **Else**:
    - Predict **De La Hoya** as the winner (prediction **1**).

**Nodes List:**

- `nodes[0]`: `True` if `Round` â‰¤ 6, else `False`.
- `nodes[1]`: Evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `False` (i.e., `Round` > 6).

### **Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following data for a round:

```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 2,       # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 8
}
```

**Predicting:**

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "De La Hoya")
print("Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Trinidad
Nodes Truth Values: [False, True]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Round** 8 (`nodes[0]` is `False` because `8 > 6`).
- **Official** judge (`nodes[1]` is `True`).
- Therefore, **Trinidad** is predicted to have won Round 8.

---

### **Notes:**

- The decision tree uses two features:
  - **Round** number with a threshold at **6** to split early and late rounds.
  - **Official** judge status to determine likely scoring biases in later rounds.
- The function adheres to the specified format:
  - Returns a **prediction** (`0` or `1`).
  - Returns a list of **nodes** containing truth values (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`).
