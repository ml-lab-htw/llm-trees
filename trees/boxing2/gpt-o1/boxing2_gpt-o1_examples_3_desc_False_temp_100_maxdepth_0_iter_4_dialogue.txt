Based on the features you've provided and aiming to build a decision tree classifier that predicts which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad or De La Hoya) won each round, here's a Python function that follows your specifications. The function returns a single prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Nodes represent the conditions at each decision point in the tree
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1                          # Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6                             # Is the round less than or equal to 6?
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2]                     # Is the judge G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth?
    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] == 3                             # Is the judge HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[4] = X['Round'] > 9                              # Is the round greater than 9?
    
    # Decision tree logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round 1-6
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge is G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
        else:  # Round 7-12
            if nodes[3]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Non-official judge
        if nodes[4]:  # Round 10-12
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Decision Tree:**

- **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if the judge is an official judge.
  - **Condition:** `X['Official'] == 1`
  - **Meaning:** If the judge is one of the three official judges.

- **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Evaluates if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
  - **Condition:** `X['Round'] <= 6`
  - **Meaning:** Early rounds of the match.

- **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):** Determines if the judge is G. Hamada (0), B. Logist (1), or J. Roth (2).
  - **Condition:** `X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2]`
  - **Meaning:** Specific official judges who may have scoring tendencies.

- **Node 3 (`nodes[3]`):** Checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (3).
  - **Condition:** `X['Judge'] == 3`
  - **Meaning:** A well-known unofficial judge who may favor De La Hoya.

- **Node 4 (`nodes[4]`):** Evaluates if the round number is greater than 9.
  - **Condition:** `X['Round'] > 9`
  - **Meaning:** Late rounds of the match.

**Decision Path:**

1. **If the judge is an official judge (`nodes[0]`):**
   - **And** the round is 1-6 (`nodes[1]`):
     - **And** the judge is G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth (`nodes[2]`):
       - **Prediction:** Trinidad wins the round (`prediction = 0`).
     - **Else:**
       - **Prediction:** De La Hoya wins the round (`prediction = 1`).
   - **Else** (Round 7-12):
     - **And** the judge is HBO-Lederman (`nodes[3]`):
       - **Prediction:** De La Hoya wins the round (`prediction = 1`).
     - **Else:**
       - **Prediction:** Trinidad wins the round (`prediction = 0`).
2. **Else** (Non-official judge):
   - **If** the round is 10-12 (`nodes[4]`):
     - **Prediction:** Trinidad wins the round (`prediction = 0`).
   - **Else:**
     - **Prediction:** De La Hoya wins the round (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input features:

```python
X = {
    'Judge': 3,        # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,     # Not an official judge
    'Round': 5         # Round 5
}
```

Predicting the winner:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Predicted Winner: {'Trinidad' if prediction == 0 else 'De La Hoya'}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Winner: De La Hoya
Node Truth Values: [False, True, False, True, False]
```

**Interpreting the Output:**

- **`nodes[0]`:** `False` (Judge is not an official judge)
- **`nodes[1]`:** `True` (Round â‰¤ 6)
- **`nodes[2]`:** `False` (Judge is not G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth)
- **`nodes[3]`:** `True` (Judge is HBO-Lederman)
- **`nodes[4]`:** `False` (Round is not > 9)

**Note on Thresholds and Conditions:**

- The thresholds and conditions in the decision tree are filled with meaningful values based on plausible scenarios in boxing judging.
- Official judges might score differently compared to non-official judges.
- Certain judges might have biases towards a fighter.
- Early rounds might favor one fighter over the other due to fighting styles or strategies.

**Please ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys as specified and the feature values are properly encoded based on the descriptions provided.**
