Certainly! Based on the decision tree we've constructed earlier, here's the Python function that represents the tree. This function takes a dictionary `X` with the specified features and returns the prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Round"] <= 8)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Feature Keys**: We are using the exact keys as specified:
  - `"Judge"`
  - `"Official"`
  - `"Round"`

- **Feature Encodings**:
  - `"Judge"`: Encoded as integers from 0 to 10.
  - `"Official"`: 1 for Yes, 0 for No.
  - `"Round"`: Integer from 1 to 12.

- **Target Variable**:
  - `0`: Trinidad
  - `1`: De La Hoya

### Function Details:

- **Nodes List**:
  - `nodes = [None]`: Initializes a list to hold the truth value of the inner node.
  - `nodes[0] = int(X["Round"] <= 8)`: Evaluates the condition of the decision tree. It will be `1` if the condition is `True` (i.e., `Round` ≤ 8) and `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction**:
  - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (i.e., `Round` ≤ 8), we predict `1`, representing **De La Hoya**.
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., `Round` > 8), we predict `0`, representing **Trinidad**.

- **Return Value**:
  - The function returns a tuple containing:
    - `prediction`: The predicted class label (`0` or `1`).
    - `nodes`: A list with the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

Here's how you can use this function:

```python
# Example input where Round is 5
X_example = {
    "Judge": 2,       # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = De La Hoya, 0 = Trinidad)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output**:

```
Prediction: 1 (1 = De La Hoya, 0 = Trinidad)
Nodes: [1]
```

### Notes:

- **Assumptions**:
  - We are assuming that the primary factor in determining the winner of a round is the round number, based on the general trend of the fight.
  - This is a simplified model for demonstration purposes.

- **Placeholders and Thresholds**:
  - Since we have only one decision node, the threshold we've filled in is `Round <= 8`, which we determined to be a meaningful split based on the fight's progression.

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Although we have other features (`Judge` and `Official`), for a depth-1 tree, we have selected `Round` as the most informative feature to split on.

### Reminder:

- Ensure that when you use this function, the input dictionary `X` contains all the required keys with correctly encoded values as specified.
