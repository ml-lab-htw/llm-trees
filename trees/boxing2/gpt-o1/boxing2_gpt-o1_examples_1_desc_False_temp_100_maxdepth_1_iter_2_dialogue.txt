Certainly! Based on the features and the target variable encoding you've provided, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # List to hold the truth value of each inner node
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is an official judge

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - **Official:** Indicates whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - We use the `Official` feature to split the data:
    - If `Official` is **1** (Yes), we predict **Trinidad** (encoded as `0`).
    - If `Official` is **0** (No), we predict **de la Hoya** (encoded as `1`).

- **Function Details:**
  - The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features.
  - `nodes` is a list that stores the truth value (`True` or `False`) of each inner node in the tree.
    - Since the tree has a maximum depth of 1, there is only one inner node (`nodes[0]`).
  - `nodes[0]` holds the result of the condition `X["Official"] == 1`.
    - It will be `True` if `Official` is `1` (Yes).
    - It will be `False` if `Official` is `0` (No).
  - Based on the value of `nodes[0]`, we assign the prediction:
    - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, `prediction` is `0` (Trinidad).
    - If `nodes[0]` is `False`, `prediction` is `1` (de la Hoya).
  - The function returns the `prediction` and the list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the function:

```python
# Example input where the judge is an official judge
X_example_1 = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction_1, nodes_1 = predict(X_example_1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction_1}, Nodes: {nodes_1}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [True]

# Example input where the judge is not an official judge
X_example_2 = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction_2, nodes_2 = predict(X_example_2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction_2}, Nodes: {nodes_2}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [False]
```

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` has the correct keys with exact spelling:
  - `"Judge"`
  - `"Official"`
  - `"Round"`
- The values for `"Official"` should be encoded as specified:
  - `1` for **Yes**
  - `0` for **No**
- The target variable is encoded as:
  - `0` for **Trinidad**
  - `1` for **de la Hoya**

**Summary:**

The decision tree uses the most significant feature, `Official`, to predict the winner of each round with a maximum depth of 1. The function `predict` encapsulates this logic and follows the required format, returning both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
