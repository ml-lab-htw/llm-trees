    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `'Judge'`: Encoded as integers 0 to 10.
  - `'Official'`: 1 for Yes, 0 for No.
  - `'Round'`: Integer from 1 to 12.

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge.
    - `nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1`
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the round is less than or equal to 6.
    - `nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6`
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the judge is among those who favored De La Hoya.
    - Judges favoring De La Hoya: `[3, 5, 6, 7]` (HBO-Lederman, Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, USA Today, Associated Press).
    - `nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [3, 5, 6, 7]`

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` (Official judge):
    - **If** `nodes[1]` (Round ≤ 6):
      - Predict **De La Hoya** (`prediction = 1`)
    - **Else** (Round > 6):
      - Predict **Trinidad** (`prediction = 0`)
  - **Else** (Not an Official judge):
    - **If** `nodes[2]` (Judge favors De La Hoya):
      - Predict **De La Hoya** (`prediction = 1`)
    - **Else** (Judge favors Trinidad):
      - Predict **Trinidad** (`prediction = 0`)

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X_sample = {
    'Judge': 3,      # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,   # Not an Official judge
    'Round': 5       # Round 5
}
```

Predicting:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Expected output: 1 (De La Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Nodes truth values
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [False, True, True]
```

- `nodes[0] = False` (Not an Official judge)
- `nodes[1] = True` (Round ≤ 6)
- `nodes[2] = True` (Judge favors De La Hoya)

**Notes:**

- The function evaluates all nodes regardless of the decision path, storing the truth values in the `nodes` list.
- The `nodes` list contains boolean values (`True` or `False`) corresponding to whether each condition is satisfied.
- The `prediction` variable holds the final class prediction:
  - `0` for **Trinidad**
  - `1` for **De La Hoya**

- **Thresholds and Conditions:**
  - The threshold for the round is `6`, dividing the early and late rounds.
  - The list of judges is defined based on their scoring tendencies in the match.

- **Feature Encoding Reminder:**
  - **Judge IDs:**
    - `0`: G. Hamada
    - `1`: B. Logist
    - `2`: J. Roth
    - `3`: HBO-Lederman
    - `4`: Sportsticker
    - `5`: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - `6`: USA Today
    - `7`: Associated Press
    - `8`: Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - `9`: Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - `10`: van de Wiele
  - **Official Judges (IDs 0 to 2):** G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth (when `'Official'` is `1`)
  - **Non-Official Judges (IDs 3 to 10):** Various media outlets and unofficial scorers (when `'Official'` is `0`)

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: **Trinidad**
  - `1`: **De La Hoya**

**Assumptions:**

- The input `X` is a dictionary containing the keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'` with correctly encoded values.
- The `'Judge'` value is an integer between `0` and `10`, corresponding to the judge encoding.
- The `'Official'` value is either `0` or `1`.
- The `'Round'` value is an integer between `1` and `12`.

**Function Behavior:**

- The function first evaluates all conditions and stores their truth values.
- It then uses the decision tree logic to arrive at a prediction based on these values.
- Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the nodes.

**Testing the Function:**

You can test the function with different inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

```python
# Example input where an Official judge scores Round 8
X_test = {
    'Judge': 1,      # B. Logist (Official judge)
    'Official': 1,   # Yes
    'Round': 8       # Round 8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_test)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Expected output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0
Nodes: [True, False, False]
```

- `nodes[0] = True` (Official judge)
- `nodes[1] = False` (Round > 6)
- `nodes[2] = False` (Not used in this path)

**Conclusion:**

This function provides a clear and concise implementation of the decision tree classifier based on the specified features and conditions. It follows the structure of the tree and adheres to the requirements of returning both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
