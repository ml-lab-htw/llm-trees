Certainly! Based on your request, here is the Python function that represents the decision tree we constructed earlier. The function returns the prediction (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and a list representing the truth values (1 for True, 0 for False) of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # Node 1: For official judges, check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # For non-official judges, default prediction is de la Hoya
        nodes[1] = None  # No further condition checked
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the judge is an **Official judge** (`Official` feature where 1 = Yes, 0 = No).
  - `nodes[0]` is set to **1** if the condition is **True** (`Official == 1`), else **0**.
- **Node 1:** If the judge is official (`nodes[0] == 1`), checks if the **Round** number is less than or equal to 6.
  - `nodes[1]` is set to **1** if the condition is **True** (`Round <= 6`), else **0**.
- **Prediction:** Based on the truth values of the nodes:
  - If `nodes[0] == 1` and `nodes[1] == 1`, predict **1** (de la Hoya).
  - If `nodes[0] == 1` and `nodes[1] == 0`, predict **0** (Trinidad).
  - If `nodes[0] == 0`, predict **1** (de la Hoya).
- **Nodes List:** Represents the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes = [Node 0 truth value, Node 1 truth value or None]`
    - **1** means the condition at that node is satisfied.
    - **0** means the condition is not satisfied.
    - **None** means the node was not evaluated (e.g., `Node 1` when `nodes[0] == 0`).

**Feature Keys (with exact spelling):**

- **"Judge"**
- **"Official"**
- **"Round"**

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **0**: Trinidad
- **1**: de la Hoya

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is an official judge and it's Round 5
X = {
    "Judge": 0,      # G. Hamada (official judge)
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Note:** Ensure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact feature keys as specified and that the feature values follow the encoding provided.
