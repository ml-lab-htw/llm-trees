Here is the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)  # 1 if Official == 1 (Yes), else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- We initialize a list `nodes` with one element to store the truth value of the inner node.
  
- **Node 0 Condition:**

  ```python
  nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
  ```
  
  - This condition checks if the **"Official"** feature equals **1** (which represents **"Yes"**).
  - `X["Official"]` accesses the value of the "Official" feature from the input dictionary `X`.
  - `X["Official"] == 1` evaluates to `True` if the judge is official, otherwise `False`.
  - We convert the Boolean result to an integer (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`) for consistency in the `nodes` list.

- **Prediction Logic:**

  ```python
  if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 0  # Trinidad
  else:
      prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
  ```
  
  - If the condition at Node 0 is satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `1`), the prediction is `0`, indicating **Trinidad** won the round.
  - If the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `0`), the prediction is `1`, indicating **de la Hoya** won the round.

- **Return Statement:**

  ```python
  return prediction, nodes
  ```
  
  - The function returns the `prediction` and the list of node truth values `nodes`.

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you might use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input where the judge is official
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,       # G. Hamada (but not used in decision)
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round number (but not used in decision)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1]
```

**Note on Feature Spelling and Encoding:**

- **Feature Keys:**

  - **"Judge"**: Exactly as spelled, representing the judge's identifier.
  - **"Official"**: Exactly as spelled, indicating if the judge is official (`1` for Yes, `0` for No).
  - **"Round"**: Exactly as spelled, the round number (from 1 to 12).

- **Target Variable:**

  - **Prediction Output**:
    - `0`: Trinidad
    - `1`: de la Hoya

**Thresholds and Placeholders:**

- In this decision tree, the decision is based on equality (`==`) rather than inequality thresholds.
- The condition uses the most meaningful value available (`Official == 1`) to split the data based on whether the judge is official.

**Summary:**

The function `predict` implements a decision tree of maximum depth 1 using the most important feature, **"Official"**, to classify which fighter won each round. It closely follows the specified format, using exact feature names and providing the internal node truth values as requested.
