Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier, returning a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    # Node 0: Is Official == 0 (No)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 0)
    if nodes[0]:
        # Official == No
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        # Official == Yes
        # Node 1: Is Round <= 6
        nodes[1] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)
        if nodes[1]:
            # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys Used:**
  - `'Judge'`
  - `'Official'`
  - `'Round'`

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: Trinidad
  - `1`: de la Hoya

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the condition `Official == 0` (Official Judge == No). It is `1` if the condition is true, `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the condition `Round <= 6`. It is evaluated only if `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., `Official == 1`).

- **Decision Tree Logic:**

  1. **First Node:** Check if the judge is an official judge.
     - If `Official == 0` (No), then:
       - Predict **de la Hoya** (`prediction = 1`).
       - Set `nodes[0] = 1`.
     - Else (`Official == 1`), proceed to the next condition.
       - Set `nodes[0] = 0`.

  2. **Second Node:** Since the judge is official, check the round number.
     - If `Round <= 6`:
       - Predict **de la Hoya** (`prediction = 1`).
       - Set `nodes[1] = 1`.
     - Else (`Round > 6`):
       - Predict **Trinidad** (`prediction = 0`).
       - Set `nodes[1] = 0`.

- **Return Values:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted class label (`0` for Trinidad, `1` for de la Hoya).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (`1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise) for the inner nodes.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where Official == No
X_example1 = {
    'Judge': 3,      # HBO-Lederman (unused in this tree)
    'Official': 0,   # No
    'Round': 5       # Round 5
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [1, None]

# Example input where Official == Yes and Round <= 6
X_example2 = {
    'Judge': 2,     # J. Roth (unused in this tree)
    'Official': 1,  # Yes
    'Round': 4      # Round 4
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: [0, 1]")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0, 1]

# Example input where Official == Yes and Round > 6
X_example3 = {
    'Judge': 0,     # G. Hamada (unused in this tree)
    'Official': 1,  # Yes
    'Round': 10     # Round 10
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: [0, 0]")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- The `'Judge'` feature is not used in this decision tree because the most significant features were `'Official'` and `'Round'`.
- All thresholds and conditions are set to meaningful values based on the given data.
- The function adheres to the specified maximum depth of 5, with only 2 inner nodes used in this case.
- The entries in the `nodes` list correspond to each condition check in the decision tree, making it easy to trace the path taken for the prediction.

**Understanding the Decision Path:**

- **If `nodes[0] == 1`** (Condition `Official == 0` is true):
  - The judge is not an official judge.
  - Prediction is **de la Hoya**.

- **Else (`nodes[0] == 0`)**, the judge is an official judge:
  - **If `nodes[1] == 1`** (Condition `Round <= 6` is true):
    - It's an early round (1-6).
    - Prediction is **de la Hoya**.
  - **Else (`nodes[1] == 0`)**:
    - It's a late round (7-12).
    - Prediction is **Trinidad**.

**Conclusion:**

This function effectively models the decision tree classifier for predicting which fighter won each round based on the provided features. It aligns with the specified requirements, including exact feature keys, target variable encoding, and formatting.
