**Key improvements in this version:**

* **Clearer Feature Usage:**  The code uses the exact feature names provided ('Judge', 'Official', 'Round').
* **Correct Target Encoding:**  The predictions are 0 for Trinidad and 1 for De La Hoya.
* **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates how to use the function and interpret the results.
* **Comments:** The code is well-commented to explain the logic.

**Important Note:**  This decision tree is still *hypothetical* because it's built on assumptions, not data.  To build a truly accurate model, you must provide a dataset, and the tree should be trained using a machine learning algorithm.  The thresholds and even the chosen features might be different after training on real data.
