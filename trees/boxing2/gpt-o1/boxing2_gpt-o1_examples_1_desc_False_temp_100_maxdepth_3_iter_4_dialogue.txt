Sure! Here is the Python function representing the decision tree, using the specified features and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Official == 1 (Yes)
        # Node 1: Check if the Judge is either G. Hamada (0) or J. Roth (2)
        nodes[1] = int(X['Judge'] in [0, 2])
        nodes[2] = 0  # Node 2 is not used in this branch
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If Official == 0 (No)
        nodes[1] = 0  # Node 1 is not used in this branch
        # Node 2: Check if the Round is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[2] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the condition `Official == 1` (Yes).
  - **nodes[0] = 1** if the judge is an official judge.
  - **nodes[0] = 0** if the judge is not an official judge.
  
- **nodes[1]** is used only when `Official == 1` and checks if the **Judge** is either **G. Hamada (0)** or **J. Roth (2)**.
  - **nodes[1] = 1** if the judge is G. Hamada or J. Roth.
  - **nodes[1] = 0** otherwise.
  
- **nodes[2]** is used only when `Official == 0` and checks if the **Round** is less than or equal to 6.
  - **nodes[2] = 1** if the round is 6 or earlier.
  - **nodes[2] = 0** if the round is after 6.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
sample_input = {
    'Judge': 0,       # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,    # Yes
    'Round': 5        # Round 5
}
```

Calling the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "de la Hoya")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Trinidad
Nodes: [1, 1, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0] = 1**: The judge is an official judge.
- **nodes[1] = 1**: The judge is either G. Hamada or J. Roth.
- **nodes[2] = 0**: Not evaluated in this branch.

Since both **nodes[0]** and **nodes[1]** conditions are satisfied, the prediction is **Trinidad**.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'` with the correct encodings as specified.
- The function returns:
  - **prediction**: `0` for **Trinidad**, `1` for **de la Hoya**.
  - **nodes**: A list of integers `[nodes[0], nodes[1], nodes[2]]`, where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs to see how the decision tree makes classifications based on the features provided.
