Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict` implementing the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer (Trinidad or De La Hoya) won each round, based on the features provided. The function returns the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Round is 6 or less
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys (Exact Spelling):**
  - `'Judge'`
  - `'Official'`
  - `'Round'`

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0` = Trinidad
  - `1` = De La Hoya

- **Decision Tree Logic:**

  1. **First Node (`nodes[0]`):**
     - **Condition:** `Round <= 6`
     - **Meaning:** Checks if the round number is 6 or less.
     - **Truth Value:** `1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

  2. **Second Node (`nodes[1]`):**
     - **Condition:** `Official == 1`
     - **Meaning:** Checks if the judge is an official judge.
     - **Truth Value:** `1` if condition is satisfied, `0` otherwise.

- **Prediction Logic:**

  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (Round â‰¤ 6):
    - **Prediction:** `1` (De La Hoya)
  - **Else** (Round > 6):
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is `1` (Official judge):
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad)
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** `1` (De La Hoya)

- **Conversion of Truth Values:**
  - The boolean values in `nodes` are converted to integers (`1` for `True`, `0` for `False`).

### **Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X = {
    'Judge': 2,       # J. Roth
    'Official': 1,    # Yes (Official judge)
    'Round': 8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "De La Hoya" if prediction == 1 else "Trinidad")
print("Inner Nodes Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Trinidad
Inner Nodes Truth Values: [0, 1]
```

### **Feature and Target Descriptions:**

- **Features:**
  - **Judge:** Judge (Encoded as integers)
    - `0` = G. Hamada
    - `1` = B. Logist
    - `2` = J. Roth
    - `3` = HBO-Lederman
    - `4` = Sportsticker
    - `5` = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - `6` = USA Today
    - `7` = Associated Press
    - `8` = Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - `9` = Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - `10` = van de Wiele
  - **Official:** Official judge
    - `1` = Yes
    - `0` = No
  - **Round:** Round number (Integer from 1 to 12)

- **Target Variable:**
  - `0` = Trinidad wins the round
  - `1` = De La Hoya wins the round

### **Notes:**

- **Thresholds and Conditions:**
  - The threshold for **Round** is `6`, meaning the first half of the match.
  - The condition for **Official** checks if the judge is an official one.

- **Interpretation:**
  - **Rounds 1-6:**
    - De La Hoya is predicted to win, as he was known for strong performance in early rounds.
  - **Rounds 7-12:**
    - If the judge is official (`Official == 1`), Trinidad is predicted to win, reflecting possible scoring tendencies.
    - If the judge is not official (`Official == 0`), De La Hoya is still predicted to win, assuming unofficial judges might lean towards him.

- **Adjustments:**
  - The decision tree uses meaningful thresholds based on boxing match dynamics and judging.

- **Function Signature:**
  - The function accepts a dictionary `X` with keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.
  - Returns:
    - `prediction`: `0` or `1` representing Trinidad or De La Hoya respectively.
    - `nodes`: List of integers (`1` or `0`) indicating whether each condition in the inner nodes is satisfied.

### **Complete Function Ready for Use:**

Copy and paste the function into your Python script to use it for predictions based on the provided features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Inner Node Conditions
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6  # Condition for Node 0
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1  # Condition for Node 1

    # Decision Logic
    if nodes[0]:
        # Round <= 6
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:
        # Round > 6
        if nodes[1]:
            # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            # Non-official judge
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya

    # Convert boolean values to integers
    nodes = [int(node) for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

Feel free to test the function with different inputs to see how the predictions and inner node truth values change.
