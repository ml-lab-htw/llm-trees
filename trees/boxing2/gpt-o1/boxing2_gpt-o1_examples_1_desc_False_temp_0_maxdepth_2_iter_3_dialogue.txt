**Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Tree:** The logic in this function is entirely hypothetical.  The thresholds (Round <= 6) and the resulting predictions are placeholders.  You *must* replace these with values derived from actual data.
* **Data Required:** To create a meaningful decision tree, you need a dataset that shows who won each round (Trinidad or De La Hoya) along with the corresponding values for `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
* **Scikit-learn:** For real-world decision tree creation, use the `DecisionTreeClassifier` class from the scikit-learn library in Python. It handles the tree building, threshold selection, and evaluation automatically based on the data you provide.  The code above only demonstrates the *structure* of a simple decision tree function, not how to train one from data.


Once you have the data, I can show you how to build and train a decision tree using scikit-learn.  Just provide the data in a format like a CSV file or a Pandas DataFrame.
