```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0
    # Node 1: Is the round number less than or equal to 6?
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0
    # Node 2: Is the judge HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["Judge"] == 3 else 0  # 3 corresponds to HBO-Lederman

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge == Yes
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge == HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a list `nodes` with three `None` elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` == 1). Records `1` if true, else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the `Round` number is less than or equal to `6`. Records `1` if true, else `0`.
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the `Judge` is `HBO-Lederman` (encoded as `3`). Records `1` if true, else `0`.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `nodes[0]` is `1` (Official judge is `Yes`):
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad)
  - **Else** (Official judge is `No`):
    - **If** `nodes[1]` is `1` (Round <= 6):
      - **Prediction:** `1` (de la Hoya)
    - **Else** (Round > 6):
      - **If** `nodes[2]` is `1` (Judge == HBO-Lederman):
        - **Prediction:** `1` (de la Hoya)
      - **Else**:
        - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad)

**Feature Encodings and Target Variable:**

- **Features:**
  - `Judge`: Encoded as per the provided mapping:
    - `0`: G. Hamada
    - `1`: B. Logist
    - `2`: J. Roth
    - `3`: **HBO-Lederman**
    - `4`: Sportsticker
    - `5`: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
    - `6`: USA Today
    - `7`: Associated Press
    - `8`: Las Vegas Review-Journal
    - `9`: Los Angeles Times-Springer
    - `10`: van de Wiele
  - `Official`: Official judge (`1` = Yes, `0` = No)
  - `Round`: Round number (`1` to `12`)

- **Target Variable:**
  - `0`: Trinidad
  - `1`: de la Hoya

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 3,      # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,   # Not an official judge
    "Round": 9       # Round 9
}
```

Using the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "de la Hoya")
print("Node Truth Values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: de la Hoya
Node Truth Values: [0, 0, 1]
```

**Explanation of Output:**

- `nodes[0] = 0`: Judge is not an official judge.
- `nodes[1] = 0`: Round 9 > 6.
- `nodes[2] = 1`: Judge is HBO-Lederman.
- Based on the decision logic, the prediction is `1` (de la Hoya).

**Function Definition Breakdown:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes = [None] * 3

    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    # Official: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0

    # Node 1: Is the round number less than or equal to 6?
    # Round: 1 to 12
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0

    # Node 2: Is the judge HBO-Lederman?
    # Judge: 3 corresponds to HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["Judge"] == 3 else 0

    # Apply decision rules based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge == Yes
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge == HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    # Return the prediction and the list of node truth values
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Note:**

- This decision tree adheres to a maximum depth of 3.
- All feature names and target values are used exactly as specified.
- The function can be used to make predictions on new data by passing a dictionary `X` with keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`, and values according to the provided encodings.

**Assumptions:**

- The thresholds and conditions are derived to reflect meaningful splits based on the features provided.
- Judge ID `3` corresponds to HBO-Lederman, included to add depth and utilize the `'Judge'` feature.
- This model is a simplistic representation and assumes patterns based on the given context.
