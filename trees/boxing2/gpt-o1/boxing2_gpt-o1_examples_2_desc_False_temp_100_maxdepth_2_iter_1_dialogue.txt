Certainly! Based on the features you've provided (`'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`) and the target variable (which boxer won each round: `0 = Trinidad`, `1 = de la Hoya`), I'll create a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. The decision tree will be represented as a Python function that returns a prediction and a list indicating the truth values of the inner nodes.

Since we don't have actual data to determine the most important features and thresholds statistically, I'll make reasonable assumptions based on the context to fill in meaningful values.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Node 0: Check if the round is in the first half (Rounds 1-6)
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** 
  - **Condition:** `X["Round"] <= 6`
  - **Meaning:** Checks if the round number is 6 or less, implying it's in the first half of the fight.
  - **Assumption:** de la Hoya tends to perform better in the earlier rounds.
- **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** 
  - **Condition:** `X["Official"] == 1`
  - **Meaning:** Checks if the judge is an official judge.
  - **Assumption:** Official judges may have scoring patterns that favor certain boxers.

### Decision Logic:

- **First Level (Depth 1):** 
  - If the round is **6 or earlier** (`nodes[0]` is `True`), proceed to Node 1.
  - If the round is **after 6** (`nodes[0]` is `False`), predict **Trinidad** (`prediction = 0`).
- **Second Level (Depth 2):**
  - Since `nodes[0]` is `True`, check if the judge is an **official judge** (`nodes[1]`).
    - Regardless of the outcome of `nodes[1]` in this simplified model, predict **de la Hoya** (`prediction = 1`).

### Thresholds:

- **`Round <= 6`**:
  - **Threshold Value:** `6`
  - **Justification:** Splits the fight into early and late rounds.
- **`Official == 1`**:
  - **Threshold Value:** `1` (Yes)
  - **Justification:** Differentiates between official and unofficial judges.

### Usage Example:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 2,       # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [1, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Nodes List:** `[1, 1]`
  - `nodes[0] = 1` because `Round` (5) is <= 6.
  - `nodes[1] = 1` because `Official` is `1` (Yes).
- **Prediction:** `1` (de la Hoya)

### Notes:

- The entries in the `nodes` list are `1` if the condition of the corresponding node is satisfied and `0` otherwise.
- This function is a simplified model for illustrative purposes. In a real-world scenario, the decision tree would be derived from data analysis to determine the most significant features and optimal thresholds.

### Function Summary:

- **Input:** A dictionary `X` with keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.
- **Output:** A tuple containing:
  - `prediction`: An integer (`0` or `1`) representing the predicted winner.
    - `0` for **Trinidad**
    - `1` for **de la Hoya**
  - `nodes`: A list of integers (`1` or `0`) representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Feel free to use this function and adjust the thresholds if you have specific data that suggests different values.
