Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes (1 if the condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise).

Based on the features provided—**'Judge'**, **'Official'**, and **'Round'**—we can build a decision tree using meaningful thresholds:

- **Node 0**: Is the judge an official judge? (`X['Official'] == 1`)
  - **Yes**:
    - **Node 1**: Is the round number less than or equal to **6**? (`X['Round'] <= 6`)
      - **Yes**: Predict **0** (Trinidad)
      - **No**: Predict **1** (de la Hoya)
  - **No**:
    - **Node 2**: Is the judge among those who favored de la Hoya? (`X['Judge']` in `[3, 4, 6, 7]`)
      - **Yes**: Predict **1** (de la Hoya)
      - **No**: Predict **0** (Trinidad)

Here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if the round is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 is not evaluated in this path
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated in this path
        # Node 2: Check if the judge favored de la Hoya
        # Judges who favored de la Hoya: 3 (HBO-Lederman), 4 (Sportsticker), 6 (USA Today), 7 (Associated Press)
        nodes[2] = int(X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 6, 7])
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **`nodes[0]`** checks whether the judge is an official judge:
  - `nodes[0] = 1` if `X['Official'] == 1` (Yes)
  - `nodes[0] = 0` if `X['Official'] == 0` (No)
  
- **If `nodes[0]` is 1** (Official judge):
  - **`nodes[1]`** checks if the round number is less than or equal to **6**:
    - Early rounds may have been scored differently.
    - `nodes[1] = 1` if `X['Round'] <= 6`
    - `nodes[1] = 0` if `X['Round'] > 6`
  - **Predictions**:
    - If `nodes[1] = 1`: Predict **0** (Trinidad)
    - If `nodes[1] = 0`: Predict **1** (de la Hoya)
  - **`nodes[2]`** is set to `None` because it is not evaluated in this branch.
  
- **If `nodes[0]` is 0** (Not an official judge):
  - **`nodes[2]`** checks if the judge is among those who favored de la Hoya:
    - Judges **3, 4, 6, 7** are selected as those who may have favored de la Hoya.
    - `nodes[2] = 1` if `X['Judge']` is in `[3, 4, 6, 7]`
    - `nodes[2] = 0` otherwise
  - **Predictions**:
    - If `nodes[2] = 1`: Predict **1** (de la Hoya)
    - If `nodes[2] = 0`: Predict **0** (Trinidad)
  - **`nodes[1]`** is set to `None` because it is not evaluated in this branch.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Features:**
  - `'Judge'`: Encoded as integers from **0** to **10** representing different judges.
  - `'Official'`: Official judge status (**1** = Yes, **0** = No).
  - `'Round'`: Round number ranging from **1** to **12**.

- **Target Variable:**
  - **0**: Trinidad
  - **1**: de la Hoya

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is official, round 5
X_example1 = {
    'Judge': 1,     # B. Logist (official judge)
    'Official': 1,  # Yes
    'Round': 5
}

prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X_example1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes1}")

# Example input where the judge is not official and favored de la Hoya
X_example2 = {
    'Judge': 3,     # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,  # No
    'Round': 8
}

prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X_example2)
print(f"\nPrediction: {prediction2} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")

# Example input where the judge is not official and did not favor de la Hoya
X_example3 = {
    'Judge': 9,     # Los Angeles Times-Springer
    'Official': 0,  # No
    'Round': 10
}

prediction3, nodes3 = predict(X_example3)
print(f"\nPrediction: {prediction3} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes3}")
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: 0 (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
Nodes: [1, 1, None]

Prediction: 1 (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
Nodes: [0, None, 1]

Prediction: 0 (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
Nodes: [0, None, 0]
```

**Explanation of Examples:**

1. **First Example (`X_example1`):**
   - Official judge (`nodes[0] = 1`)
   - Round 5 (`nodes[1] = 1` since `5 <= 6`)
   - Prediction: **0** (Trinidad)

2. **Second Example (`X_example2`):**
   - Not an official judge (`nodes[0] = 0`)
   - Judge is HBO-Lederman (`nodes[2] = 1` since `Judge = 3`)
   - Prediction: **1** (de la Hoya)

3. **Third Example (`X_example3`):**
   - Not an official judge (`nodes[0] = 0`)
   - Judge is Los Angeles Times-Springer (`Judge = 9`), not in the list favoring de la Hoya
   - `nodes[2] = 0`
   - Prediction: **0** (Trinidad)

**Notes:**

- The thresholds and conditions are filled with meaningful values based on assumptions about how different judges and rounds might affect the outcome.
- The nodes list provides insight into which conditions were evaluated and their truth values.
- If a node is not evaluated due to the tree's structure, it is set to **`None`**.

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- **Judges (encoded 0 - 10):**
  - 0: G. Hamada
  - 1: B. Logist
  - 2: J. Roth
  - 3: HBO-Lederman
  - 4: Sportsticker
  - 5: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - 6: USA Today
  - 7: Associated Press
  - 8: Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - 9: Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - 10: van de Wiele

By structuring the decision tree in this way, we've incorporated all the features provided and ensured that all placeholders for thresholds are filled with meaningful values.
