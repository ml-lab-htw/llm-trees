Based on the decision tree we previously constructed and the provided feature encodings, here is the Python function `predict` that takes a dictionary `X` with keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`, and returns a single prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 4  # Initialize a list to hold the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Official'] == 1 else 0

    # Node 1: For official judges, check if the round is less than or equal to 6
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = 1 if X['Round'] <= 6 else 0
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Not applicable in this branch

    # Node 2: For unofficial judges, check if the judge is HBO-Lederman (encoded as 3)
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[2] = 1 if X['Judge'] == 3 else 0
    else:
        nodes[2] = None  # Not applicable in this branch

    # Node 3: For other unofficial judges, check if the round is less than or equal to 9
    if nodes[2] == 0 and not nodes[0]:
        nodes[3] = 1 if X['Round'] <= 9 else 0
    else:
        nodes[3] = None  # Not applicable in this branch

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Unofficial judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Other unofficial judges
            if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 9
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 9
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`1` if yes, `0` if no).
  - `nodes[1]`: (Applicable only if `nodes[0] == 1`) Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
  - `nodes[2]`: (Applicable only if `nodes[0] == 0`) Checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (encoded as `3`).
  - `nodes[3]`: (Applicable only if `nodes[2] == 0` and `nodes[0] == 0`) Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 9.

- **Prediction:**
  - **Official Judge Branch (`nodes[0] == 1`):**
    - If the round is less than or equal to 6 (`nodes[1] == 1`), predict **de la Hoya** (`1`).
    - Else, predict **Trinidad** (`0`).
  - **Unofficial Judge Branch (`nodes[0] == 0`):**
    - If the judge is HBO-Lederman (`nodes[2] == 1`), predict **de la Hoya** (`1`).
    - Else, for other unofficial judges:
      - If the round is less than or equal to 9 (`nodes[3] == 1`), predict **de la Hoya** (`1`).
      - Else, predict **Trinidad** (`0`).

**Feature Encoding:**

- **'Judge':** Encoded as integers from `0` to `10`:
  - `0`: G. Hamada
  - `1`: B. Logist
  - `2`: J. Roth
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - `6`: USA Today
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - `9`: Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - `10`: van de Wiele

- **'Official':** `1` for Yes, `0` for No.

- **'Round':** Integer from `1` to `12`.

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: **Trinidad**
- `1`: **de la Hoya**

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input: Official judge (Yes), Round 5
X_example = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'de la Hoya' if prediction == 1 else 'Trinidad'}")
print(f"Nodes truth values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: de la Hoya
Nodes truth values: [1, 1, None, None]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0] == 1` (Official judge is Yes)
- `nodes[1] == 1` (Round 5 <= 6)
- Prediction is **de la Hoya** (`1`).

**Notes:**

- The function strictly adheres to the provided decision tree and encodings.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into the path taken in the decision tree:
  - `1` means the condition at that node is **satisfied**.
  - `0` means the condition at that node is **not satisfied**.
  - `None` means the node was **not evaluated** in that path.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs to see how it predicts the winner of each round based on the judge, whether they are an official judge, and the round number.
