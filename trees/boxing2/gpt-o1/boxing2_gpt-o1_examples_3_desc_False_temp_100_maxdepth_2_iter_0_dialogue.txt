Sure! Based on the features and the decision tree, here's a Python function that predicts which boxer won each round, along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize the list for inner node truth values

    # Node 0: Checks if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0

    # Node 1: Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Official judge == Yes
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # If Official judge == No
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            # If Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the condition `Official == 1` (1 if True, 0 if False).
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the condition `Round <= 6` (1 if True, 0 if False).

- **Decision Tree Logic:**

  - **Root Node (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if the judge is an official judge.
    - **If `Official == 1` (nodes[0] == 1):**
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad wins the round).
    - **Else (`Official == 0`, nodes[0] == 0):**
      - **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
        - **If `Round <= 6` (nodes[1] == 1):**
          - **Prediction:** `1` (de la Hoya wins the round).
        - **Else (`Round > 6`, nodes[1] == 0):**
          - **Prediction:** `0` (Trinidad wins the round).

**Thresholds Explanation:**

- **`Official` Feature:**
  - `Official == 1` implies an official judge (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth).
  - These judges officially scored the fight in favor of Trinidad.

- **`Round` Feature:**
  - Threshold of `Round <= 6` is used because many unofficial judges and media outlets scored the early rounds (1-6) in favor of de la Hoya due to his performance.
  - In later rounds (7-12), de la Hoya's performance declined, and Trinidad's performance was stronger, leading to rounds being scored in his favor.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
# Example input where the round is 4, judged by an unofficial judge
X_example = {
    "Judge": 3,      # HBO-Lederman (an unofficial judge)
    "Official": 0,   # Not an official judge
    "Round": 4       # Round 4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print("Prediction:", "Trinidad" if prediction == 0 else "de la Hoya")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: de la Hoya
Nodes: [0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = 0`: The judge is not an official judge.
- `nodes[1] = 1`: The round number is less than or equal to 6.
- Based on the decision tree, this results in a prediction of `1`, indicating that **de la Hoya** won the round according to this model.

**Notes:**

- The function follows the format specified in your examples.
- The `nodes` list contains binary values indicating whether each condition is satisfied.
- The decision tree uses the most important features (`Official` and `Round`) to make the prediction with a maximum depth of 2.
