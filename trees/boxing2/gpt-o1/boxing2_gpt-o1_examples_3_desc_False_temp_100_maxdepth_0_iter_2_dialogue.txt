Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the specified features and encodings, here is the Python function implementing the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize list to store node conditions

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1

    if nodes[0]:  # If Official == 1 (Yes)
        # Node 1: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 is not evaluated in this branch
    else:  # Official == 0 (No)
        # Node 1: Check if the judge favors de la Hoya
        nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 6, 7]  # Judges favoring de la Hoya
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya wins
            nodes[2] = None  # Node 2 is not evaluated in this path
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the judge favors Trinidad
            nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [5, 8, 9, 10]  # Judges favoring Trinidad
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                # Default case (should not occur with provided data)
                prediction = 1  # Default to de la Hoya
    # Convert boolean conditions to integers (1 if true, 0 if false)
    nodes = [int(n) if n is not None else None for n in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Feature Keys:**
- `'Judge'`: Encoded as integers:
  - `0`: G. Hamada
  - `1`: B. Logist
  - `2`: J. Roth
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Los Angeles Times-Kawakami
  - `6`: USA Today
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: Las Vegas Review-Journal
  - `9`: Los Angeles Times-Springer
  - `10`: van de Wiele
- `'Official'`: Official judge status (`1` = Yes, `0` = No)
- `'Round'`: Round number (from `1` to `12`)

**Target Variable Encoding:**
- `0`: Trinidad wins the round
- `1`: de la Hoya wins the round

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **Node 0** checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` feature).
  - If **Yes (`Official` == 1)**:
    - **Node 1** checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
      - If **Yes**, predict **de la Hoya** wins.
      - If **No**, predict **Trinidad** wins.
  - If **No (`Official` == 0)**:
    - **Node 1** checks if the judge is among those who favor **de la Hoya** (`Judge` in `[3, 4, 6, 7]`).
      - If **Yes**, predict **de la Hoya** wins.
      - If **No**, **Node 2** checks if the judge is among those who favor **Trinidad** (`Judge` in `[5, 8, 9, 10]`).
        - If **Yes**, predict **Trinidad** wins.
        - If **No**, default to predicting **de la Hoya** wins (this case should not occur with provided data).

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input data
X_example = {
    'Judge': 0,      # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,   # Yes
    'Round': 5       # Round 5
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} ({'de la Hoya' if prediction == 1 else 'Trinidad'})")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1 (de la Hoya)
Nodes: [1, 1, None]
```

**Interpreting the Nodes List:**

- `nodes[0]`: `1` if the judge is an official judge (`Official` == 1), else `0`.
- `nodes[1]`: `1` if the condition in this branch is satisfied, else `0`. In the official judge branch, it's based on `Round <= 6`.
- `nodes[2]`: Only evaluated in the non-official judge branch when the judge doesn't favor de la Hoya. It's `1` if the judge favors Trinidad, else `0`.
- `None` indicates that the node was not evaluated in that execution path.

**Notes:**

- This function strictly follows the provided decision tree and uses the most important features.
- The nodes list helps trace the path taken in the decision tree for the given input.
- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the correct keys with properly encoded values as specified.
