    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:

            'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            'Round': Round (1-12)

    Returns:

               and a list of boolean values representing the inner node conditions.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Encoding:** Uses the provided encoding for judges and official status.
* **Meaningful Thresholds:**  Uses round 6 as the split point for early/late rounds. (Still a placeholder, but more logical).
* **Python Function Format:** Follows the requested function structure, returning both the prediction and node truth values.
* **Docstrings:** Includes a docstring to explain the function's purpose and parameters.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to call the function and interpret the results.

Remember, the class assignments (Trinidad/De La Hoya) are *still placeholders*. You *must* train a decision tree on real data to get accurate predictions. This code provides the correct structure to make predictions based on your chosen features and the described logic, but the accuracy depends entirely on the training data used to determine the actual relationships in the fight.
