```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Official'] == 1 else 0
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['Round'] > 6 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:** We initialize a `nodes` list with two elements to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Each entry is set to `1` if the condition is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

- **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if the judge is an official judge.
  ```python
  nodes[0] = 1 if X['Official'] == 1 else 0
  ```
  
- **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if the round number is greater than 6.
  ```python
  nodes[1] = 1 if X['Round'] > 6 else 0
  ```
  
- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If Node 0 condition is satisfied (`Official` judge):**
    - **If Node 1 condition is satisfied (`Round` > 6):** Predict **Trinidad** (encoded as `0`).
    - **Else:** Predict **de la Hoya** (encoded as `1`).
  - **Else:** Predict **de la Hoya** (encoded as `1`).
  
- **Return Value:** The function returns a tuple containing the `prediction` and the `nodes` list.
  ```python
  return prediction, nodes
  ```

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is official and the round is 8
X_example = {
    'Judge': 0,        # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1,     # Yes
    'Round': 8
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0 (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Keys:** Pay close attention to the spelling and casing of the feature keys as specified:
  - `'Judge'`
  - `'Official'`
  - `'Round'`

- **Thresholds and Conditions:**
  - The threshold for `Round` is set at `6`, dividing early and late rounds.
  - The conditions are chosen to reflect the potential bias in official judging and how fight dynamics can change over rounds.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0` represents **Trinidad**
  - `1` represents **de la Hoya**

- **Assumptions:**
  - Official judges tend to favor **Trinidad** in later rounds.
  - Non-official judges (and official judges in early rounds) favor **de la Hoya**.

This function allows you to predict the winner of a boxing round based on the judge's status and the round number, using a simple decision tree of maximum depth 2.
