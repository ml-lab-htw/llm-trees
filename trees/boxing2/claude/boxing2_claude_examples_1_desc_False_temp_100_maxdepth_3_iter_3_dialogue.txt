Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the most relevant features and follows the structure I suggested earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Check if it's Judge Hamada (0)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0
    # Check if it's HBO-Lederman (3)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3
    # Check if it's in the first half of the fight
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # Not Hamada
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Hamada
        if nodes[2]:  # First half of fight
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary with the features as input
2. Creates three binary nodes representing the decision points
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node values
4. Uses the actual feature names and encodings provided
5. Makes logical splits based on judge identity and round number
6. Returns predictions matching the specified encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

The tree structure reflects the narrative that Hamada's scoring was particularly important, with round number being a key factor in his decisions, while HBO-Lederman's scoring provides another important perspective for other judges' rounds.
