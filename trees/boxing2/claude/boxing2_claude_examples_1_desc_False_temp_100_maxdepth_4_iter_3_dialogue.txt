Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and format requirements, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Not official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Other non-official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 6
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 3
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 3
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 boolean nodes representing the conditions
3. Uses the actual feature names and encodings provided
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions
5. Makes logical splits based on whether the judge is official, if it's HBO-Lederman, and the round number
6. Uses sensible thresholds for the round numbers (3 and 6) to capture early vs. late fight patterns

The conditions in the nodes array represent:
- nodes[0]: Is it not an official judge?
- nodes[1]: Is it HBO-Lederman?
- nodes[2]: Is it round 6 or earlier?
- nodes[3]: Is it round 3 or earlier?
