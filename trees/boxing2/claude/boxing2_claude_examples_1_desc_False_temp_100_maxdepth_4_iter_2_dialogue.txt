Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the boxing match decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for 4 inner nodes
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if it's an official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds threshold
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 3  # Very early rounds threshold
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # If not HBO-Lederman
        if not nodes[1]:  # If not official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # If official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[3]:  # If Round <= 3
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
- Uses the correct feature names and encodings as specified
- Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
- Uses reasonable thresholds based on boxing match structure (early rounds vs late rounds)
- Follows the decision tree structure I provided earlier, but adapted to the exact feature specifications
