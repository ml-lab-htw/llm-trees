Based on the provided information and examples, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # Official judges
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4]  # HBO-Lederman or Sportsticker
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 7  # Threshold for round

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth
            if X["Judge"] == 0:  # G. Hamada
                if X["Round"] <= 6:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:  # B. Logist or J. Roth
                if X["Round"] <= 9:
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Unlikely case, default to de la Hoya
    else:  # Unofficial judge
        if nodes[2]:  # HBO-Lederman or Sportsticker
            if X["Round"] <= 8:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Other unofficial judges
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes into account:

1. Whether the judge is official or not
2. The specific judge (for official judges)
3. The round number

The function returns a prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that this decision tree is a
