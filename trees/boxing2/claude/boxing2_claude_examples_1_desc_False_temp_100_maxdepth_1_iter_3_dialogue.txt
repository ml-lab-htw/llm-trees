Based on your specifications and the encoding details provided, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree that classifies rounds between Trinidad (0) and de la Hoya (1), using "Official" as the main splitting feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one decision node since max_depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If not an official judge (Official <= 0.5)
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If official judge (Official > 0.5)
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list for storing the node conditions (only one node since max_depth=1)
3. Checks if the judge is not official (Official <= 0.5)
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the actual encoding provided (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)

The decision boundary is set at 0.5 since "Official" is encoded as a binary variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
