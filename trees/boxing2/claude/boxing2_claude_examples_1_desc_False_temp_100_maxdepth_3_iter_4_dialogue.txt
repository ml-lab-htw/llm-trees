Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and requirements, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:  # Not official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses the exact feature names provided: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'
- Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
- Returns a list of boolean values for each decision node
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions
- Has a maximum depth of 3
- Makes logical splits based on whether the judge is official, if it's HBO-Lederman (Judge = 3), and the round number
- Is consistent with the narrative that de la Hoya was stronger in early rounds and Trinidad in later rounds
