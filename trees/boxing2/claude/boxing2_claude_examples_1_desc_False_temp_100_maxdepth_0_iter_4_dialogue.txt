Here's the Python function implementing the decision tree for the boxing match classification:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] > 0.5
    
    # Node 1: Check judge identity for unofficial scorers
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [3, 6, 7]  # HBO-Lederman, USA Today, Associated Press
    
    # Node 2: Check round number for official judges
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # Unofficial judges
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judges
        if X["Judge"] == 0:  # G. Hamada
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # B. Logist or J. Roth
            if not nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 6
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses exactly the provided feature names ('Judge', 'Official', 'Round')
2. Follows the correct encoding for the target variable (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
3. Uses the provided encoding for the features (e.g., Judge numbers 0-10, Official as 0/1)
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
5. Contains concrete threshold values that make sense in the context
6. Implements the same logic as the text-based decision tree from the previous response

The three nodes represent:
1. Whether it's an official judge (Official > 0.5)
2. Whether it's one of the media outlets that favored de la Hoya
3. Whether it's after round 6 (for official judges' decisions)
