Based on the provided information and examples, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2  # Official judges are 0, 1, 2
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the features for a single round.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first split (nodes[0]) checks if the judge is one of the official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth).

4. For official judges (nodes[0] is True):
   - We split based on the round number (nodes[1]). If it's round 6 or earlier, we predict de la Hoya (1), otherwise Trinidad (0).

5. For non-official judges (nodes[0] is False):
   - We split based on whether they are an official judge or not (nodes[2]). If they are not official (Official <= 0.5), we predict de la Hoya (1), otherwise Trinidad (0).

6. The function returns the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, with slight modifications to fit the exact feature names and encodings provided. The thresholds for the Judge and Round features have been set to meaningful values based on the given information.
