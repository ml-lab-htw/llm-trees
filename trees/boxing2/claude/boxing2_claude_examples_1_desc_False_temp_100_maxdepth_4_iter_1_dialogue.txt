Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the exact feature names and appropriate thresholds. The tree will focus on predicting whether de la Hoya (1) or Trinidad (0) won each round.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for storing node conditions
    
    # Decision nodes with realistic thresholds
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] >= 10
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[3]:  # Late rounds (>=10)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Early rounds (<=6)
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'
2. Returns predictions using the specified encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
3. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for each decision node
4. Uses realistic thresholds based on the feature descriptions
5. Has a maximum depth of 4
6. Focuses on the most important features that would likely influence the round scoring

The main decision points are:
- Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
- Whether it's an official judge (Official == 1)
- Whether it's an early round (Round <= 6)
- Whether it's a late round (Round >= 10)
