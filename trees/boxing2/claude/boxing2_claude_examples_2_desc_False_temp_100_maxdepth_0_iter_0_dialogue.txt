Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 8.5
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 1  # B. Logist
    nodes[6] = X["Judge"] == 2  # J. Roth

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 3 else 0  # HBO-Lederman's decision
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 0 else 1  # G. Hamada's decision or de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 1 else 0  # B. Logist's decision
            elif nodes[6]:
                prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 2 else 0  # J. Roth's decision
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree is based on the structure we discussed earlier, with some adjustments to fit the exact feature keys and target encoding provided. The function checks the conditions at each node and follows
