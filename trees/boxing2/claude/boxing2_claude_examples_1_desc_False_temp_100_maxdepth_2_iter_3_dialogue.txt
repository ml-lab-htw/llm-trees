Based on the provided feature names, encoding, and requirements, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Check if Judge is G. Hamada
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Check if it's in the first half of the fight
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is G. Hamada
        if nodes[1]:  # If Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If Judge is not G. Hamada
        if X["Official"]:  # If Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree with the following logic:
1. First node checks if the judge is G. Hamada (Judge == 0)
2. Second node checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6)
3. Returns predictions encoded as 0 for Trinidad and 1 for de la Hoya
4. Also returns the list of boolean values for the inner nodes

The function takes a dictionary X with the features and returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions.
