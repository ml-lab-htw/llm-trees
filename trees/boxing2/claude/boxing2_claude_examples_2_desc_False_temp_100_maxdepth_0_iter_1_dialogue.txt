Based on the provided information and requirements, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Associated Press
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            if X["Judge"] == 2:  # J. Roth
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree is based on the following logic:
1. First, it checks if the judge is official or not.
2. For unofficial judges, it considers HBO-Lederman's opinion and then the Associated Press.
3. For official judges, it considers the round number (early or late in the fight).
4. It then takes into account specific judges' opinions (J. Roth for early rounds, G. Hamada for later rounds).

This implementation uses the exact keys provided for the features and follows the specified encoding for the target variable and feature values. The thresholds and conditions are set based on the information given in the original decision tree description.
