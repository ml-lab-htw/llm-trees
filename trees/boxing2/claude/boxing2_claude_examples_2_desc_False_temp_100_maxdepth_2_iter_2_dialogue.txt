Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier and the information you've provided, here's the Python function that predicts the winner of each round and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the features for a single round.

2. We create a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the judge is official (Official <= 0.5).

4. The second node checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3).

5. The third node checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6.5).

6. The prediction is made based on these conditions:
   - If it's not an official judge (nodes[0] is True):
     - If it's HBO-Lederman, predict Trinidad (0)
     - Otherwise, predict de la Hoya (1)
   - If it's an official judge (nodes[0] is False):
     - If it's in the first half of the fight, predict de la Hoya (1)
     - Otherwise, predict Trinidad (0)

7. The function returns the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node truth values.

This function follows the structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact keys and encodings you provided for the features and target variable.
