Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6.5
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 0  # G. Hamada

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. It evaluates the conditions for each node:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is not an official judge (Official <= 0.5)
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6.5)
   - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the judge is G. Hamada (Judge == 0)

3. It then uses these conditions to navigate the decision tree and make a prediction:
   - If not an official judge:
     - If it's the first half of the fight, predict de la Hoya (1)
     - Otherwise, predict Trinidad (0)
   - If an official judge:
     - If the judge is G. Hamada, predict Trinidad (0)
     - Otherwise, predict de la Hoya (1)

4. Finally, it returns the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node truth values.

This function adheres to the provided feature encodings and target variable encoding, and maintains the structure of the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.
