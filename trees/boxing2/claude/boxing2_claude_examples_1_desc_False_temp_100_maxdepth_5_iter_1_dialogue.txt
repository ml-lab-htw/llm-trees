Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses sensible thresholds and follows the exact feature names and value ranges you specified:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes with conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0  # Split on official vs non-official judges
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Early rounds vs late rounds
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0     # Check if judge is G. Hamada
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 7     # Check if judge is Associated Press
    
    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Non-official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[4]:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            if nodes[3]:  # G. Hamada
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Uses the exact feature names provided: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'
3. Returns both the prediction (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values for each decision node
4. Uses realistic thresholds based on the feature descriptions
5. Incorporates the specified encoding for judges (0-10), official status (0-1), an
