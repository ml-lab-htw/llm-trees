Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function with a maximum depth of 2. I'll use the exact feature keys and encodings you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge code 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Second node splits based on different conditions depending on first node
    if nodes[0]:
        # For HBO-Lederman, split on Round
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    else:
        # For other judges, split on Official status
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Make prediction based on decision tree paths
    if nodes[0]:  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Other judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Non-official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list to store the boolean values of the two decision nodes
2. First node checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge code 3)
3. Second node has different conditions based on the first split:
   - For HBO-Lederman: splits on Round <= 6
   - For other judges: splits on Official status
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree follows the structure we discussed earlier while using the exact feature keys and encodings provided.
