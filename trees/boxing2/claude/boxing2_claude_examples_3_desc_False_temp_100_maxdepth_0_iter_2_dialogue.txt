Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the given specifications, here's the Python function that predicts which boxer won each round and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 3.5
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 2  # J. Roth

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else node for node in nodes]
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features as input. It then evaluates the conditions for each node in the decision tree and makes a prediction based on these conditions.

The function returns two values:
1. The prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
2. A list of the truth values of the inner nodes, where 1 means the condition is satisfied, 0 means it's not, and None means the node wasn't evaluated.

Note that I've made some assumptions to fill in specific thresholds:
- For the "Official" feature, I used 0.5 as the threshold, which effectively separates 0 (No) and 1 (Yes).
- For the "Judge" feature, I used exact equality to check for specific judges (HBO-Lederman is 3, J. Roth is 2).
- For the "Round" feature, I used 6.5 and 3.5 as
