Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 7
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the boolean values of decision points
2. First checks if it's an official judge (nodes[0])
3. For unofficial judges, checks if it's HBO-Lederman (nodes[1])
4. For official judges, checks if it's before or after round 7 (nodes[2])
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions

The decision points are based on:
- Official/unofficial judge split
- HBO-Lederman's known scoring tendencies
- The round number (early vs late rounds)
- Associated Press as a specific influential unofficial scorer

This tree captures the general pattern of de la Hoya being favored in early rounds and by certain judges, while Trinidad tended to get more favorable scoring in later rounds.
