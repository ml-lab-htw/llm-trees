Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won the round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 0  # Is not official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Is early round
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Not official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates three key decision nodes based on:
   - Whether the judge is official or not
   - Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman
   - Whether it's an early round (â‰¤6) or late round (>6)

2. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node

3. Follows the general pattern of the fight where:
   - Official judges scored differently from unofficial observers
   - HBO-Lederman had a distinct scoring pattern
   - Early rounds typically went to de la Hoya
   - Later rounds typically went to Trinidad

The function takes a dictionary X with the features "Judge", "Official", and "Round" as input and returns both the prediction and the state of the decision nodes.
