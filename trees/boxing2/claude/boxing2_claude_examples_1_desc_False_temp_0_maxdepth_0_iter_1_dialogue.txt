Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won a round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 7
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates three decision nodes checking:
   - If it's not an official judge (Official <= 0)
   - If it's HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
   - If it's an early round (Round <= 7)

2. Returns:
   - A prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
   - A list of boolean values representing the truth values of each decision node

The tree reflects the general pattern where:
- Official judges tended to score early rounds for de la Hoya and later rounds for Trinidad
- HBO-Lederman and Associated Press had a tendency to score for de la Hoya
- Other unofficial judges tended to score for Trinidad

This implementation maintains the exact feature names and encodings as provided in the feature description.
