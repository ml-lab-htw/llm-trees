Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function with a maximum depth of 2. The tree will use the Judge and Round features as the main decision nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if judge is one of the official judges (Hamada, Logist, or Roth)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2  # Official judges have IDs 0, 1, and 2
    
    # Second node: For unofficial judges, check round number
    # For official judges, check if they are marked as official
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] <= 0
    
    # Make prediction based on decision tree paths
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judges (0-2)
        if nodes[1]:  # Early rounds (1-6)
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Later rounds (7-12)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Unofficial judges (3-10)
        if nodes[1]:  # Not marked as official
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Marked as official
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. Uses Judge ≤ 2 as the first split to separate official judges from unofficial judges
2. For official judges (Judge ≤ 2), uses Round ≤ 6 to separate early rounds (favoring de la Hoya) from later rounds (favoring Trinidad)
3. For unofficial judges (Judge > 2), uses the Official status as the final decision criterion

The predictions are encoded as:
- 0 for Trinidad
- 1 for de la Hoya

The nodes list contains two boolean values representing whether each condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0).
