Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree and returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # For our three decision nodes
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Is it HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Is it G. Hamada?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Is it in first half of the fight?
    
    # Tree traversal
    if not nodes[0]:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Is G. Hamada
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Other judges
            if nodes[2]:  # First half of fight
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Second half of fight
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses exact feature names as provided
2. Follows the target encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
3. Uses the proper encoding for judges (3 = HBO-Lederman, 0 = G. Hamada)
4. Makes logical splits based on the round number (â‰¤6 for first half of fight)
5. Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions
6. Implements the same tree structure as previously described, but with exact values and proper encodings
