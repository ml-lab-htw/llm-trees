Based on your requirements, I'll create a function that implements the decision tree with the specified features and encoding, using 'Official' as the key splitting feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # if not an official judge
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # if official judge
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary `X` with the feature names as keys
- Creates a list `nodes` with one element (as we only have one split for depth=1)
- Uses the 'Official' feature with a threshold of 0.5 (which makes sense as Official is binary: 0=No, 1=Yes)
- Returns:
  - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
  - nodes: list with one boolean value indicating if X["Official"] <= 0.5

The mapping aligns with your specified encoding:
- Target: 0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya
- Official: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
