Based on the given information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for the boxing match:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 2.5 if nodes[0] else X["Judge"] <= 2.5
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] <= 1.5 if nodes[0] else X["Judge"] <= 1.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The first split is based on whether the judge is official or not (`Official <= 0.5`).
2. For unofficial judges (media/others), we split based on the specific judge or source (`Judge <= 2.5`).
3. For official judges, we split based on which of the three official judges it is (`Judge <= 1.5`).

The thresholds are chosen based on the encoding provided:
- `Official`: 0.5 separates unofficial (0) from official (1) judges.
- `Judge`: 2.5 separates the first three judges (official) from the rest (unofficial).
- `Judge`: 1.5 further splits the official judges.

Note that the `Round` feature is not used in this decision tree, as it wasn't deemed as important as the judge and officiality features for predicting the round winner.

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This implementation follows the structure of the examples provided, with a depth of 2 and using the most relevant features for classification.
