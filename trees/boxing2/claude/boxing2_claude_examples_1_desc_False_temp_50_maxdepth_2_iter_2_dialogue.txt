I'll create a Python function for the boxing decision tree classifier based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5 if nodes[0] else X["Round"] <= 8.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Non-official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6.5
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6.5
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 8.5
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 8.5
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the features as input
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean results of the decision conditions
3. First checks if the judge is non-official (Official <= 0.5)
4. Then checks the Round number with different thresholds depending on whether the judge is official or not
5. Returns a tuple containing:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds used are:
- Official: 0.5 (splits between official and non-official judges)
- Round: 6.5 for non-official judges, 8.5 for official judges
