Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the Judge feature as the main splitting criterion with suitable thresholds. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth-1 tree
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 3  # Split between official judges/HBO vs media outlets
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
- Uses a single decision node (depth-1 tree)
- Splits based on Judge values (≤ 3 includes G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth, and HBO-Lederman)
- Returns 0 (Trinidad) for official judges and HBO-Lederman
- Returns 1 (de la Hoya) for most media outlets
- Returns both the prediction and the list of node conditions
- Follows the target encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
- Uses only the exact feature names provided
- Returns a simple and interpretable decision structure

The threshold of 3 was chosen because it creates a meaningful split between official judges plus HBO-Lederman (≤ 3) versus other media outlets (> 3).
