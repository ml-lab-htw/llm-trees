I'll create a decision tree function based on the provided features and target encoding for the Trinidad vs. de la Hoya fight classification. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Associated Press
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 2  # J. Roth

    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Is Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Is an official judge
        if nodes[3]:  # Is J. Roth
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 0:  # Is G. Hamada
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 4 nodes to store the boolean conditions
2. Evaluates key decision points based on whether the judge is official and which specific judge/media outlet is scoring
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree primarily splits on:
- Whether the judge is official or not
- Key judges/media outlets (HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, J. Roth, G. Hamada)

The nodes list captures the truth values of:
1. Whether the judge is non-official
2. Whether it's HBO-Lederman
3. Whether it's Associated Press
4. Whether it's J. Roth

Each node will be 1 if the condition is true, 0 if false.
