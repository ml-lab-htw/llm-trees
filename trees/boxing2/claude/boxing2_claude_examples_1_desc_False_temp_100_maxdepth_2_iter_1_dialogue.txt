Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the official judges (0, 1, 2) and their official status as the main decision factors. Here's the prediction function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Check if it's one of the official judges (Hamada, Logist, or Roth)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    # Check if they're scoring in official capacity
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Is one of the official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Scoring in official capacity
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # Not an official judge
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is one of the three official judges (Hamada, Logist, or Roth) by checking if Judge <= 2
2. Then checks if they're scoring in their official capacity (Official == 1)
3. Makes predictions favoring Trinidad (0) when it's an official judge scoring in official capacity, and de la Hoya (1) otherwise

The function returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the evaluation of each node's condition.
