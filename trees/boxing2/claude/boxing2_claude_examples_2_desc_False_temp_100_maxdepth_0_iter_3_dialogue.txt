Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I previously suggested, here's a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for the boxing match between Trinidad and de la Hoya:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada

    if nodes[0]:  # Unofficial judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 3 else 0  # HBO-Lederman's decision
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6.5
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[3]:  # G. Hamada
            prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 0 else 0  # G. Hamada's decision
        elif X["Judge"] == 1:  # B. Logist
            prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 1 else 0  # B. Logist's decision
        else:
            prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 2 else 0  # J. Roth's decision

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 0 for Trinidad winning the round, 1 for de la Hoya winning the round.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following logic:
1. First, it checks if the judge is official or unofficial.
2. For unofficial judges:
   - If it's HBO-Lederman, it uses their decision.
   - For other unofficial sources, it bases the decision on the round number, favoring de la Hoya in earlier rounds (1
