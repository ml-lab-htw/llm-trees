Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won a round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Not official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 7
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates three key decision nodes based on:
   - Whether the judge is official or not
   - Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman
   - Whether the round is in the first or second half of the fight

2. Uses the following logic:
   - For unofficial judges (Official <= 0):
     - If it's HBO-Lederman → de la Hoya wins
     - If it's Associated Press → de la Hoya wins
     - Otherwise → Trinidad wins
   - For official judges (Official > 0):
     - If it's rounds 1-7 → de la Hoya wins
     - If it's rounds 8-12 → Trinidad wins

3. Returns both:
   - The prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
   - The list of boolean values for each decision node

The thresholds used are based on the provided feature encodings and the general narrative of the fight where de la Hoya was stronger in early rounds and Trinidad dominated the later rounds.
