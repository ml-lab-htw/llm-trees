Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and the desired format, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node since max_depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If not an official judge
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If official judge
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature name "Official" as provided
2. Uses the correct target encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
3. Has a single decision node since max_depth=1
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of node conditions
5. Uses the provided encoding for the "Official" feature (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

The decision rule mirrors the tree structure shown earlier, where unofficial judges (Official <= 0.5) tend to score for de la Hoya (1), while official judges (Official > 0.5) tend to score for Trinidad (0).
