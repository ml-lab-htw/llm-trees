Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the features to predict the winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and returns the node decisions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Create list for storing node decisions
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 2  # J. Roth
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 1  # B. Logist
    
    # Tree logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # Non-official judge
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if not nodes[1]:  # Not J. Roth
            if not nodes[2]:  # Not B. Logist
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is official
2. For official judges, checks if it's J. Roth or B. Logist
3. For non-official judges, checks if it's HBO-Lederman or Associated Press
4. Makes predictions based on these conditions (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)

The nodes list stores three boolean values corresponding to:
1. Whether the judge is official
2. Whether the judge is J. Roth
3. Whether the judge is B. Logist
