Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and requirements, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree we discussed:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node since max_depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If not an official judge
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    else:  # If official judge
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the features
2. Creates a list 'nodes' to store the truth values of the conditions
3. Uses the "Official" feature as the main decision node
4. Returns a prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions
5. Follows the specified feature names and target encoding exactly

The decision tree uses only one node since we specified max_depth=1, and it uses the "Official" feature as it was the most discriminative feature in this historical fight's scoring pattern.
