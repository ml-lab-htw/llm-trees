Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows your format and uses the exact feature names:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: checks if it's an official judge (judges 0, 1, or 2)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    
    # Second node: for official judges, checks if it's an early round
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge (Hamada, Logist, or Roth)
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's rounds 1-6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If it's rounds 7-12
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If it's a non-official judge (media)
        prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with the features as keys
- Uses the exact feature names provided: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'
- Returns predictions encoded as specified (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
- Returns a list of boolean values for the inner nodes
- Makes logical splits based on the historical context of the fight

The first split checks if the judge is one of the three official judges (Judge <= 2), and the second split checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6).
