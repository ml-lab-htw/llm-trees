Based on the given information and the decision tree structure I proposed earlier, I'll create a Python function that predicts the winner of each round and returns the prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Yes
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 2  # J. Roth
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes into account the following:

1. The round number (early rounds â‰¤ 6, later rounds > 6)
2. Specific judges (HBO-Lederman and J. Roth)
3. Whether the judge is official or not

The function returns:
- A prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
- A list of 5 boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Remember that this is a simplified model based on the earlier decision tree, and its accuracy would depend on how well it reflects the actual fight data. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to train and validate this model using the complete dataset to ensure its reliability.
