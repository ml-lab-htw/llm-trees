Based on the given information and requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxer won each round. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 2  # J. Roth
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 9
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 1  # B. Logist

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names ('Judge', 'Official', 'Round') and the values are the corresponding feature values.

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

The decision tree is implemented using nested if-else statements based on the structure we discussed earlier. The thresholds and conditions are set according to the feature descriptions provided.

Note that this implementation assumes that the 'Judge' feature is encoded as integers (0 for G. Hamada, 1 for B. Logist, 2 for J. Roth, etc.) as per the description. The 'Official' feature
