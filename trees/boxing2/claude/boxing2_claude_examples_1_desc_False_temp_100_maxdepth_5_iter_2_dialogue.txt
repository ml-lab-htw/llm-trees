Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the boxing match decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Associated Press
    
    # Tree logic
    if not nodes[0]:  # If not HBO-Lederman
        if not nodes[1]:  # If not official judge
            if not nodes[3]:  # If not Associated Press
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 4 nodes to store the boolean conditions
3. Evaluates the conditions based on the feature values
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the actual feature names and encodings as specified
6. Makes logical splits based on the judges' identities, whether they're official judges, and the round number
7. Follows the pattern that de la Hoya was generally favored in early rounds (â‰¤6) while Trinidad was stronger in later rounds
