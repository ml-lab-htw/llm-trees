Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function with a maximum depth of 2. I'll use the exact feature keys and encodings you provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Second node: For HBO-Lederman branch, check if it's early rounds (â‰¤6)
    # For non-HBO-Lederman branch, check if it's an official judge
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Make prediction based on decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean conditions
3. First node checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
4. Second node depends on the first split:
   - If HBO-Lederman: checks if Round <= 6
   - If not HBO-Lederman: checks if Official == 1
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions

The decision tree follows the structure we discussed earlier, using the exact feature encodings provided.
