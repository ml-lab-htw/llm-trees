Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function. The tree will use the 'Official' and 'Round' features as the main splitting criteria, as these seem to be the most important factors.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: Is the judge official?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Second split: Round number threshold
    # For non-official judges
    if not nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    # For official judges
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 8
    
    # Make prediction (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Early rounds (≤ 8)
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Late rounds (> 8)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Non-official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Early rounds (≤ 6)
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Late rounds (> 6)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. First checks if the judge is official (nodes[0])
2. Then uses different round thresholds depending on whether the judge is official or not (nodes[1])
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions
4. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the common narrative that de la Hoya dominated early rounds while Trinidad was stronger in later rounds
5. Takes into account that official judges might have slightly different round-by-round scoring patterns compared to unofficial judges/media

The function expects a dictionary X with the exact keys: 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round', where the values follow the encoding specified in the feature description.
