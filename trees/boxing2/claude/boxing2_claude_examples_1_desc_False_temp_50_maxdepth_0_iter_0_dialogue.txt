Based on the provided features and target encoding for the Trinidad vs. de la Hoya fight, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree and returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2  # Official judges (Hamada, Logist, Roth) vs others
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Early rounds vs late rounds
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge vs media
    
    # Implement the decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge is one of the official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            if nodes[2]:  # Is official judge
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Judge is from media
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 8
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 8
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the boolean conditions
3. Evaluates three key decision points:
   - Whether the judge is one of the official judges (≤ 2)
   - Whether the round is in the early part of the fight (≤ 6)
   - Whether it's an official judge (== 1)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition

The thresholds are based on the provided feature encodings and the apparent shift in momentum during the fight, with official judges and later rounds favoring Trinidad, while media judges and earlier rounds favored de la Hoya.
