Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won a round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 7
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 3 nodes to store the boolean values of decision points
2. Checks first if it's not an official judge (Official <= 0)
3. For unofficial judges, checks if it's HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
4. For official judges, uses Round 7 as the splitting point
5. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions

The decision points are based on:
- Whether the judge is official or not
- The specific identity of unofficial judges (particularly HBO-Lederman and Associated Press)
- The round number (with Round 7 as the turning point)

This reflects the general pattern where de la Hoya was favored in early rounds and by certain judges, while Trinidad was favored in later rounds and by other judges.
