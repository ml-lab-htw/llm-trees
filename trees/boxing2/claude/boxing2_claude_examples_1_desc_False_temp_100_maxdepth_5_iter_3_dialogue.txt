Based on the provided feature encodings and target variable, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that classifies rounds between Trinidad (0) and de la Hoya (1):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing condition results
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Early rounds
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0     # Is it Judge Hamada?
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9     # Before final rounds
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 4     # Very early rounds

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            if nodes[2]:  # Hamada
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Round > 6
            if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 9
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Media judges
        if nodes[4]:  # Round <= 4
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First splits on whether the judge is official or not
2. Then considers different round thresholds
3. Takes into account specific judge tendencies (particularly Hamada)
4. Generally favors de la Hoya (1) in early rounds and Trinidad (0) in later rounds
5. Has different thresholds for official judges vs media judges

The function returns both:
- The prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
- A list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the inner nodes
