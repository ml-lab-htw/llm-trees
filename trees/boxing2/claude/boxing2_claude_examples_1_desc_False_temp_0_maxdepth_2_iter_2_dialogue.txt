Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, now properly formatted with the exact feature keys and encodings.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # First node: Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge code 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    # Second node: For HBO-Lederman's scoring, check if it's early rounds (â‰¤6)
    # For other judges, check if they're official
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6 if nodes[0] else X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Other judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Non-official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features "Judge", "Official", and "Round"
2. Returns a tuple containing:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of two boolean values representing the conditions at each node
3. Uses the exact feature encodings provided:
   - Judge: 3 represents HBO-Lederman
   - Official: 1 for Yes, 0 for No
   - Round: 1-12 (using threshold of 6)

The tree first splits on whether the judge is HBO-Lederman, then either:
- For HBO-Lederman: splits on whether it's round 6 or earlier
- For other judges: splits on whether they're official judges
