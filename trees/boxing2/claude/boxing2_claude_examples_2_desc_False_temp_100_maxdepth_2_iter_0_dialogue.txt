Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the provided format, here's the Python function that predicts which boxer won each round and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is one of the three official judges
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if it's the first half of the fight
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        nodes[2] = None
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # Node 2: Check if it's an official judge's scorecard
        nodes[1] = None
        nodes[2] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
        
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:
1. The function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values.
2. We initialize a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. The first node checks if the judge is one of the three official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth).
4. If it's an official judge (Judge <= 2):
   - We check if it's the first half of the fight (Round <= 6).
   - If it's the first half, de la Hoya wins (1); otherwise, Trinidad wins (0).
5. If it's not an official judge (Judge > 2):
   - We check if it's an official judge's scorecard (Official <= 0.5).
   - If it's not an official scorecard, Trinidad wins (0); otherwise, de la Hoya wins (1).
6. The function returns the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node truth values.

Note: The `nodes` list will always have one `
