Based on the provided features and target encoding for the Trinidad vs. de la Hoya fight, I'll create a decision tree prediction function. I'll use the tree structure from before but adapt it to the exact feature names and encodings provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 0  # Is this a non-official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Is this HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Is this in the first half of the fight?

    # Tree traversal logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Non-official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # First half of fight
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the feature values
2. Creates a list of boolean values for each decision node
3. Uses the following decision structure:
   - First checks if the judge is non-official
   - For non-official judges, considers HBO-Lederman and Associated Press separately
   - For official judges, uses the round number to make the decision
4. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node decisions

The thresholds used are based on the provided feature encodings:
- Official: 0 for non-official, 1 for official
- Judge: 3 for HBO-Lederman, 7 for Associated Press
- Round: Split at round 6 (first half vs second half of the fight)
