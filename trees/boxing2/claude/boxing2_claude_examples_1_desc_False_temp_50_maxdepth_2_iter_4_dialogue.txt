Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that matches the structure I proposed earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Is it Judge Hamada?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Is it in the first 6 rounds?
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's Hamada
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If it's not Hamada
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's rounds 1-6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If it's rounds 7-12
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the features
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean values of the decision conditions
3. First checks if the judge is Hamada (Judge == 0)
4. Then checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6)
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node

The thresholds used are:
- First node: Judge == 0 (Hamada)
- Second node: Round <= 6 (first half of the fight)

This matches the original narrative where Hamada generally favored Trinidad, and de la Hoya was stronger in the early rounds while Trinidad dominated the later rounds.
