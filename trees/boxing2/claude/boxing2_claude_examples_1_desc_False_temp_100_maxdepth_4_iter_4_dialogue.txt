Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won a round, along with the node conditions.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list to store boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 8
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Non-official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 8
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 8
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree implementation:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as keys
2. Uses the exact feature names provided
3. Follows the target encoding (0 = Trinidad, 1 = de la Hoya)
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for each decision node
5. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions
6. Has a maximum depth of 4
7. Focuses on the most important features: Official status, Judge identity (specifically HBO-Lederman), and Round number

The tree captures the pattern that official judges tend to favor de la Hoya in earlier rounds and Trinidad in later rounds, while incorporating the influence of specific judges (particularly HBO-Lederman) in non-official scoring.
