Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree I described earlier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize list for 5 inner nodes
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 4
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 4
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:  # Round > 4
                if nodes[4]:  # Round > 9
                    prediction = 0  # Trinidad
                else:  # Round <= 9
                    prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 5 boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node
3. Returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node conditions
4. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided
5. Has a maximum depth of 5
6. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the boxing context
