Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Trinidad (0) or de la Hoya (1) won a round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Tree traversal and prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates three main decision nodes based on:
   - Whether the judge is official or not
   - Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman
   - Whether the round is in the first or second half of the fight

2. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node

3. Follows the general narrative of the fight where:
   - Official judges scored differently from unofficial observers
   - HBO-Lederman had a distinct scoring pattern
   - Early rounds (1-6) favored de la Hoya
   - Later rounds (7-12) favored Trinidad

The thresholds used are based on the provided feature encodings and the natural break point in the 12-round fight (Round 6 as the midpoint).
