Based on the decision tree I proposed earlier and the additional information you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2  # G. Hamada, B. Logist, J. Roth are 0, 1, 2
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The first node checks if the Judge is one of the three official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth).
2. If it's one of these judges, we then check if it's the first half of the fight (Round <= 6.5).
3. If it's not one of these judges, we check if it's an official judge or not.
4. The prediction is made based on these conditions, with 0 representing Trinidad and 1 representing de la Hoya.

This function takes a dictionary `X` with the features and returns a tuple containing the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Note that this tree is based on the hypothetical relationships we discussed earlier. In a real scenario, the tree structure and thresholds would be determined by analyzing actual data and using machine learning algorithms to find the most discriminative features and split points.
