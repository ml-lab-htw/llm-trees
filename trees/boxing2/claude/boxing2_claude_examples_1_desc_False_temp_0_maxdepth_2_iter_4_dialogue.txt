Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function with a maximum depth of 2. I'll use the Judge (specifically HBO-Lederman = 3) and Round features as the main decision nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node: Is the judge HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Second decision node: Is it an early round (≤ 6)?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If early round (≤ 6)
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:  # If late round (> 6)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:  # If not HBO-Lederman
        if X["Official"] == 1:  # If official judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:  # If not official judge
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X containing the features
2. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean values of decisions
3. First checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge = 3)
4. Then checks if it's an early round (Round ≤ 6)
5. Returns:
   - prediction: 0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya
   - nodes: list of boolean values representing the decision path

The decision tree reflects that:
- HBO-Lederman tended to score early rounds for de la Hoya and later rounds for Trinidad
- Official judges generally favored Trinidad
- Non-official judges (media) generally favored de la Hoya
