Based on the decision tree I created and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0  # 0 represents G. Hamada

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. The first node checks if the judge is not an official judge (Official <= 0.5).

3. The second node checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6.5).

4. The third node checks if the judge is G. Hamada (Judge == 0).

5. Based on these conditions, it predicts the winner:
   - For non-official judges (nodes[0] is True):
     - In earlier rounds (nodes[1] is True), it predicts de la Hoya (1)
     - In later rounds (nodes[1] is False), it predicts Trinidad (0)
   - For official judges (nodes[0] is False):
     - If the judge is G. Hamada (nodes[2] is True), it predicts Trinidad (0)
     - For other judges (nodes[2] is False), it predicts de la Hoya (1)

6. The function returns the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier, using the exact keys and encodings provided in your instructions.
