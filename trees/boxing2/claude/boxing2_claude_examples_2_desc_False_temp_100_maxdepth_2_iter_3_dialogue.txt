Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided information, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if the judge is one of the official judges
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2  # G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node for non-official judges: Check the round number
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        # Second node for official judges: Check if it's an official judge
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] <= 0
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree with a depth of 2, as requested. It uses the most important features to classify which boxer (Trinidad or de la Hoya) won each round. Here's how it works:

1. The first split checks if the judge is one of the three official judges (G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth). These are represented by Judge values 0, 1, and 2.

2. For non-official judges (Judge > 2), it then checks the round number. If the round is 6 or earlier, it predicts de la Hoya won; otherwise, it predicts Trinidad won.

3. For official judges (Judge <= 2), it checks if the judge is actually an official judge (Official = 1). If not, it predicts de la Hoya won; if so, it predicts Trinidad won.

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

This implementation adheres to the feature keys and encodings provided, and uses meaningful thresholds based on the given
