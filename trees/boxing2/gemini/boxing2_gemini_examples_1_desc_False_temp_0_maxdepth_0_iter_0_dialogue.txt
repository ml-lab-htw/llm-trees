**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Structure:** The function now reflects a decision tree structure, using nested `if/elif/else` statements to represent the branches.
* **Thresholds:**  I've added placeholder thresholds (e.g., `X["Judge"] == 2`, `X["Round"] > 8`).  These would need to be learned from data in a real application.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each inner node (1 if true, 0 if false), as requested.
* **Handling Other Judges:** The code includes a rudimentary way to handle judges not explicitly included in the first few splits. In a real application, a more robust approach might involve further splits or probabilistic predictions.
* **Data-Driven Approach:**  This is a *hypothetical* tree. To build an accurate model, you'd need a dataset of round-by-round scores with the winner of each round, train a decision tree algorithm on that data, and then extract the logic to create the `predict` function.


**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}  # J. Roth, Official, Round 5
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Trinidad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True, False, False, False]

X = {"Judge": 4, "Official": 0, "Round": 10} # Sportsticker, Unofficial, Round 10
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: Prediction: 1 (De La Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, False, True, True]
