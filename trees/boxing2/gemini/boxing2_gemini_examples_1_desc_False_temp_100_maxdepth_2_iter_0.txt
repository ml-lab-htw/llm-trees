    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # Split based on Judge (first half vs second half of possible values)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Split based on Round (first half vs second half of possible rounds)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 #  Assumption: Early rounds, judges 0-5 favor Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Assumption: Later rounds, judges 0-5 favor De La Hoya
    else:

**Explanation of the generated decision tree:**

The generated decision tree uses the provided features "Judge" and "Round" to make a prediction about who won the round.  Since no training data was provided, the specific splits and predictions are based on reasonable assumptions.  

* **First Split (Node 0):** The tree first splits based on the "Judge" feature, using a threshold of 5.  This effectively divides the judges into two groups: those with lower IDs (0-5) and those with higher IDs (6-10).  This split could represent a potential bias between different judging panels.

* **Second Split (Node 1):**  If the judge's ID is less than or equal to 5 (Node 0 is True), the tree then splits based on the "Round" feature, using a threshold of 6.  This divides the fight into the first half (rounds 1-6) and the second half (rounds 7-12).

* **Predictions:**
    * If the judge's ID is less than or equal to 5 and the round is less than or equal to 6 (both nodes are True), the prediction is 0 (Trinidad).
    * If the judge's ID is less than or equal to 5 and the round is greater than 6 (Node 0 is True, Node 1 is False), the prediction is 1 (De La Hoya).
    * If the judge's ID is greater than 5 (Node 0 is False), the prediction is 1 (De La Hoya), regardless of the round.


This tree structure represents a simplified hypothetical scenario. With real boxing data, a much more complex and accurate tree could be trained.  The assumptions made here are purely for demonstration purposes in the absence of training data.  The important part is that the code generates a valid decision tree function with a maximum depth of 2, using the specified features, and returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values as requested.
