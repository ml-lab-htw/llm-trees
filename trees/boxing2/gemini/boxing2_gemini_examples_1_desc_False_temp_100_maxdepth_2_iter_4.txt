```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Assuming Trinidad more likely to win early rounds with these judges
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Assuming de la Hoya more likely to win later rounds with these judges
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Assuming de la Hoya favored by other judges

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Reasoning for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

Since we are building the decision tree without training data, we have to make some reasonable assumptions.  I've chosen "Judge" and "Round" as the most important features based on the following hypothetical scenario:

* **Judge Subjectivity:**  Different judges might have different scoring tendencies.  Some judges might favor a particular fighter or style.  Therefore, "Judge" is chosen as a key splitting feature.  The threshold of 5 is arbitrary,  dividing the judges into two hypothetical groups.  One could imagine judges 0-5 being more inclined towards one fighter and judges 6-10 leaning towards the other.

* **Round Dynamics:**  The dynamic of a boxing match can change over the rounds.  A fighter might start strong and fade later or vice versa. Hence, "Round" is chosen as the second feature. The threshold of 6 divides the match into early and late rounds.


**Without training data, the specific thresholds and predictions within the tree are essentially guesses.** The goal is to demonstrate the structure of a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, utilizing the provided features and making plausible assumptions about their influence. The function accurately represents the conditional logic of such a decision tree.  A real-world decision tree would be trained on data to determine the optimal features, thresholds, and predictions.
