You're asking to create a Python function that represents a decision tree classifier for predicting the winner of a boxing round based on judge scores. You want the function to:

* Take a dictionary of features as input.
* Return the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

**Here's the Python function incorporating your requirements:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """Predicts the winner of a boxing round using a decision tree.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): 0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya.
            nodes (list): List of truth values (0 or 1) for inner nodes.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize with None for clarity
    
    # Node 1: Is the judge an Official (1=Yes, 0=No)?
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1 

    # Node 2: If Official, is it Round 1-6 (assuming early rounds favor one fighter)?
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6 if nodes[0] else False  

    # Node 3: Placeholder -  Needs more data/domain knowledge to determine a split 
    # Example:  Is the judge known to favor a specific fighter? 
    nodes[2] =  X['Judge'] in [0, 2, 5] if nodes[1] else False # Example: Judges 0, 2, 5 favor De La Hoya

    # Prediction Logic: This is a simplified example and needs refinement
    if nodes[0] and nodes[1] and nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins if Official, early round, and judge favors him
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Otherwise, Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example Usage:
test_features = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3} 
prediction, nodes = predict(test_features)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  We create a list `nodes` with a size corresponding to the maximum possible inner nodes (depth 2 could have up to 3 inner nodes). We initialize it with `None` for clarity.
2. **Node Conditions:**
   - `nodes[0]`:  Checks if the judge is an official judge (`X['Official'] == 1`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the round is between 1 and 6 (`X['Round'] <= 6`) **only if** the judge is official (`nodes[0]`).
   - `nodes[2]`:  **Placeholder:** This node needs a more meaningful condition. I've added an example, but you'll need more data or domain knowledge to determine the best split. 
3. **Prediction:** The prediction logic is very basic in this example. It assigns a win to De La Hoya if all three node conditions are met; otherwise, it predicts Trinidad as the winner. You'll likely need to adjust this based on your data analysis.

**Important Notes:**

* **Placeholder Node:**  You need to replace the condition for `nodes[2]` with a more meaningful condition based on your data analysis or boxing knowledge.
* **Prediction Logic:** The provided logic is extremely simplified. A real-world decision tree would likely have more complex prediction logic based on the relationships found in your data.
* **Data Required:** To build a truly effective decision tree, you'll need a substantial dataset of round-by-round judge scores and the actual winners to train and evaluate the model.

Remember that this is a starting point. You'll need to experiment with different features, thresholds, and prediction logic to create a more accurate decision tree classifier.
