def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    judges_for_trinidad = [0, 2, 3] # G. Hamada, J. Roth, HBO-Lederman

    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in judges_for_trinidad  # First split: Judge group
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4  # Second split: Round <= 4 (only applies within first branch)


    if nodes[0]: # Favors Trinidad group
        if nodes[1]: # Early rounds
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad
        else: # Later rounds
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya
    else: # Other Judges
        if X["Official"] == 1:  # Official Judges
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya
        else: # Unofficial Judges
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad
    
    nodes = [int(n) for n in nodes] # Convert boolean to integer for the list
    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
example_1 = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 0, "Round": 3}
prediction_1, nodes_1 = predict(example_1)
print(f"Prediction 1: {prediction_1}, Nodes 1: {nodes_1}")

example_2 = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 8}
prediction_2, nodes_2 = predict(example_2)
print(f"Prediction 2: {prediction_2}, Nodes 2: {nodes_2}")


example_3 = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction_3, nodes_3 = predict(example_3)
print(f"Prediction 3: {prediction_3}, Nodes 3: {nodes_3}")



example_4 = {"Judge": 4, "Official": 0, "Round": 2}
prediction_4, nodes_4 = predict(example_4)
print(f"Prediction 4: {prediction_4}, Nodes 4: {nodes_4}")

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Judge Encoding:** The `Judge` feature is handled using numerical encoding as provided in the prompt (0-10).  The `judges_for_trinidad` list now uses these numeric values.
* **Boolean to Integer:** The `nodes` list is now explicitly converted to integers (0 or 1) to match the requested format.
* **Clearer Logic:** The conditional statements are reorganized to more closely mirror the decision tree's structure, improving readability.
* **Example Usage:** The provided examples demonstrate how to use the function and interpret the output.



This revised code provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree logic, adhering to the specified format and addressing the previous issues. It's ready to be tested with various input combinations. Remember that this is a hypothetical example; a real-world model would need training with actual boxing data.
