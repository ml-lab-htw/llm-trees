This code creates a decision tree function `predict(X)` that takes a dictionary of features `X` as input. The tree has a maximum depth of 4 (with 10 inner nodes, which is within the requested range of 4-15).  The conditions in the tree are based on the provided features ("Judge", "Official", and "Round"), and the thresholds are arbitrarily chosen (but attempt to create a somewhat balanced tree).  The prediction (0 for Trinidad or 1 for de la Hoya) is determined by traversing the tree based on the input features.  The function returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values (`nodes`) representing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.


It's important to remember that this decision tree is generated *without training*.  Therefore, its performance on actual data is likely to be poor.  To create a useful decision tree, you'll need to train it using a suitable machine learning algorithm with real data.  This example demonstrates the requested structure and formatting of the function.
