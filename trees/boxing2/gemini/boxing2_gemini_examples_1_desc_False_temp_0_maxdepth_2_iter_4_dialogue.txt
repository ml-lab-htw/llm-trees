def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6.5  # Splitting rounds roughly in half
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 5.5 # Splitting judges roughly in half (hypothetical example)


    if nodes[0]: # First half of the rounds
        if nodes[1]: # First group of judges
            prediction = 0 # Assume Trinidad wins early rounds with these judges
        else: # Second group of judges
            prediction = 1 # Assume De La Hoya wins early rounds with these judges
    else: # Second half of the rounds
        prediction = 1 # Assume De La Hoya wins later rounds regardless of judge.

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Thresholds:** The thresholds used (6.5 for Round and 5.5 for Judge) are *entirely hypothetical*.  Without actual data, it's impossible to know which features and thresholds would be most effective.  These values are chosen for illustrative purposes, suggesting a potential scenario where earlier rounds might favor one fighter and later rounds favor the other, and perhaps different groups of judges have slight biases.

* **Data Required for Real-World Application:** To build a useful decision tree, you *must* provide a dataset of round-by-round scoring with the winner indicated.  The tree's structure and thresholds will be learned from the data.

* **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature encoding for 'Judge' is numerical (0-10), which is suitable for the decision tree algorithm.  No further encoding is needed. "Official" is already binary.

* **Depth Limitation:** The code respects the maximum depth of 2.

* **Interpretation of `nodes` List:** The `nodes` list provides a trace of the decision path.  For example, if `nodes = [True, False]`, it means the first condition (`Round <= 6.5`) was met, but the second condition (`Judge <= 5.5`) was not.


Once you provide the data, I can generate a decision tree based on the actual patterns in the data, which will be far more accurate and meaningful than this hypothetical example.
