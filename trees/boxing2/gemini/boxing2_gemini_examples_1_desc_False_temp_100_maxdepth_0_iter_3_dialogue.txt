def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judges are more likely to agree
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Perhaps De La Hoya had stronger later rounds (hypothetical)

    if nodes[0]:  # If Official Judge
        if nodes[1]:  # and Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:  # and Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
    else: # If not Official Judge
        if X["Judge"] == 0: #If Judge is G. Hamada
             prediction = 0 #Trinidad Wins (hypothetical)
        else: #If judge is not G Hamada
             prediction = 1 #De La Hoya Wins (hypothetical)


    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Caveats:**

This function implements the hypothetical tree structure discussed earlier, making some assumptions about the potential importance of features.

* **`nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1`**: This checks if the judge is an official judge.  We hypothesize that official judges' decisions might be more reliable.

* **`nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6`**: This checks if the round is less than or equal to 6.  This splits the rounds into early and late, hypothesizing a difference in fighter performance.  The specific round cutoff (6) is a placeholder â€“ with real data, a decision tree algorithm would determine the optimal split point.

* **The predictions (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) at the leaf nodes are also placeholders.**  Without data, we can only guess. A trained decision tree would learn these mappings from the data.


**Crucially, this function is *not* trained. It's a demonstration of how to structure a decision tree function based on given features.  The actual logic and predictions would likely be very different with real data.**  Provide the data, and I can train a real decision tree for you.
