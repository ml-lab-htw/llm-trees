**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data-Driven Decisions:**  The provided example decision tree is purely illustrative. To create a meaningful tree, you *must* analyze your boxing data.  Look for patterns in how different judges score, the influence of the round number, and the impact of being an official judge.

2. **Thresholds:**  The example uses simple equality checks for categorical features and a threshold on the round number.  With more data analysis, you can find more informative splits.

3. **Complexity:**  The tree's depth and complexity will depend on the data. You might need a deeper tree or different splitting criteria.

4. **Scikit-learn:** For real-world applications, use the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn. This will handle the tree building, feature importance calculation, and other aspects automatically.


**Using Scikit-learn (Example):**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load your data into a pandas DataFrame (replace with your data loading)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Judge": [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2,  # ... more data
              ],
    "Official": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,  # ... more data
                 ],
    "Round": [1, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3,  # ... more data
              ],
    "Winner": [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,  # ... more data (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya)
               ]
})


X = data[["Judge", "Official", "Round"]]
y = data["Winner"]

# Create and train the decision tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)


# Function to predict and get node truth values (simplified example)
def predict_with_nodes(X_input):
    prediction = clf.predict([X_input])[0]
    # Getting node truth values is more complex with scikit-learn and
    # usually not necessary for prediction itself.  You can access the tree 
    # structure using clf.tree_ if you need deeper analysis.
    return prediction


# Example prediction
example_features = [2, 1, 8] # Judge, Official, Round
prediction = predict_with_nodes(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")



```
