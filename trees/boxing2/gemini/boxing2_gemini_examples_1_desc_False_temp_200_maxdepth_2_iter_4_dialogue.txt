def predict(X: dict):

    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
            - 'Judge': Judge (0-10 as defined in the prompt).
            - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
            - 'Round': Round number (1-12).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya)
               and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of inner nodes.

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Handling:** The code directly uses the provided feature keys ('Judge', 'Official', 'Round') and their specified encodings.
* **Thresholds:** The round split threshold is set to 6 (you can adjust this if you have insights into the fight). The "Judge == 3" (HBO-Lederman) is a hypothetical example;  a real tree would be built on data and could select a different judge.
* **Type Consistency:** The `nodes` list now contains integer (1 or 0) values, as requested.
* **Docstrings:**  Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose and arguments.
* **Example Usage:** Added example calls to demonstrate how to use the function.



Remember that this decision tree's logic is still hypothetical due to the lack of real data.  Once you have the round-by-round scoring data, you can train a true decision tree classifier to make more accurate predictions.
