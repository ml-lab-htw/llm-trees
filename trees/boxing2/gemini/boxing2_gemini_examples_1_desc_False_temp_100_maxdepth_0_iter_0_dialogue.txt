```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Check if round is in the first half

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge
        if X["Judge"] == 0: # Example: G. Hamada favors Trinidad
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:  # Not Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # First half of the fight
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad (Example - early momentum)
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya (Example - later momentum)

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Encoding:** I've directly used the feature encodings you provided (e.g., 1 for "Yes" for the "Official" judge, 0 to 10 for "Judge").
* **Meaningful Thresholds:** The thresholds (Round <= 6, Judge == 0) are now more illustrative, although still hypothetical. Real-world data would inform better splits.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The nested `if` structure clearly reflects the decision tree's branches.
* **No Data Required:** This function implements the *structure* of a decision tree, as requested, without needing training data. The specific predictions are placeholders based on reasonable assumptions but will need to be adjusted based on real-world performance.

**How to use it:**

```python
example_round = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}  # Example input
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)
print(f"Prediction (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Provide data:** To get a useful decision tree, you *must* provide data with the actual round winners for training.
2. **Use scikit-learn:** Once you have data, I can show you how to use `scikit-learn`'s `DecisionTreeClassifier` to train a real decision tree, which will be much more accurate than this hand-crafted example.  Scikit-learn will handle finding the optimal split points and feature selections for you.
