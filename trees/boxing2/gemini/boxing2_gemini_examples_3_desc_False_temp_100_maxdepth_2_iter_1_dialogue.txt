    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] <= 5.5  # Assuming judges are numerically encoded, split around the middle
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6.5 # Splitting the rounds in half

    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # And judge ID is in the first half
            prediction = 0  # Assume Trinidad is more likely to win (adjust based on data) 
        else:  # Judge ID in the second half
            prediction = 1  # Assume De La Hoya is more likely to win (adjust based on data)
    else: # If it's NOT an official judge 
        if nodes[2]: # First half of rounds
            prediction = 0 # Assume Trinidad more likely (again, adjust based on data)
        else: # Second half of rounds
            prediction = 1 # Assume De La Hoya more likely

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 `None` values to represent the truth values of each node in our decision tree.
2. **Root Node (Official Judge):**
   - `nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1`: This checks if the judge is an official judge. The `== 1` corresponds to "Yes".
3. **Left Subtree (Official Judge = True):**
   - `nodes[1] = X['Judge'] <= 5.5`: If the judge is official, we further split based on the judge's ID. Here, I've arbitrarily chosen 5.5 (midpoint) as a threshold. You'd ideally analyze your data to find a more meaningful split point.
   - Predictions are then made based on whether the judge falls into the first or second half of the ID range. The initial predictions (0 or 1) are placeholders -  **you MUST adjust these based on your data analysis**. 
4. **Right Subtree (Official Judge = False):**
   - `nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6.5`: For non-official judges, we split based on the round number. Again, 6.5 is an arbitrary split - you'll want to determine a better threshold.
   - Predictions for this branch are also placeholders and need to be adjusted.

**Important Notes:**

* **Data-Driven Decisions:**  The thresholds and predictions in this example function are based on assumptions and need to be replaced with values derived from your actual data analysis. 
* **Feature Importance:** The choice of features and split points should reflect the most important factors in determining the round winner based on your dataset. 
* **Tree Depth:**  A depth-2 tree might be too simplistic for this problem. Consider experimenting with deeper trees for better accuracy.

Remember, this is a starting point. You will need to iterate on this function based on the patterns and insights you discover in your boxing match data.
