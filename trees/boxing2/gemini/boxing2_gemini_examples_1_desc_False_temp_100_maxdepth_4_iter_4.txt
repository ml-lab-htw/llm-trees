**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Node Initialization:**  The `nodes` list is initialized with `15 * [None]` to accommodate up to 15 inner nodes, as specified in the prompt.

2. **Decision Tree Structure (Example):** The code now demonstrates a decision tree structure using the provided features (Judge, Official, Round) and branching logic.  **This is just an example; you'll need to determine the actual logic based on your understanding of the data and desired decision boundaries.**  Consider factors like which judge tends to favor which fighter, how scoring might change in later rounds, etc.

3. **Nested `if/else`:** The nested `if/else` structure reflects the decision tree's branching.  Each level of nesting represents a decision node.

4. **Return Value:** The function returns both the `prediction` (0 or 1, representing the predicted winner) and the `nodes` list. This allows you to see the truth values of each inner node and understand the path taken through the tree for a given input.

5. **Adaptability:** This framework is adaptable.  You can easily change the conditions in the `if` statements to create a more sophisticated decision tree based on the expected relationships between the features and the target variable.


**How to Customize the Decision Tree:**

The most important step is defining the actual logic within the `if` statements.  To do this effectively, you'll likely need some domain knowledge or assumptions about how the features influence the round winner:

* **Judge Bias:**  Does a particular judge tend to favor Trinidad or de la Hoya?
* **Round Significance:** Do later rounds have more weight, or are early rounds more indicative of the overall outcome?
* **Official vs. Unofficial:**  Is there a difference in scoring patterns between official and unofficial judges?


By incorporating these insights, you can create a decision tree that more accurately reflects the real-world scenario. For example:

```python
nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Judge G. Hamada (might favor Trinidad, hypothetically)
nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 8  # Later rounds
# ... etc. 
```

Replace the example conditions with your own, carefully designed logic to build a functional and meaningful decision tree.  Remember, this approach constructs the tree without training on data; it's based solely on your specified criteria.
