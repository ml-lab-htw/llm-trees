This function creates a decision tree based on the provided features. It doesn't use any training data; it's a handcrafted structure meant to illustrate the desired format.  The logic within the tree is entirely arbitrary, based on plausible but not necessarily accurate assumptions about how judges might score a boxing match. The goal is to create a function with the specified structure and using the Features. You can adapt the conditions and predicted values within the tree to match any specific logic you want to implement.  Remember, this is a synthetic example â€“  for real-world predictions, you would want to train a decision tree on actual data.
