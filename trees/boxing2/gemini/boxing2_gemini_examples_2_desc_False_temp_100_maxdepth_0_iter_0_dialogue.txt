    # Thresholds are placeholders. 
    # It's crucial to replace these with values determined from actual fight data analysis.
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6  # Early rounds favor fighter A?
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [0, 2, 5]  # These judges tend to favor fighter B?

    else:

        else:

```

**Explanation:**

* **nodes:** This list stores the truth values (0 or 1) for each decision node in the tree. 
* **Thresholds:** The placeholders (e.g., `Round <= 6`) represent decision points in the tree.  **You MUST replace these with meaningful values based on the analysis of actual Trinidad vs. De La Hoya fight data.** 
    * For example, if you find that De La Hoya tends to win rounds judged by "G. Hamada", "J. Roth", and "Los Angeles Times-Kawakami", you'd set `nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [0, 2, 5]`.
* **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` structure mirrors the decision tree's branches, leading to a final prediction of either 0 (Trinidad) or 1 (De La Hoya).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data-Driven Decisions:** The provided code is a template.  The effectiveness of this decision tree depends entirely on using real fight data to determine appropriate thresholds and decision rules.
* **Model Limitations:**  This simplified decision tree won't capture the full complexity of a boxing match. For a more robust prediction, consider the advanced features and models discussed in my previous response.
