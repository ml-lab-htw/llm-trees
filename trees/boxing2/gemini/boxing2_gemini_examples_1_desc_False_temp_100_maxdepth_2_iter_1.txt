**Explanation of Feature Selection and Tree Structure:**

Since I'm instructed to generate the tree *without training*, I use heuristics based on the feature descriptions to create a plausible (but not necessarily accurate) decision tree.  I'm aiming for a maximum depth of 2.

1. **Root Node (Level 0):** I chose "Judge" as the root node.  The rationale is that different judges might have different scoring tendencies, which could influence the round outcome. I split the judges into two groups based on their index (<= 5 and > 5). This is an arbitrary split without real-world data, but serves the purpose of demonstration.


2. **Level 1 Nodes:** For the left branch (Judge <= 5), I chose "Round" as the splitting feature. The idea is that the round number might indicate which fighter is performing better at different stages of the match.  I split the rounds at round 6 (first half vs. second half of the match). Again, this is a simplified split for illustrative purposes.

3. **Leaf Nodes (Level 2):**  The predictions at the leaf nodes (0 or 1) are assigned based on hypothetical assumptions about how the chosen judges and round numbers might relate to the fighters' performance.  For example, I assume Trinidad might be favored by some judges (Judge <=5) in earlier rounds, while de la Hoya might be favored in later rounds or by different judges.

**Important:** This decision tree is *not* trained on real data.  The feature choices, splits, and predictions are illustrative.  A real decision tree would require training on a dataset of boxing match rounds to learn meaningful patterns and make accurate predictions.
