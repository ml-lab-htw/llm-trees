def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list to hold truth values of inner nodes
    
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if Official Judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6      # Check if Round <= 6 (first half)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0    # Check if Judge is G. Hamada (example)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 3 # Early Rounds


    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # First half of fight
             if nodes[3]:
                 prediction = 1 # De La Hoya wins early rounds (Hypothetical)
             else:
                 prediction = 0 #Trinidad
        else: # Second half of fight
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad (Hypothetical)
    else: # Not Official Judge
        if nodes[2]: # G. Hamada (example)
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad (Hypothetical)
        else:
            prediction = 1 #De la hoya

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Node List:**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean (True/False) result of each condition in the tree. This lets you inspect the decision path.
* **Hypothetical Thresholds:**  The round thresholds (<= 6, <= 3) and the judge selection (G. Hamada) are illustrative.  You'll need real data to determine what splits are actually predictive.
* **Official Judge Priority:** The tree prioritizes "Official" judge status as the first split, assuming these judges are more reliable.
* **Round-Based Logic:** Within the official judges' branch, the tree then splits based on the round, hypothesizing different win patterns in the first and second halves of the fight.
* **Judge-Specific Logic:**  For non-official judges, the example uses a specific judge (G. Hamada).  A real-world model might consider patterns across multiple non-official judges.

**To make this a truly useful model:**

1. **Replace Placeholder Logic:**  Get real data on round outcomes and train a decision tree algorithm (or another classifier) on it. This will determine the best splits and judge combinations.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Consider adding more informative features if available, like punch stats, knockdowns, etc. This will significantly improve predictive power.
3. **Evaluate Performance:** Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's effectiveness.


This improved function provides a starting point for a more realistic prediction model, ready to be refined with real-world data and training.
