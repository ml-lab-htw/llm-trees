It's impossible to create a truly meaningful decision tree and set accurate thresholds for your boxing scenario with only the features 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'. 

Here's why:

* **Lack of Predictive Power:**  These features don't directly relate to who wins a round.  Knowing the judge's name, if they're "official", and the round number doesn't inherently favor Trinidad or De La Hoya. 
* **Arbitrary Thresholds:** Without actual fight data (scores, punch stats, etc.), any thresholds we set would be arbitrary guesses.

**Illustrative Example (NOT ACCURATE):**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 5]  # Hypothetical: These judges favor De La Hoya
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 and X["Round"] > 8  # Arbitrary: Official judges matter more in later rounds?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 4  # Early rounds might favor one fighter, but we don't know which 

    if nodes[0]: 
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    elif nodes[2]:
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya (arbitrary)
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad (default)

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**To make this meaningful:**

1. **Obtain Relevant Data:** Get round-by-round data that actually influences outcomes, like:
   * Judge Scores for each fighter
   * Punch Stats (total, jabs, power punches)
   * Knockdowns
   * Clinches, Fouls (if available) 

2. **Train a Decision Tree Model:**  Use a library like scikit-learn: 
   *  Feed it the data, letting it learn the relationships between features and round wins.
   *  The model will automatically create a decision tree with meaningful splits and thresholds. 

Once you have that data and a trained model, I can help you generate the Python function that represents the learned decision tree.
