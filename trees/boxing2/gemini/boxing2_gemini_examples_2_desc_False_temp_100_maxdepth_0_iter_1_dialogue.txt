def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 4 
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Assuming 0 represents "G. Hamada"
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Assuming 1 represents "Yes" for Official Judge

    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 4
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is G. Hamada
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad likely wins
        else:  # Judge is not G. Hamada
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya likely wins 
    else:  # Round > 4
        if nodes[2]:  # Official Judge
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya slightly favored 
        else:  # Not Official Judge
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad slightly favored

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

* **nodes:** A list to store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of each decision node's condition. This helps visualize the path taken through the tree.
* **Decision Nodes (Conditions):**
    * `nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 4`:  Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 4.
    * `nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0`: Checks if the judge is G. Hamada (assuming encoding 0 for him).
    * `nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1`: Checks if the judge is an official judge. 
* **Prediction:**  Based on the combination of conditions met, a prediction is made (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya). I've incorporated some hypothetical decision logic based on the limited information provided. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Encoding:**  Make sure the numerical encoding for judges (0-10) and official status (0/1) matches your dataset.
* **Data-Driven Rules:** The current rules are simplified and somewhat arbitrary. With a real dataset, you would use a decision tree algorithm to learn more complex and data-driven decision boundaries.
* **Thresholds:**  For numerical features (like Round), the choice of threshold (e.g., 4) would be determined by the decision tree algorithm based on the data.

This Python function provides the structure and logic of a decision tree classifier. To make it truly effective for your boxing prediction task, you'll need to train it on a relevant dataset with judge scores and round outcomes.
