```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely Trinidad in early rounds with these judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Possibly de la Hoya in later rounds with these judges
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Likely de la Hoya with other judges

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Reasoning for Feature and Threshold Selection:**

This decision tree uses "Judge" and "Round" as the splitting features.  Here's the rationale:

* **Judge:**  The prompt mentions several judges. It's plausible that some judges might have a bias (conscious or unconscious) towards one fighter or the other.  Therefore, grouping judges could be a useful predictive feature.  The split at 5 is arbitrary, but it creates two groups of judges.  You could adjust this split point based on domain knowledge (if you knew which judges were more likely to favor which fighter).

* **Round:**  The round number is another potentially important feature.  One fighter might be stronger in earlier rounds, while the other might be better at finishing strong. The split at round 6 divides the fight into the first half and the second half.

* **Target Prediction Logic:** The prediction logic within the tree reflects the assumption that some judges might favor Trinidad, particularly in earlier rounds. Other judges or later rounds might favor de la Hoya. These are just reasonable guesses in the absence of real data.


**Important Note:**  Because no training data was provided, this decision tree is purely hypothetical. Its accuracy on real boxing data would be unknown. To create a useful decision tree, you would need a dataset of past fight rounds, including the judge, the round number, and the actual winner of each round.  You would then use a decision tree learning algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) to train the tree on this data.
