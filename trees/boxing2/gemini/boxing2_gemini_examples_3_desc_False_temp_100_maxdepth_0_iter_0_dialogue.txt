I can't use the Iris dataset examples you provided because they are not relevant to predicting boxing match outcomes. I need data about the judges' scores for each round to build a meaningful decision tree for your specific problem. 

However, I understand the format you want for the Python function. Here's a template based on your requirements, along with placeholder rules. You'll need to replace these placeholders with rules based on actual patterns you find in your boxing data:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None] 

    # Example Rules - REPLACE THESE with insights from YOUR boxing data
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6  # Early rounds favor fighter X?
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1 # Official judges agree more often?
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [0, 2, 5]  # Specific judges biased?
    nodes[3] = X['Round'] >= 10  # Late rounds favor comebacks?

    # Prediction logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad likely wins early official rounds
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins if certain judges agree
            else:
                prediction = 0 
    else:  # Later rounds
        if nodes[3] and not nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya comeback in late, unofficial rounds?
        else:
            prediction = 0  

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` List:** Stores True/False for each node's condition.
2. **Placeholder Rules:**  You MUST replace these with meaningful rules derived from your boxing dataset.  Consider:
    * Which rounds each fighter tends to win more.
    * If official judges are more consistent.
    * If some judges lean towards one fighter.
3. **Prediction Logic:** This is a basic example. You'll likely need more complex logic with more nodes to capture the nuances of boxing judging.

**To make this function work:**

1. **Provide me with the boxing judges' scores dataset.**
2. **Analyze that data to find patterns and relationships.**
3. **Replace the placeholder rules with your findings.**

Once you have those rules, I can help you refine the decision tree and the Python function!
