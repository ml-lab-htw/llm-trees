```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 0
    else:
      prediction = 1
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the generated decision tree:**

Since we're building a decision tree of maximum depth 1 with no training data, the approach is heuristic.  We need to select a single feature and a splitting point for that feature.  

A reasonable heuristic for a binary classification problem without prior knowledge of the data distribution is to pick a numerical feature and split it at its midpoint.  In the Features, "Round" is the only numerical feature. It ranges from 1 to 12, so a sensible splitting point is the midpoint: (1 + 12) / 2 = 6.5.

The generated code then checks if the "Round" is less than or equal to 6.5. If it is, it predicts 0 (Trinidad wins). Otherwise, it predicts 1 (de la Hoya wins).  This is a very simple decision tree, but it's the best we can do with the given constraints and no training data.  With actual training data, a more informed and accurate decision tree could be learned.
