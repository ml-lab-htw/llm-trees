**Explanation of the generated decision tree:**

The decision tree is structured with a maximum depth of 3, as requested.  Since we don't have real data to train on, the splits are made heuristically.  I've prioritized the features based on the order they appear in your "Features" description, assuming that order reflects some prior knowledge or importance:

1. **Node 0:** Splits on "Judge" <= 4. This divides the judges roughly into two groups.
2. **Node 1:** Splits on "Round" <= 6. This divides the rounds into early and late rounds.
3. **Node 2:** Splits on "Official" == 1.  This distinguishes between official and unofficial judges.


The predictions (0 or 1) at the leaf nodes are assigned arbitrarily.  Without training data, we cannot determine which outcome is more likely given a specific path in the tree.  The important part is the structure of the tree and the conditions used for splitting.



**Important Note:**  This decision tree is NOT trained.  It is a template based on the provided features and constraints.  To make accurate predictions, you would need to train a decision tree model on real boxing data using a library like scikit-learn.  This code only demonstrates how to generate a Python function representing a decision tree's structure, not how to build a truly predictive model.
