**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The `judge_mapping` dictionary handles the categorical "Judge" feature directly within the function. The `.get()` method allows for a default value (-1) if an unknown judge name is encountered, making the function more robust.
* **Thresholds:** Reasonable thresholds are used for `Round` (4) based on a hypothetical early vs. late round split.  The judge selection (`judge_val in [0, 2]`) is arbitrary in the absence of data; with real data, the decision tree algorithm would determine the best splits.
* **Depth:** The tree structure adheres to the maximum depth of 3.
* **Truth Value List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of each decision node, as requested.
* **Clarity and Comments:** The code includes comments to explain the logic and the chosen thresholds.

This improved version provides a functional Python prediction function based on the provided feature descriptions and constraints, while also addressing potential issues with unknown judge names. Remember that the performance of this tree would be highly dependent on real-world data.
