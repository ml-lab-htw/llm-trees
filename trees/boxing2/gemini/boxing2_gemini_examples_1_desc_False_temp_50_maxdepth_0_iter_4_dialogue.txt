```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 8


    if nodes[0]:  # If Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # Round <= 4
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya (based on hypothetical data)
        elif nodes[2]: # Round <= 8
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad (based on hypothetical data)
        else: # Round > 8
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya (based on hypothetical data)
    else:  # Not an official judge
        # Less reliable prediction â€“ default to De La Hoya (could be improved with more data)
        prediction = 1 

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Official Judge Priority:** The tree prioritizes the `Official` feature.  This makes sense as official judges' scores determine the outcome.
* **Round-Based Splits:**  For official judges, the tree uses the `Round` to further refine the prediction.  The thresholds (4 and 8) are based on the hypothetical data provided earlier.  With real-world data, these thresholds would likely be different and could even be learned automatically during decision tree training.
* **Handling Non-Official Judges:**  For non-official judges, the tree currently defaults to predicting De La Hoya.  This is a placeholder.  With more data (e.g., majority votes among unofficial judges), this part of the tree could be made more accurate.
* **Data-Driven Thresholds:** In a real-world scenario, you would use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) to determine the optimal thresholds for the `Round` splits automatically based on the training data.  The values 4 and 8 are just for illustration.
* **Missing Data:** The current function doesn't handle missing data.  You might want to add checks and default values if a feature is missing.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_features = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

example_features = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")


```


This improved function provides a more structured decision-making process and a clearer representation of the decision logic as a list of boolean values. Remember that the accuracy of this tree depends heavily on the quality and quantity of the data used to determine the split points.  Using a machine learning library for training a decision tree on real-world data is highly recommended for better performance.
