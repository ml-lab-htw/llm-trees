def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge is a strong predictor
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Round might influence official judges

    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge...
        if nodes[1]:  # ...and it's an early round...
            prediction = 0  # ...predict Trinidad (hypothetical)
        else:       # ...and it's a later round...
            prediction = 1  # ...predict De La Hoya (hypothetical)
    else:       # If it's *not* an official judge...
        if nodes[1]: # Early round, slight edge to Trinidad
            prediction = 0
        else: # Late round, slight edge to De La Hoya
            prediction = 1 # ...predict De La Hoya (less certain)


    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (replace with your actual feature values)
example_features = {
    'Judge': 0,  # G. Hamada
    'Official': 1, # Yes
    'Round': 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output will be 0 or 1 (Trinidad or De La Hoya)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output will be truth values for the decision nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Feature Encoding:** The code now uses the specified feature encoding (0/1 for Official, 1-12 for Round, and 0-10 for Judge).

2. **Hypothetical Thresholds:** I've set a reasonable threshold for the `Round` feature (<= 6).  This is based on the idea that fights might shift momentum, but you'd need real data to determine the optimal split point.

3. **Handling Non-Official Judges:** The tree now includes a branch for non-official judges.  Since their influence is less direct, the prediction is less certain, but I've maintained a similar structure using the round as a secondary factor. The judge name is not used, given the depth-2 constraint.


**How to Use with Real Data:**

1. **Replace Placeholders:**  Once you have real data, analyze the relationship between judges, rounds, and the fight outcome.  You can use libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to determine the best thresholds for the `Round` feature (or potentially the `Judge` if you go beyond a depth of 2).

2. **Train a Real Model:**  For the best performance, use a decision tree library (e.g., `DecisionTreeClassifier` in `scikit-learn`).  This will automatically find the optimal tree structure and thresholds based on your data.  The provided function is a simplified illustration for a depth-2 tree.


This revised function is more accurate in its structure and provides a good starting point. With real data, you can refine it further and build a much more effective predictive model.
