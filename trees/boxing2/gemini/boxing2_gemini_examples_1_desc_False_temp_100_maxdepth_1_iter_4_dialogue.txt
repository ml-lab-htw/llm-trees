Since we don't have training data, we'll have to make an educated guess about which feature and split point to use for our single-level decision tree.  Let's hypothesize that "Official" judges are more likely to favor De La Hoya (target = 1).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judges (assuming 1=Yes)

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the following decision tree:

```
|--- Official = 1 (Yes)
||--- class: 1 (De La Hoya)
|--- Official = 0 (No)
||--- class: 0 (Trinidad)
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Data:**  This decision tree is entirely based on a hypothetical relationship between the "Official" judge status and the winner. Without actual data, we can't know if this is a good split or even the right feature to use.
* **Alternative Features:**  We could have chosen "Round" and a split point (e.g., `X["Round"] <= 6`) or even "Judge" and a specific judge's index, but "Official" seems like a more plausible starting point given the context.
* **Depth-1 Limitation:** A depth-1 tree is severely limited in its expressiveness.  With real data, a deeper tree (or a different model altogether) would likely be necessary for accurate predictions.


To get a useful decision tree, you *must* provide the actual round-by-round judging data.  Once you do, we can use a library like scikit-learn to train a proper decision tree (even with a depth restriction) and obtain a much more robust and accurate `predict` function.
