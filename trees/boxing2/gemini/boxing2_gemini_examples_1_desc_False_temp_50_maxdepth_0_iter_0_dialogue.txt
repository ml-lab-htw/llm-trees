**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder Thresholds:**  The thresholds used in the example (7, [2, 7], 10) are entirely placeholders.  You **must** replace these with values learned from a trained decision tree model. You need to train a decision tree classifier on your dataset (like the table example I provided earlier).  The training process will determine the optimal thresholds for each feature to maximize classification accuracy.

2. **Feature Encoding:**  The code assumes your categorical features ("Judge", "Official") are already numerically encoded as described. Ensure your data preprocessing correctly handles this encoding.

3. **Scikit-learn:**  I highly recommend using the `scikit-learn` library in Python to build your decision tree. It handles the training, threshold optimization, and prediction efficiently. You can then extract the tree structure and logic from the trained `DecisionTreeClassifier` object to create a custom function like this if you need to deploy it in a specific environment.



**Example using scikit-learn (highly recommended):**

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # For evaluating performance

# ... (Load and preprocess your data into X (features) and y (target)) ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Split data for testing

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)  # Create DecisionTreeClassifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Train the classifier

# Make predictions
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model (important!)
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# ... (You can then extract the tree structure from clf if needed) ...

```


Using `scikit-learn` provides a much more robust and accurate approach to building decision trees than trying to manually create the logic.  It handles all the complex details of training and optimization for you. Don't reinvent the wheel!
