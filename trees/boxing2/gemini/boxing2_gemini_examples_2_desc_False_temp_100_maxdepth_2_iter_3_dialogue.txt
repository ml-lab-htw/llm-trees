It's impossible to create a truly meaningful decision tree with only judge information to predict boxing round winners.  However, I can demonstrate the structure of the Python function you requested and make some hypothetical assumptions to illustrate the concept.

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on limited judge information.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features.
            - 'Judge' (int): Judge identifier (0-10).
            - 'Official' (int): 1 if official judge, 0 otherwise.
            - 'Round' (int): Round number (1-12).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            - prediction (int): Predicted winner (0 = Trinidad, 1 = De La Hoya)
            - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1 if condition met, 0 otherwise).
    """

    nodes = 2 * [None] 

    # Hypothetical split: Official judges are more likely to favor De La Hoya
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  

    # Hypothetical split:  Later rounds might favor Trinidad 
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] > 8 

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        if nodes[1]: # Late round
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad might have an edge
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya might be favored
    else:  # Unofficial judge
        prediction = 0  # Assuming a slight bias towards Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_data = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 10}
prediction, nodes = predict_round_winner(example_data)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict_round_winner` function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns the prediction and the `nodes` list.

2. **Hypothetical Splits:** 
   - We create two hypothetical splits for demonstration. In reality, these splits would need to be determined from actual fight data analysis, which is not possible with the current feature set.

3. **Nodes List:**  The `nodes` list stores boolean values (1 or 0) indicating whether the condition at each inner node is met for the given input.

**Important:** This example is highly simplified and likely inaccurate. To build a useful model, you would need:

- **Much more informative data:** Punches landed, knockdowns, ring control, etc.
- **Feature engineering:** Creating Features from raw data (e.g., punch accuracy).
- **Algorithm selection:** Exploring more powerful algorithms (SVMs, Random Forests, etc.)
- **Model training and evaluation:**  Using historical data to train and assess the model's performance.
