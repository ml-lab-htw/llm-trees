    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:

            'Official': Official judge (1=Yes, 0=No)

**Important Notes:**

* **Placeholders:**  The thresholds used in this function (e.g., Round <= 6) are placeholders. To build a truly effective decision tree, you *must* train it on real data.  The training process will determine the optimal splits and thresholds.
* **Data Encoding:**  The function assumes the data is encoded as specified in your prompt (e.g., Official Judge: 1=Yes, 0=No). Ensure your data matches this encoding.
* **Depth 2:** The provided structure adheres to the maximum depth of 2 requirement.
* **Node Values List:** The function returns a list where each element corresponds to an inner node.  1 indicates the node's condition is true, and 0 indicates it is false.  This helps understand the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.


To improve the tree, collect data on who won each round, including the judge, whether they were official, and the round number. Then use a decision tree learning algorithm (like `DecisionTreeClassifier` in scikit-learn) to train a model on your data. This will create a much more accurate and reliable classifier.
