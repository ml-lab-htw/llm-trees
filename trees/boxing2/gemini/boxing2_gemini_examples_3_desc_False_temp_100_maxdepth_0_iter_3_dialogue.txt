It's impossible to create a truly effective decision tree without actual data.  The examples you provided use features like "petal_length" which are irrelevant to the boxing match prediction. 

However, I can provide you with a basic decision tree function based on your boxing features. This tree will be highly simplified and likely inaccurate without real data to determine meaningful thresholds. 

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on judge scores.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features:
            - 'Judge': Judge (0-10)
            - 'Official': Official judge (1=Yes, 0=No)
            - 'Round': Round number (1-12)

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            - prediction (int): 0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya
            - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Example logic - needs real data to improve!
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] in [2, 5, 9]  # Judges likely favoring De La Hoya
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1  # Official judges have more weight
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] > 6        # Later rounds might favor a certain boxer

    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya likely wins if favored judge is official
        else:
            prediction = 0  # More uncertain, leaning towards Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya might be stronger in later rounds 
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad might be stronger in earlier rounds

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

* **nodes:** This list stores True/False for each decision the tree makes. 
* **Judge:** We're *assuming* judges 2, 5, and 9 might favor De La Hoya (needs data!).
* **Official:** Official judges' scores likely carry more weight.
* **Round:**  We're *guessing* De La Hoya might be stronger in later rounds.

**To make this tree useful:**

1. **Provide real round-by-round scoring data.** This is essential.
2. **Train a decision tree algorithm** on the data (using libraries like scikit-learn). 
3. **The algorithm will automatically:**
    * Find the best features (Judge, Official, Round, or others).
    * Determine optimal thresholds (e.g., Round > 8 instead of 6).
    * Create a more complex and accurate tree structure.

Remember that predicting fight outcomes is very hard! Even the best models will have limitations.
