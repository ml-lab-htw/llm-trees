```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4.5  # Splitting on Judge feature

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Predict Trinidad for lower judge IDs
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Predict de la Hoya for higher judge IDs

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation of the generated tree:**

Since we are constrained to a maximum depth of 1, the decision tree can only make one split based on a single feature.  I've chosen "Judge" as the splitting feature. The threshold of 4.5 is arbitrarily chosen as a midpoint among the available judge IDs. This simple split attempts to capture some potential pattern (though without training data, it's purely speculative).  Judges with IDs less than or equal to 4.5 are predicted to favor Trinidad (0), while those with higher IDs are predicted to favor De La Hoya (1).

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This decision tree is not trained on any data.  The feature selection and split point are chosen heuristically, not based on any learned patterns. Therefore, the predictive accuracy of this tree is likely to be very poor without actual training.
* **Feature Importance:** In a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined through training and evaluation of a model. Here, "Judge" is selected somewhat arbitrarily due to its numerical nature and potential for having some relationship with the target.
* **Arbitrary Split Point:**  The split point of 4.5 for the "Judge" feature is also arbitrary.  With actual training data, a more optimal split point could be found to maximize the separation of classes.
* **Depth Limitation:** The maximum depth of 1 severely restricts the tree's expressiveness.  More complex relationships between features and the target would require a deeper tree.

To improve this decision tree, you would need to provide training data so it can learn actual patterns and make more informed splits.  You could also experiment with different features or use algorithms to determine feature importance and optimal split points.
