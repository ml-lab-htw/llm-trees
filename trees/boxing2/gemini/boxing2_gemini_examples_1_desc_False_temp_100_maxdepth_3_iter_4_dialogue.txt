**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Hardcoded Thresholds:**  Because we're not training this tree on data, the thresholds (6 for the round, the specific judge selection) are examples.  You should replace these with domain expertise if possible. Perhaps certain judges tend to favor one fighter, or there's a known shift in momentum at a particular round.  Without data, these are best guesses.

2. **Feature Importance:**  The tree prioritizes "Official" as the root node, reflecting its likely importance.  The order and thresholds of the other features ("Round," "Judge") are speculative and should be refined if you have data or insights.

3. **Depth Limit:** The tree respects the maximum depth of 3.

4. **No Training Data:** This function creates a *fixed* decision tree structure.  It will not adapt or improve its predictions based on new information.  To build a truly effective model, you *must* provide training data (the round-by-round results).



This function provides a starting point and demonstrates the desired format.  However, its predictive power will be limited until it's trained on actual data. Remember, this is a demonstration; real-world boxing analysis is far more complex and nuanced.
