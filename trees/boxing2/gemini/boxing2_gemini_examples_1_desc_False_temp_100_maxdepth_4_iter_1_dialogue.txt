**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This decision tree is constructed *without* any training data.  It's purely based on hypothetical scenarios and the provided feature descriptions.  The actual relationships and thresholds would be very different with real-world fight data.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the numerical encodings you specified for the categorical features (Judge and Official).
* **Hypothetical Thresholds:**  The thresholds (e.g., `Round <= 6`, `Judge in [1, 3, 5]`) are entirely placeholder values.  With real data, a decision tree learning algorithm would determine the optimal splits.
* **Depth:** The tree effectively has a depth of 4, achieved through nested `if` statements.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the boolean (True/False) results of each decision made in the tree, which allows tracking the path taken for a given input.
* **Simplified Example:** The logic is simplified for demonstration purposes.  A real-world boxing prediction model would likely be much more complex and would consider factors like punches landed, knockdowns, etc.


To create a truly effective decision tree, you **must** provide training data.  The structure and logic will be significantly different when learned from actual fight data.
