I understand you want a Python function that represents a decision tree classifier for predicting the winner of a boxing round based on judges' scores. Since we don't have real data to train a tree, I'll create a plausible example tree. 

**Assumptions:**

* A simple majority of judges' scores determines the round winner.
* "Official Judges" have more weight in decision-making (this is just for demonstration and might not reflect real boxing rules).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on judge scores.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
            - 'Judge': Judge ID (0-10)
            - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - 'Round': Round number (1-12)

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) 
            - prediction (int): 0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya
            - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes
    """
    nodes = 4 * [None] 

    # Node 1: Is the round in the early stage (1-4)?
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 4 

    # Node 2: Is the judge 'official'?
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1 

    # Node 3: Is the judge among the more experienced ones? 
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2]  # Assuming judges 0, 1, 2 are senior

    # Node 4: Placeholder - Requires scores for Trinidad and De La Hoya
    # In reality, you'd compare the scores here
    nodes[3] = True  # Placeholder

    # Decision logic (simplified for demonstration)
    if nodes[0]:  # Early Round
        if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:  # Official and experienced judge
            prediction = 0 if nodes[3] else 1 # Predict based on score comparison
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Default to De La Hoya
    else:  # Later Round
        if nodes[1] or nodes[2]:  # Either official or experienced judge
            prediction = 0 if nodes[3] else 1 # Predict based on score comparison
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Default to Trinidad 

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage (replace with actual data)
example_features = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3} 
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

print(f"Prediction (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya): {prediction}")
print(f"Truth values of inner nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Feature Engineering:** You might need to engineer more features from the raw data, like the difference in scores between the fighters for each judge.
2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds in nodes (like `Round <= 4`) are chosen for illustration. You'd need a labeled dataset and a decision tree algorithm to learn the optimal thresholds.
3. **Score Comparison:**  Node 4 (`nodes[3]`) is a placeholder. In a real scenario, you would compare Trinidad's and De La Hoya's scores for that specific judge and round to determine the prediction. 

**Remember:** This is a simplified example. To create a more accurate and robust classifier, you'll need:

* **Labeled dataset:** With round-by-round judge scores and the actual winner of each round.
* **Decision Tree Algorithm:**  Use libraries like scikit-learn in Python to train a decision tree on your dataset, which will automatically learn the optimal tree structure, feature splits, and thresholds.
