        else:
            if nodes[2]: # Round <= 8
                prediction = 1 # Placeholder for draw - encoded as De La Hoya for simplicity
            else: # Round > 8
                prediction = 1 # De La Hoya

    return prediction, nodes

```


This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single round's features as input.  It returns the predicted winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya), and a list `nodes` containing the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember that this model is still simplified and based on assumptions. Using actual judge scores and a more sophisticated model would yield much better results.
