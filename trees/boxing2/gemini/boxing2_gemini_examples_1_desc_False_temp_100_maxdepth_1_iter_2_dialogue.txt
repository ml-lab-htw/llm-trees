```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree

    # Hypothetical: Let's say Judge 'Las Vegas Review-Journal' (index 8) strongly favors De La Hoya
    favored_judge_index = 8 
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == favored_judge_index


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Hypothetical Split:** As mentioned before, without actual scoring data, the choice of `favored_judge_index = 8` is completely arbitrary.  It's a placeholder demonstrating how the tree *would* work if we knew which judge consistently scored for a specific fighter.
* **Depth 1:** The tree has only one decision node (checking the Judge), fulfilling the depth-1 requirement.
* **No Training:**  The function does *not* learn from data. It uses a hardcoded assumption about the Las Vegas Review-Journal judge.
* **Encoding:** The function assumes the provided encoding for judges (0-10) and the target variable (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya).
* **`nodes` list:** The `nodes` list holds the truth value (True/False) of the decision node. This is useful for understanding the path taken through the tree.


To make this a truly useful decision tree, you *must* provide round-by-round scoring data so the algorithm can learn which features (and their values) are actually predictive of the round winner.  With more data, a more complex and accurate tree (or a different classification algorithm entirely) could be built.
