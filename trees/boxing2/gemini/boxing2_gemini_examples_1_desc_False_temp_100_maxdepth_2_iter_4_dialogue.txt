def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judges likely most important
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Hypothetical example: G. Hamada favors Trinidad

    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # and if it's G. Hamada (hypothetical)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:  # Other official judges
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins (hypothetical)
    else: # Not an official judge
         prediction = 1 # De La Hoya wins (hypothetical - unofficial judges don't decide outcome)

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1. **Hypothetical Tree:** This tree is still hypothetical.  I've made some assumptions about feature importance and potential biases. *You need actual data to create a meaningful tree.*

2. **Feature Encoding:** I used the encodings you provided. Make absolutely sure your input `X` to the `predict` function uses the same encoding (e.g., 0 for G. Hamada, 1 for B. Logist, etc.).

3. **Official Judge Dominance:** The tree prioritizes "Official" because these judges determine the fight's outcome.

4. **Second Level Split:** The second split (judge = G. Hamada) is a placeholder. With data, this split would be based on the judge who shows the most significant difference in their scoring for Trinidad vs. De La Hoya *among the official judges*.

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions at each inner node. This allows you to inspect the path taken through the tree.

6. **Limited Depth:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2, as required.

7. **Data Required:**  To reiterate, provide the round-by-round scoring data to build a tree based on actual patterns!  The example provided is a starting point to demonstrate the function structure.  A data-driven tree will likely be quite different.
