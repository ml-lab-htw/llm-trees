```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Since no data was provided, I'm creating a reasonable example tree.
    # Replace these rules with rules learned from your data.

    # Example 1: Official judges have more weight
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is it an official judge?

    # Example 2: Later rounds might favor De La Hoya (hypothetical)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6  # Is it round 7 or later?

    # Example 3:  J. Roth tends to favor Trinidad (hypothetical)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 2  # Is the judge J. Roth?


    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # Late Round
            if nodes[2]: # J. Roth
                prediction = 0 # Trinidad -  Official judge, late round, but J. Roth favors Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # De La Hoya - Official judge, late round, not J. Roth
        else: # Early Round
             prediction = 0 # Trinidad - Official judge, early round, likely Trinidad advantage
    else:  # Not Official Judge
        prediction = 1 # De La Hoya -  Not official, less weight, default to De La Hoya (this is just an example)


    return prediction, nodes



# Example Usage (replace with your actual feature values)

example_features = {
    "Judge": 2,  # J. Roth
    "Official": 1,  # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 8   # Round 8
}

prediction, node_values = predict(example_features)

print(f"Prediction (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Values (Truth values of conditions): {node_values}")

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1. **Placeholder Rules:** The decision tree rules I've implemented are placeholders.  You *must* replace these with rules learned from your actual data.  I've added comments to explain the logic of the example rules.

2. **Feature Encoding:** The code assumes your features are encoded as described in your prompt.  Make sure your actual data matches this encoding.

3. **Data Required:**  You *need* to provide data to create a meaningful decision tree.  The example I've created is purely for illustrative purposes and will not be accurate without being trained on real fight data.

4. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node. This helps you understand the path taken through the tree for a given prediction.

5. **Python Function Format:** The code adheres to the requested format, taking a dictionary of features as input and returning both the prediction and the `nodes` list.


**Next Steps:**

1. **Provide Data:**  Give me the data relating judges' scores, rounds, and round winners.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**  We might need to preprocess your data (e.g., handle missing values) before building a decision tree.
3. **Decision Tree Training:**  Once we have data, I can help you train a decision tree using libraries like scikit-learn. This will generate a much more accurate and complex tree than the example provided here.
4. **Tree Optimization:** We can then optimize the tree (e.g., pruning) to improve its performance on unseen data.



This revised response gives you a working Python function in the correct format, clarifies the importance of providing data, and outlines the next steps in the process.  Let me know when you have the data ready!
