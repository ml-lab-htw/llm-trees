```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Hypothetical split: Judges 0, 1, and 2 favor Trinidad (0)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]

    # Hypothetical split:  Official judges are more likely to favor De La Hoya (1) if not already decided by the first split.
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1


    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad (Default if not official and not one of the first three judges). 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Hard-coded Thresholds:** The provided judge indices and the official/unofficial split are based on the previous hypothetical assumptions.  These should be learned from real data.
* **Depth 2:** The tree respects the maximum depth of 2.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The function expects the features to be already encoded as integers, matching the provided mappings (e.g., Judge: 0-10, Official: 0 or 1, Round 1-12).
* **No Training:** As requested, the tree is built with assumed logic, not trained data.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the decision nodes, as required.
* **More Realistic Tree (with Data):** To create a genuinely useful tree, you *must* provide training data with round outcomes.  With data, a decision tree algorithm can learn the best splits and thresholds. The provided example is just a placeholder structure.  A real tree could use combinations of features and more nuanced thresholds based on the round number and judge characteristics.


Once you have real data, you can replace the hard-coded rules in the function with the logic learned by a `DecisionTreeClassifier` as demonstrated in the previous response.  The structure of the `predict` function can remain the same, but the internal logic will be data-driven.
