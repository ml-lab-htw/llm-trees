**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 3 * [None]`:  Creates a list with 3 elements (for a depth-2 tree) initialized to `None`. These will store the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node.

2. **Node Conditions:**
   - `nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1`: This is the root node condition. If the judge is an "Official" judge (value 1), the condition is True.
   - `nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 0 and X['Round'] > 6`: This condition checks if the judge is "G. Hamada" (value 0) AND the round is greater than 6. 
   - `nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 2 and X['Round'] <= 6`: This condition checks if the judge is "J. Roth" (value 2) AND the round is less than or equal to 6. 

3. **Prediction Logic:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements traverse the tree based on the truth values in the `nodes` list.
   - The `prediction` is set to either 0 (Trinidad) or 1 (De La Hoya) based on the path taken in the tree.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds used in the example (`Round > 6`, etc.) are hypothetical. You would need to analyze real boxing data to determine meaningful thresholds that reflect patterns in how judges score rounds.
* **Feature Engineering:** As mentioned before, creating Features (like score differences) can significantly improve the model's accuracy.
* **Data Limitations:**  A depth-2 tree might be too simplistic for this task.  You'll likely need a deeper tree or a more complex algorithm to capture the nuances of boxing judging. 

This code provides a basic framework for building a decision tree classifier for this problem. To make it more effective, you'll need to experiment with different features, thresholds, and possibly even the depth of the tree.
