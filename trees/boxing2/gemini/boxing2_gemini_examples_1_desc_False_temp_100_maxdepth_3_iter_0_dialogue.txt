def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes
    
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1 # Check if it's an official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Check if the round is in the first half
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 3   # Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman (using example index)


    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge branch
        if nodes[1]: # First half of the fight
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad
        else: # Second half of the fight
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya
    else:  # Unofficial Judge branch
        if nodes[2]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad (example assumption)
        else: # Other unofficial judges
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya (example assumption)
            

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Hardcoded Thresholds:** The thresholds (6 for `Round` and 3 for `Judge`) are examples.  Without real data, these are just guesses.  A trained decision tree would learn these thresholds from the data.
* **Official Judge Priority:** This tree prioritizes the `Official` judge.  If it's an official judge, the `Round` is used to make the decision. Otherwise, the `Judge` feature is considered (specifically, whether it's HBO-Lederman in this example).
* **Simplified Logic:** The provided structure enforces a maximum depth of 3.  The logic is simplified to illustrate the concept.  A real-world tree might have more complex branching.
* **No Data Dependence:**  The function doesn't depend on any training data.  It implements a fixed decision tree structure based on the provided features and the maximum depth constraint.

To make this a truly effective decision tree, you *must* train it on real data using a decision tree algorithm. Provide your dataset, and I can show you how to do that using scikit-learn.
