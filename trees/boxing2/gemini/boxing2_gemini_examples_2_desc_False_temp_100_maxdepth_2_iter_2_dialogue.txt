    """Predicts the winner of a boxing round between Trinidad and De La Hoya.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary with the following keys:

                       4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Los Angeles Times-Kawakami, 6 = USA Today,

            - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - 'Round': Round (1 to 12)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): The predicted winner of the round (0 = Trinidad, 1 = De La Hoya).
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Thresholds:** The thresholds (6 for 'Round', specific judges) are placeholders based on hypothetical judge tendencies. You'll need actual data and analysis to determine more accurate thresholds.
* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False) for each decision node in the tree. This helps understand which branches of the tree were taken to reach the prediction.
* **Depth 2:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2, meaning there are at most two decisions made before reaching a prediction.

**Remember:** This is a very simplified example. To build a more accurate model, you would need:

1. **Real Data:** Historical scoring data from Trinidad vs. De La Hoya fights.
2. **Data Analysis:** To identify actual judge biases and round-based patterns.
3. **Potentially More Complex Model:**  Consider increasing tree depth or using more sophisticated algorithms as data analysis dictates.
