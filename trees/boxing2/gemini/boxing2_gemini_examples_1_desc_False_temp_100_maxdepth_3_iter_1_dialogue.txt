**Explanation and Assumptions:**

* **No Training Data:** Since no training data was provided, the tree structure and thresholds are based on reasonable assumptions.  These are *guesses* about how the features might relate to the outcome.  With real data, these would be learned.
* **Official Judge:** I've assumed official judges are more likely to agree on a pattern (Trinidad early, De La Hoya late).
* **Non-Official Judges:** I've arbitrarily picked a few judge indices (0, 2, and 6) to represent potential biases towards one fighter. This would be determined by the data in a real scenario.
* **Round:** The round number is used as a splitting point for official judges, hypothesizing that earlier rounds might favor one fighter and later rounds the other.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node. This allows you to see the path taken through the tree for a given input.

**Important:** This function is a demonstration of the format and logic.  Its predictive accuracy is likely to be poor without real training data. The assumptions made need to be validated and adjusted based on actual fight data.
