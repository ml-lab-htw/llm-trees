**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Clearer Structure:** The code now directly mirrors the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand.

2. **Meaningful Thresholds:** The `Round <= 6` split represents a reasonable hypothesis that scoring trends might change between the first and second halves of a 12-round fight.  This is a placeholder and should be validated with real data.  In the non-official branch, Round is reused as a proxy, but ideally, this would be replaced with a more informative feature derived from the data, potentially a specific judge who tends to align with the overall unofficial sentiment.

3. **Data-Driven Refinement:**  I've emphasized placeholders for the predicted classes (0 or 1 at the leaf nodes).  To make accurate predictions, you *must* replace these with the actual outcome prevalent in your data for each branch. For instance, if the data shows that de la Hoya consistently wins later rounds according to official judges, you'd adjust the prediction accordingly.

4. **Handling Missing/Unknown Data:**  Real-world data often has missing values. You might want to add checks for None or use imputation techniques to handle missing "Judge" values in the non-official branch, as you don't use it.


This improved function provides a much more concrete starting point.  Remember to analyze your data, refine the thresholds and predicted classes, and potentially include more sophisticated handling of missing values to build a truly effective classifier.
