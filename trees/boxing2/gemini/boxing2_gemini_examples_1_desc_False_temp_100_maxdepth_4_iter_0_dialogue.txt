```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes (max depth 4)

    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 2  # If Judge is J. Roth (index 2)

    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # If round is <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
    else:
        nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # If it's an official judge
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya wins
        else:
            nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9  # If Round is <= 9
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad wins
            else:
                prediction = 1 # De La Hoya wins


    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding:** The provided encoding for the judges is used directly.  One-hot encoding might still be beneficial in a real-world scenario with a trained model.
* **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (e.g., Round <= 6, Round <=9) are illustrative.  With real data, a decision tree algorithm would determine these optimally.
* **Depth:** The tree respects the maximum depth of 4.
* **No Training:** As requested, the tree is constructed without training. Its performance would likely be poor without training on real data.
* **Interpretability:** The function returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes, making it easier to understand the decision path.



To improve this, you would need to:

1. **Provide training data:**  This is crucial for a realistic and accurate decision tree.
2. **Consider a machine learning library:** Scikit-learn (or similar) can build and train decision trees automatically, optimizing the thresholds and structure based on the data.  Manual construction is rarely optimal.
3. **Evaluate and refine:** After training, evaluate the tree's performance (accuracy, etc.) and adjust the maximum depth or other parameters as needed.



This improved approach would give you a much more reliable and effective classifier.
