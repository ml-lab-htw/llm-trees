```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1 
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6.5 
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  
        else:
            prediction = 1 
    else:
        prediction = 1 

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

* **Depth 1: Official Judge:** The tree first checks if the judge is an official ( `X['Official'] == 1`).  Official judges might be more likely to align with a particular fighter's win.  
* **Depth 2: Round  <= 6.5:** If the judge is official, the tree then considers the round number.  Earlier rounds (<= 6.5) might favor one fighter, while later rounds favor the other. This split point is a placeholder and would be determined more accurately with training data.
* **Predictions:**  The predictions (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) at the leaf nodes are placeholders.  These would be filled based on the majority class in the training data that falls into each leaf.

**Important Notes:**

* **Placeholders:**  The thresholds (e.g., Round <= 6.5) and the final predictions at the leaves are placeholders. To get a more accurate tree, you need to provide the actual data so the best splits and predictions can be learned. 
* **Feature Importance:** Without data, it's impossible to be certain which features are most important. The provided tree is a reasonable starting point based on the potential influence of official judges and the progression of the fight. 
* **Data Required:**  To build a truly effective decision tree, you'll need to provide the dataset with examples of rounds, judges, and who won each round.
