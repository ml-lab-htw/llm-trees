**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:** The `if/else` structure reflects a possible decision tree logic.
* **Meaningful Thresholds (Illustrative):** I've added example thresholds based on how one might imagine the judges scoring. **It's crucial to understand that these are completely made up for illustration!**  A real model would learn these thresholds from training data.
* **Feature Encoding Handling:** The code uses the specified feature encodings (0/1 for Official, 0-10 for Judge, 1-12 for Round).
* **Return Format:** The function returns the prediction (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values, as requested.

**Important Note:** This function is still an *illustration*.  The actual tree structure and thresholds would depend entirely on your training data. You would need to use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those in `scikit-learn`) to train a real model on your labeled data.  This code provides the *format* of the output and a basic example of how the features *might* be used.
