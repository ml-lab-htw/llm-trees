def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Reduced number of nodes based on the simplified tree

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is it an official judge?

    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4 # Early Rounds

    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 8 # Late Rounds

    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4] # HBO-Lederman or Sportsticker


    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Early Rounds
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya slight edge
        elif nodes[2]: # Late Rounds
            prediction = 0 # Trinidad slight edge
        else:  # Middle rounds
            prediction = 1 # Too close, default to one for consistency (could be random)

    else:  # Unofficial Judge
      if nodes[3]: # HBO or Sportsticker
        prediction = 0 # Trinidad Edge
      else: # Other unofficial judges
        prediction = 1 # Defaulting to De La Hoya for simplicity (really a 50/50 call)

    return prediction, nodes



```



**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Simplified Tree Structure:** The original hypothetical tree was complex and based on assumptions.  This simplified version uses fewer branches and makes some default decisions to produce a working function.
* **Clearer Conditions:** The conditions in the `if/elif/else` statements directly correspond to the branches in the simplified decision tree.
* **Feature Encoding Handling:** The code now correctly uses the provided feature encoding (e.g., 0/1 for "Official").
* **Default Predictions:**  In cases where the outcome is highly uncertain (e.g., middle rounds for official judges, most unofficial judges), the function makes a default prediction (De La Hoya in this case). This could be randomized or refined with more data.


**Further Enhancements (With More Data):**

* **Probabilistic Predictions:** Instead of hard predictions (0 or 1), the function could return probabilities of each fighter winning the round. This would better reflect the uncertainty inherent in boxing judging.
* **Learned Thresholds:** If we had round-by-round scoring data, we could train a real decision tree algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) to find the optimal thresholds for the "Round" feature and learn any judge-specific biases.
* **More Features:** Incorporating punch stats, knockdowns, etc., would significantly improve the model's predictive power.


This improved function provides a basic working example. However, remember that its accuracy is limited by the lack of real-world scoring data.  It serves primarily as a demonstration of how to structure a decision tree prediction function based on given features.
