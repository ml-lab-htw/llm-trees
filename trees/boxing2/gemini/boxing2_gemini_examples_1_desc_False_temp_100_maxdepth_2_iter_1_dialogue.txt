def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # G. Hamada

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1 # Official Judge == Yes

        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1 # Placeholder: In a real tree, we'd use majority vote of official judges here
        else:
            if X["Round"] <= 4:
                prediction = 1 # Placeholder: Too Close to Call or simplified rule
            else:
                prediction = 1 # Placeholder: Based on combined unofficial judges (simplified)

    return prediction, nodes


```


This Python function mirrors the simulated decision tree logic discussed earlier. Remember: this is a simplified example.  The placeholders indicated in the comments would need to be replaced with more sophisticated logic if you had access to real scoring data and were training an actual decision tree model.  The function returns both the prediction (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) and a list, `nodes`, representing the truth values of the decision nodes encountered during prediction. This allows you to trace the path taken through the tree for a given input.
