**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Placeholder Values Replaced:**  I've replaced placeholder thresholds with more realistic values based on the provided feature descriptions and some reasonable assumptions about boxing judging.  For example, I've added checks for specific judges potentially favoring one fighter over the other, and separated early, mid, and late rounds.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list now stores boolean values representing whether each node's condition is met. This provides a trace of the decision path.
* **Depth and Complexity:**  The tree structure uses the maximum allowed depth of 5 to make slightly more nuanced decisions.
* **No Training Data:** As requested, this function does *not* use any training data. It creates a fixed decision tree based on predefined criteria. This means it's not learning from data but applying a set of rules.



**Important Notes:**

* **Assumptions:**  The logic within the tree is based on reasonable assumptions, but without actual data, it's impossible to know how well these assumptions hold in reality.
* **Data-Driven Approach:**  To build a truly effective model, you would need a dataset of boxing match results with judge scores and train a decision tree (or another suitable model) on that data.  This hardcoded approach is very limited.
* **Refinement:**  The specific thresholds and branches in the tree can be further refined based on domain knowledge or analysis of actual boxing data.  For example, you could analyze how specific judges score in different rounds or against different opponents.



This improved function provides a more structured and interpretable decision tree within the given constraints, but remember that its accuracy is entirely dependent on the validity of the assumptions embedded within its logic.  A data-driven approach is highly recommended for real-world applications.
