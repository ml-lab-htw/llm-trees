```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for a depth-1 tree

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is official

    if nodes[0]:
        # Placeholder - In a real scenario, this would be the majority vote of official judges
        prediction = 1  # Assume De La Hoya wins if it's an official judge (needs data)
    else:
        #  Cannot reliably determine - default to Trinidad for demonstration
        prediction = 0  

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Single Node:**  A depth-1 tree has only one decision node, as reflected in the `nodes` list.

2. **Official Judge:**  We use the "Official" feature as the deciding factor, as discussed earlier. It checks if the value is 1 (Yes).

3. **Placeholders:**  The predictions within the branches are placeholders. You *must* provide data to train a real decision tree and replace these with meaningful predictions.  I've put in default predictions for demonstration, but they are not based on any analysis.

4. **No Thresholds:** For this specific scenario and the chosen "Official" feature, we use a direct equality check (== 1) rather than a threshold.  If we were using "Round" as the feature in a deeper tree, we might use thresholds like `X["Round"] <= 6`.

5. **Target Variable Mapping:** The function returns 0 for Trinidad and 1 for De La Hoya, adhering to your specified encoding.



To make this a useful decision tree, you need to provide the round-by-round judging data so the tree can learn the actual relationships between the features and the winner.  Once trained, the placeholders would be replaced by the learned patterns, and the tree could make more accurate predictions.
