**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Depth and Nodes:** The code now generates a decision tree with a depth of 4 and utilizes between 4 and 15 inner nodes. The example has 15. This structure provides more potential branching and decision points, fitting the requirements.
* **Feature Usage:** The code now uses the new provided features ("Judge", "Official", "Round") in the decision nodes.
* **Binary Conditions:** The conditions in the `if` statements are designed to be binary (True/False) by using comparison operators (<=, ==). This is crucial for decision tree logic.
* **Return Values:**  The function returns both the prediction and the list `nodes` representing the truth values (0 or 1) of each inner node's condition. This list makes the decision path transparent.
* **No Training:**  The decision tree is created without training, fulfilling the prompt's requirement to generate the structure without data.  The predictions are placeholder values (0 or 1) assigned to demonstrate the structure, as no training data is available to learn actual relationships.

This revised structure ensures that the decision tree: 1) uses the specified features; 2) has the appropriate depth and number of nodes; 3) makes binary decisions at each node; 4) returns both the prediction and the decision path; and 5) is constructed without any data training.  This is a valid, untrained decision tree structure as requested. You would need to provide training data and use a decision tree learning algorithm to determine the actual optimal split points and predictions if you want to have a functional model.
