```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge is primary split
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Round is secondary split (if official judge = yes)

    if nodes[0]: # Official judge is yes
        if nodes[1]: # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1 # De La Hoya (Hypothetical)
        else: # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad (Hypothetical)
    else: # Official judge is no
        prediction = 1  # De La Hoya (Hypothetical)

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Feature Encoding:**  The code assumes the encoding provided in the prompt (e.g., "Official": 1 for Yes, 0 for No). Make sure your input data `X` adheres to this encoding.
* **Hypothetical Predictions:** The class assignments (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) at the leaf nodes are still *hypothetical*. Without real data, we can only demonstrate the structure, not the actual learned predictions.
* **Thresholds:** The threshold for the "Round" feature (<= 6) is also a reasonable guess, assuming a potential shift in the fight's dynamic around the middle rounds.  This is a simplification.
* **No Training:**  This function represents a *pre-defined* decision tree, not one learned from data.  To build a true decision tree model, you need training data and a machine learning library.


This improved function provides both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes as requested, making it more informative for analysis. Remember to replace the hypothetical class assignments and thresholds with values learned from data when you have a real dataset.
