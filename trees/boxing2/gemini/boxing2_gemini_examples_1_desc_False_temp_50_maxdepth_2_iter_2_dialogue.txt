    "Official": 1,  # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Output: 0 (Trinidad)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: [True, True]

    "Official": 0,  # No, not official judge
    "Round": 8

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Encoding Alignment:**  The code now uses the provided encoding for judges (0-10), Official Judge (0/1), and Round (1-12).
* **Clearer Logic:** The conditional statements are more directly aligned with the decision tree structure.
* **Example Usage:**  The included examples demonstrate how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.
* **Arbitrary Choices Highlighted:** The comments emphasize that the split points (J. Roth, Round 6) and outcome assignments (Trinidad/De La Hoya) remain arbitrary due to the limitations of the features.


Remember, this decision tree's predictive power is likely very low because the features don't reflect fighter performance within a round. To improve its accuracy, features directly related to boxing performance (punches, defense, knockdowns, etc.) are necessary.
