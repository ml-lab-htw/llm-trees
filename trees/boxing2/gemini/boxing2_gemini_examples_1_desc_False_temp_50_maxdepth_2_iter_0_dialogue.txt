**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Feature Usage:** The code now explicitly uses the provided feature keys ('Judge', 'Official', 'Round').
* **Encoding Alignment:** The example usage aligns with the provided feature encoding (e.g., 1 for "Yes" in 'Official').
* **Meaningful Thresholds (as much as possible):** While still somewhat arbitrary without real data, I've used the provided example of Los Angeles Times-Kawakami as a potentially important official judge and a round split at round 6 for unofficial judges.  These are stand-ins for data-driven decisions.
* **Pythonic Structure:**  The code adheres to standard Python function definition and return conventions.


This improved version provides a functional decision tree, but remember that its accuracy and usefulness depend entirely on the validity of the initial assumptions about feature importance and the placeholder values used in the absence of real data.  A proper evaluation and refinement would require training on actual boxing match data.
