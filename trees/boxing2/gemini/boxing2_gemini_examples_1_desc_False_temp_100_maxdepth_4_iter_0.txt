This function simulates a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 and between 4 and 15 inner nodes using the provided features. It doesn't require training data and returns a prediction (0 or 1) based on the input features. The `nodes` list indicates which branches were taken.


**Important Notes:**

* This generated tree is **not** trained on any data.  It's a purely structural example following the requested format and depth constraints. The conditions within the `if` statements are arbitrarily chosen to illustrate how a decision tree *could* be structured using the provided features. 
* The actual performance of such a randomly generated tree on real boxing data would likely be very poor. A real decision tree needs to be trained on a dataset to learn meaningful patterns.
* The specific split points (e.g., `Judge <= 4`, `Round <= 6`) are completely arbitrary.  A true decision tree learning algorithm would determine these splits based on the training data to maximize predictive accuracy.
* The number of nodes used is between 4 and 15 to fulfill the requirement, and conditions are chosen to ensure every path reaches a prediction within the maximum depth of 4.
