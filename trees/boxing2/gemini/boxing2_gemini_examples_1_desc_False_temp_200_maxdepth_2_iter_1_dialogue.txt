    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6    # Round <= 6?

    if nodes[0]:  # If official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # And round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Predict Trinidad
        else:           # And round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Predict De La Hoya
    else:           # If not official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # And round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Predict Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The provided feature encoding is incorporated directly into the function.

2. **Thresholds:** I've used a round threshold of 6, splitting the fight into the first and second halves. This is a reasonable starting point, but a better threshold could be determined with actual data.  It's possible that a different round cutoff would be more predictive, or even that rounds aren't as crucial as we're assuming.

3. **Official Judge Importance:**  The current tree gives equal weight to official and unofficial judges. With data, we could see if official judges are more aligned with the final decision, and perhaps create branches that prioritize their scores.

4. **Judge Specific Branches:** The current tree doesn't consider the individual judges (G. Hamada, etc.).  If certain judges exhibit biases towards one fighter, incorporating "Judge" as a feature (and having sufficient depth in the tree) could improve accuracy.

**Example Usage:**

```python
example_fight = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_fight)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = De La Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

example_fight = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 0, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_fight)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (0 = Trinidad, 1 = De La Hoya)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**To reiterate, this decision tree is hypothetical.  Its accuracy and usefulness depend entirely on the quality and characteristics of the training data.**  Provide the data, and I can build a much more effective and data-driven decision tree.
