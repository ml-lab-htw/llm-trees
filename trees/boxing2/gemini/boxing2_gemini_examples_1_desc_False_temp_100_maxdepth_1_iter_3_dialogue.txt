```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth-1

    # We'll use G. Hamada (0) as the split point, arbitrarily.
    # In a real trained tree, this would be determined by the algorithm.
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  #  If judge is G. Hamada

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Predict Trinidad wins (arbitrary without training data)
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Predict De La Hoya wins

    return prediction, nodes
