**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Placeholder Logic:**  This function uses placeholder logic for the decision thresholds because we don't have real data.  For example, it assumes that G. Hamada might slightly favor Trinidad in early rounds. *You must replace these placeholders with reasonable values based on domain knowledge or data analysis once you have data.*
* **Feature Encoding:** The function assumes the encoding you provided for the features (0 for G. Hamada, 1 for B. Logist, etc., and 1 for "Yes" for the `Official` judge). Make sure your input data `X` follows this encoding.
* **Incomplete Tree:** The provided code only includes a few branches for demonstration.  You'll need to expand it to cover all judges and potentially add more levels/conditions based on the maximum depth of 5.
* **Data-Driven Approach:** This initial tree is purely hypothetical. The *real* structure and thresholds should be learned from data using a decision tree training algorithm (like the `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn`) once you have a labeled dataset of round winners and corresponding judge information.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the boolean results of the inner node conditions. This allows you to trace the path the function takes during prediction.  Make sure to expand the initialization of `nodes` if you add more levels to the tree.

Once you have data, you'll replace the hardcoded logic with the output of a trained `DecisionTreeClassifier`. The structure will likely be very different, and the predictions will be much more accurate.  This example provides a starting point for understanding how to structure the function and use the `nodes` list.
