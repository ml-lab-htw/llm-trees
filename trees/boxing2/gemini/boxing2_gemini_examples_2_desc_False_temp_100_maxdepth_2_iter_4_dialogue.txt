**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The `predict(X: dict)` function takes a dictionary `X` as input, representing a single round's features.

2. **Nodes Initialization:**
   - `nodes = 3 * [None]` creates a list called `nodes` with three elements, initially set to `None`. This list will store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each inner node of the decision tree.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
   - The `if` and `else` statements implement the decision tree's logic.  **You will need to replace the placeholder comments with actual decision rules based on your data analysis.**  Here's a possible structure:
     - **Node 0:** Checks if the judge is one of G. Hamada, B. Logist, or J. Roth.
     - **Node 1:** If Node 0 is True (it's one of those judges), check if they are an official judge.
     - **Node 2:** If Node 0 is False (it's not one of those judges), check if the round is within the first 6 rounds.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Based on the path taken through the decision tree (the truth values in the `nodes` list), a prediction (`0` for Trinidad or `1` for De La Hoya) is made.

5. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns both the `prediction` and the `nodes` list. 

**Important:**

- **Data-Driven Rules:** The provided code has hypothetical decision rules. You **must** replace them with rules based on the patterns you find in your boxing data. 
- **Thresholds:** You might need to introduce thresholds (e.g., `if X['Round'] <= some_value`) and determine the best values for your data.
- **Tree Depth:** The example demonstrates a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. You can adjust the depth and the logic as needed.
