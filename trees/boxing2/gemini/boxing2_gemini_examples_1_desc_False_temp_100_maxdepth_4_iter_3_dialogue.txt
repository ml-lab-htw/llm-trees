This Python function represents the hypothetical decision tree discussed previously.  It takes a dictionary `X` containing the features ("Judge," "Official," and "Round") and returns the predicted winner (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the decision nodes.



Remember, this is still a *hypothetical* tree. It's structured based on assumed feature importance, not real data.  To build a truly effective decision tree, you need to provide training data so the algorithm can learn the actual relationships between the judges' scores and the round outcomes.
