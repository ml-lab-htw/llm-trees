def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge = Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 7     # Round <= 7 (Hypothetical split)

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 7
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya (Hypothetical)
        else:  # Round > 7
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad (Hypothetical)
    else:  # Official Judge = No
        if X["Round"] <= 4:  # Round <= 4 (Hypothetical split)
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad (Hypothetical)
        else:  # Round > 4
            prediction = 1  # de la Hoya (Hypothetical)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:**  Uses the correct feature names "Official" and "Round" as specified.
* **Hypothetical Splits:** Maintains the hypothetical split points (7 and 4 for the "Round" feature) as we still don't have training data.
* **Target Encoding:**  Uses the correct target encoding (0 for Trinidad, 1 for De La Hoya).
* **Clarity and Readability:**  Improved code formatting and comments to make the logic clearer.
* **Node List:**  Populates the `nodes` list with the truth values (True/False) of the conditions at each inner node. This directly corresponds to the 1/0 requirement in the prompt.  The list is initialized with `None` values, and then the conditions are evaluated and assigned.



This function takes a dictionary `X` representing a single round's data and returns the predicted winner (0 or 1) and the `nodes` list indicating the path taken through the tree. Remember that the split points and predictions are hypothetical and would need to be learned from real data for a meaningful model.
