**Explanation and Reasoning for the generated tree:**

This decision tree is constructed based on hypothetical reasoning about a boxing match between Trinidad and de la Hoya, considering the provided features.  It *does not* learn from actual data, as requested. The logic is as follows:

1. **Judge Split:** The first split divides the judges into two groups based on their perceived leanings (completely hypothetical).  We imagine the first group (Judge <= 4) might slightly favor Trinidad, and the second group might slightly favor de la Hoya.  This is purely for demonstration and not based on any real information about these judges.

2. **Round Split:**  Boxing matches often have different dynamics in earlier vs. later rounds. We split based on Round <= 6 to capture this potential shift.  Early rounds might favor one boxer due to their initial strategy, while later rounds might favor the other due to stamina or adjustments.

3. **Official Judge:** The "Official" feature introduces another potential bias.  We hypothesize that official judges might be more conservative or stick to stricter scoring criteria, which could benefit one boxer over the other.

The predictions (0 for Trinidad, 1 for de la Hoya) at the leaf nodes are assigned based on combinations of these hypothetical biases. For example, early rounds with an official judge from the "pro-Trinidad" group are predicted to go to Trinidad.  Later rounds with an unofficial judge from the "pro-de la Hoya" group are predicted to go to de la Hoya.  And so on.

The important thing to remember is that this tree is a *demonstration* of how to structure the code.  The actual logic and predictions would need to be based on real data and analysis if you wanted a truly predictive model.



This revised response provides:

* A Python function `predict(X)` that takes a dictionary of features and returns a prediction (0 or 1) and a list of node truth values.
* The function implements a decision tree with a depth of 3, using the specified features.
* The decision logic is based on reasonable (though hypothetical) assumptions about the boxing match scenario.
* Clear explanations of the reasoning behind the tree structure and predictions.
*  Adherence to the requested maximum depth and use of only the given features.
