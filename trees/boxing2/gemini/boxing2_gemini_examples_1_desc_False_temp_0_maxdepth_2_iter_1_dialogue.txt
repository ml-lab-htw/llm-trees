    Returns:

The critical improvement in this code is that it now correctly stores and returns the `nodes` list, reflecting the truth values of the conditions at each split in the decision tree.  This makes it much more useful for analysis and understanding the decision-making process of the tree. The example usage also demonstrates how to interpret the prediction and the `nodes` list. Remember, the split conditions and outcomes are hypothetical without real data.  The "Judge" feature is not used directly in the splits. Its significance would emerge with a real dataset and a suitable encoding in a machine learning model.
