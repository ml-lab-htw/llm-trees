def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 1: Split based on Official judge status
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1

    # Node 2: Split based on Round, if Official judge is Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6 if nodes[0] else None

    # Node 3: Split based on Judge, if Official judge is Yes and Round <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2] if nodes[0] and nodes[1] else None  # Example: Hamada and Roth favor Trinidad

    # Node 4: Split based on Judge, if Official judge is Yes and Round > 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [1, 3] if nodes[0] and not nodes[1] else None # Example: Logist and Lederman favor De La Hoya


    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            if nodes[2]: # Judges 0 and 2 (Hamada/Roth)
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
            else:
                prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
        else: # Round > 6
            if nodes[3]: # Judges 1 and 3 (Logist/Lederman)
                prediction = 1 # De La Hoya
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Trinidad
    else: # Official Judge = No
        prediction = 0  # Default to Trinidad (could add more logic here based on other judges if data existed)

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **No Data, Hypothetical Splits:**  Since no training data was provided, the splits (e.g., Round <= 6, specific judges) are entirely hypothetical.  These *must* be determined from actual data to have any predictive power.
* **Depth 4:** The tree now has a depth of 4 (including the root).
* **Handling Missing Logic:** The `if nodes[0] and nodes[1] else None` structure ensures that the lower nodes are only evaluated if the branches leading to them are taken.
* **Default Prediction:**  When `Official` is No, a default prediction is made.  With real data, this part of the tree could be further developed.
* **Encoding:** The code assumes the judge encoding provided in your updated prompt.

**Key Takeaway:** This code fulfills your request for a Python function representing a four-level deep decision tree based on your specified features. However, it's crucial to understand that without actual data, this tree is meaningless for prediction. Its structure and splits are completely arbitrary.  The value is in demonstrating how such a function would be structured and how it processes the features to arrive at a prediction and a list of node truth values.  Provide training data, and we can build a *real* decision tree.
