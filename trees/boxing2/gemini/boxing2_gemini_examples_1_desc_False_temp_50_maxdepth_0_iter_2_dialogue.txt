**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Percentage Calculation (Crucial):** The provided code has a placeholder for `percentage_de_la_hoya`. You *must* replace this with a calculation that determines the percentage of judges who scored the round for De La Hoya.  You'll need to have access to the judge scores for each round to do this.  This is the *most important* part of making this function work.
* **Judge-Specific Logic:** I've added a bit of example logic where official judges 0, 1, and 2 are assumed to slightly favor De La Hoya, and others slightly favor Trinidad. This is just a placeholder. In reality, you might not want judge-specific rules unless you have strong evidence for bias.  The core logic should be based on the `percentage_de_la_hoya`.
* **Decision Tree Structure:** The current tree is very simple: one decision node based on the percentage.  You can make it more complex by adding more nodes based on official/unofficial agreement or round number (as described in my previous response), but start with the simplest version and add complexity only if necessary.
* **Data Structure for Judge Scores:**  Think carefully about how you'll store and access the judge scores for each round.  A dictionary or list of dictionaries might be suitable.  This will make calculating `percentage_de_la_hoya` efficient.


This revised version addresses your request for a Python function with the specified format, but its usefulness depends entirely on having the actual judge scores for each round and implementing the percentage calculation correctly.  Let me know if you have that data, and I can help you integrate it into the function.
