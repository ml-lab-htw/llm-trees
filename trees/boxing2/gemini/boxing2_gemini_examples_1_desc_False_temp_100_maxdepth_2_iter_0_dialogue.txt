```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge is Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Round is less than or equal to 6

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge is Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad
        else:       # Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
    else:       # Official Judge is No
        if X["Judge"] == 3: # Judge is HBO-Lederman (encoded as 3)
            prediction = 1  # De La Hoya
        else:       # Judge is not HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Trinidad

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The function assumes the encoding you provided for the features (especially the numerical representation of judges and the boolean representation of "Official"). Make absolutely sure your input data `X` uses the same encoding.
* **Hardcoded Tree:** This decision tree is *hardcoded* based on the hypothetical logic described earlier. It's *not* learned from data and will likely not generalize well.
* **Limited Features:**  The predictive power is constrained by the limited features.  More relevant features related to the fight itself (punches, knockdowns, etc.) are essential for a good model.
* **Example Usage:**

```python
example_round = {"Judge": 8, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}  # Example input
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)
print(f"Prediction (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")


example_round = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 11}  # Example input
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)
print(f"Prediction (0=Trinidad, 1=De La Hoya): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```


This revised answer directly provides the Python function in the requested format, clarifies feature encoding, and gives an example of how to use it.  Remember that building a truly effective model requires significantly more data and a proper training process.
