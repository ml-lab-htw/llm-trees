Explanation of Changes and Reasoning:

1. **Feature Selection:** The provided features "Judge," "Official," and "Round" were used. "Judge" is chosen as a primary splitting feature as different judges might have varying scoring tendencies or biases. "Round" is important as the fight's dynamics can shift throughout the match. "Official" is used to distinguish potentially more consistent judging.

2. **Depth and Nodes:** The code creates a tree with a potential depth of 4 (even though all branches might not reach that depth).  It initializes a list of 15 `None` values for the nodes to ensure we have enough potential nodes for a depth 4 tree, but the code is structured to ensure that only the necessary nodes are populated and used. At the end, it returns `nodes[:15]` to return only the nodes that were actually involved in the decision-making process.

3. **Splitting Logic:**  The splits are designed to illustrate how you might build a decision tree based on these features.  The specific conditions (e.g., `X["Round"] <= 6`) are examples.  In a real-world scenario, these splits would be learned from data using a decision tree training algorithm.

4. **Predictions:** The `prediction` values (0 or 1) are illustrative. A trained model would assign these based on the target variable distribution within each leaf node.


Important Note: This generated tree is NOT trained on data.  The splits and predictions are arbitrary examples.  To create a truly useful decision tree, you would need to train it on a dataset of boxing match data with the provided features and the "target" variable indicating the winner of each round.  Libraries like scikit-learn in Python provide tools for training decision trees.
