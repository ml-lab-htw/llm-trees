You're asking to create a decision tree function, but as discussed earlier, predicting boxing round winners based solely on judge names, official/unofficial status, and round number is highly unreliable. The outcome depends heavily on actions within the round which aren't captured in these features. 

However, to illustrate the format of the function you requested, here's a **simplified** example using the limited features and making some assumptions:

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round between Lewis (1) and Holyfield (0)
    using a simplified decision tree based on limited features.

    This model is for illustration purposes only and likely to be inaccurate.

    Args:
        X (dict): Features of the round:
            - 'Judge': Judge (0-9 encoding provided in your prompt).
            - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - 'Round': Round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            - prediction (int): Predicted winner (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
            - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1 if True, 0 if False)
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Example rule: If it's an official judge and a later round,
    # slightly favor Lewis due to assumed stamina advantage.
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] >= 8

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis slightly favored
        else:
            prediction = 0  # No strong prediction, default to Holyfield
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Unofficial judges less reliable, default to Holyfield 

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_round = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 10}
prediction, nodes = predict_round_winner(example_round)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict_round_winner(X)` function takes a dictionary of features as input.
2. **Simplified Rules:**  It uses two example rules: 
   - Is the judge "official"?
   - Is it a later round (assuming Round 8 or later)?
3. **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list tracks whether each rule condition was met (1 for True, 0 for False).
4. **Prediction:** The function makes a simplified prediction based on the rules and returns it along with the `nodes` list.

**Important Notes:**

* **Inaccurate Model:**  This model is highly likely to be inaccurate due to the lack of meaningful predictive features.
* **Real-world Application:** To create a more accurate model, you would need to collect data on punches, fighter activity, and other in-round factors, and use more sophisticated algorithms. 

This example aims to demonstrate the code structure and logic of a decision tree function, even though the underlying model is overly simplistic for the task.
