```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge = Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 3      # Round <= 3 (for Official Judges)
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 2      # Round <= 2 (for Non-Official Judges)



    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]: # Round <= 3
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:         # Round > 3
            prediction = 0.5 # Representing a "Draw" or uncertain outcome.  Adjust based on desired handling of ties. You could also assign it to either Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) depending on what makes more sense in your data interpretation for tie-breaker scenarios.
    else:        # Official Judge = No
        if nodes[2]: # Round <= 2
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield
        else:         # Round > 2
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in [nodes[0], nodes[1] if nodes[0] else nodes[2]]]

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Draw Handling:** The code now explicitly handles potential draws or uncertain outcomes when official judges disagree in later rounds.  It uses `0.5` to represent this, but you can adapt it to your specific needs (e.g., assign the win to one of the fighters based on some tie-breaker criteria).

2. **Truth Values List:** The returned list now contains only the relevant truth values for the traversed path in the tree.  For example, if `Official` is True, only `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]` are included; if `Official` is False, only `nodes[0]` and `nodes[2]` are included. The unused node's value will be set to `None`.

3. **Integer Conversion:**  The truth values are explicitly converted to integers (0 or 1) before being added to the list.

4. **Clearer Comments:**  The code is more clearly commented to explain the logic.

5. **Thresholds:** The thresholds (Round <= 3 and Round <= 2) are still somewhat arbitrary.  With real data, these values would be determined by a decision tree training algorithm to optimize classification accuracy.


This revised function provides a more complete and robust solution, addressing the requirements and improving clarity. Remember to adapt the draw handling and thresholds according to your specific data and interpretation of the boxing match rules.
