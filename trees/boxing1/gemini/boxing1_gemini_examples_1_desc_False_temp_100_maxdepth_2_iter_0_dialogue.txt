```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 4
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (Hypothetical)
        else:  # Round > 4
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (Hypothetical)
    else:  # Official Judge = No
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman (Hypothetical)
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (Hypothetical)
        else: # Other Judges (Hypothetical)
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (Hypothetical)

    return prediction, nodes

```


Key Changes and Explanations:

* **Feature Names:** Uses the exact feature names provided: "Judge," "Official," "Round."
* **Encoding:** Incorporates the specified encoding/mapping.  (e.g.,  `X["Official"] == 1` for Official Judge = Yes).
* **Target Variable Encoding:**  Uses 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield, as specified.
* **Hypothetical Logic:**  The decision logic remains hypothetical, as we still don't have real-world data to train a model.
* **List of Inner Nodes (nodes):** Creates the `nodes` list to store the truth values (1 or 0) of the conditions at each decision node. This list is returned alongside the prediction.


This function now matches the requested format and uses the specified encoding while maintaining the hypothetical decision logic based on the earlier example.  Remember that to create a meaningful, data-driven decision tree, you would need a real dataset of round-by-round scores.
