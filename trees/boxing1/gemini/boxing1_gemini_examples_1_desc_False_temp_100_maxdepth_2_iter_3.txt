**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The task is to create a decision tree classifier of maximum depth 2 *without training it on any data*. This means we have to make reasonable guesses about which features might be important and how they might influence the target variable.  Since we're dealing with boxing round judging, some plausible hypotheses could be:

1. **Judge Bias:** Different judges might have different tendencies to favor one fighter over the other. Therefore, "Judge" could be a useful feature for splitting.

2. **Round Dynamics:**  The dynamics of a boxing match can change throughout the rounds. A fighter might dominate early but tire later, or vice versa. Thus, "Round" could also be an important feature.


The provided decision tree function reflects these considerations.

* **First Split (Node 0):**  It splits the data based on the "Judge" feature, using a threshold of 4.  This effectively groups the first 5 judges (0-4) against the remaining judges (5-9).  This simulates a potential bias difference between groups of judges.

* **Second Split (Node 1):**  For each branch stemming from the "Judge" split, the data is further split based on the "Round" feature, using a threshold of 6.  This separates the early rounds (1-6) from the later rounds (7-12).  This reflects the idea that the outcome might change over the course of the match.

* **Predictions:** The `prediction` values assigned at the leaf nodes (0 or 1 representing Holyfield or Lewis winning) are just examples.  Since we're not training the tree, these are educated guesses.  In a real training scenario, these values would be determined by the training data.


**Important Note:**  Because this tree is constructed without training, its accuracy on real data would be highly uncertain.  This exercise is primarily about demonstrating the structure and logic of a simple decision tree classifier. To create a useful decision tree, you would need to train it using a labeled dataset of boxing match data, which would allow the algorithm to learn the actual relationships between the features and the target variable.
