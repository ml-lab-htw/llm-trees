```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Split based on Judge (first most important feature)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Split based on Round (second most important feature)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1 # Split based on Official (third most important feature)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:

                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

1. **Feature Importance (Assumed):**  Since we don't have actual data to train on, I'm making reasonable assumptions about feature importance.  A judge's decision likely has the most impact on who wins a round. The round number might influence the outcome (e.g., fighters might tire later). Whether a judge is "official" could also be a factor, though perhaps less so than the other two.

2. **Decision Tree Structure:** The generated tree has a depth of 3, as requested. It has 3 inner nodes (the conditions involving `Judge`, `Round`, and `Official`). The splits are made based on reasonable thresholds for these features:
   - `Judge <= 4`: Splits judges roughly into two groups.
   - `Round <= 6`: Divides the fight into the first half and the second half.
   - `Official == 1`: Checks if the judge is official.

3. **Predictions:**  The `prediction` values (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) at the leaf nodes are assigned somewhat arbitrarily.  Without training data, there's no way to know the true relationships. I've varied the predictions to demonstrate how different paths through the tree would lead to different outcomes.

4. **Python Function Format:**  The code is formatted as a Python function that takes a dictionary `X` of features (like you provided in your example) and returns the predicted winner (`prediction`) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values (0 or 1) of the conditions at each inner node.  This format allows you to see both the final prediction and the path taken through the decision tree.


**Important Note:**  Because this decision tree is *not* trained on any data, it's not making meaningful predictions.  It's just a demonstration of how a decision tree with these features could be structured.  To create an accurate decision tree, you would need to train it on a dataset of boxing rounds, judges' scores, and the actual round winners.
