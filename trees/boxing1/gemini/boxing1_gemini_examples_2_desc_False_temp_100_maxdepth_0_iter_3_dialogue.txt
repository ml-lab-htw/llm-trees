It's impossible to build a reliable decision tree and determine meaningful thresholds with only three features: 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'.  These features might not have a strong enough relationship with the outcome of a boxing round.

However, I can provide you with a sample decision tree function based on these features. Keep in mind this is a highly simplified example and unlikely to be accurate in predicting actual fight outcomes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
  """Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on limited features.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the features: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) 
    and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
  """

  nodes = 2 * [None]
  nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6  # Assuming Lewis gains advantage in later rounds
  nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 7]  # Assuming these judges favor Lewis slightly

  if nodes[0]:
    if nodes[1]:
      prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins 
  else:
    prediction = 0  # Holyfield more likely to win in earlier rounds

  return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage
example_features = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 8}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1: Lewis, 0: Holyfield)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Round:** The tree first checks if the round is greater than 6. This is a simple assumption that Lewis might have an advantage in later rounds due to stamina or strategy.
2. **Judge:** If the round is later, the tree considers the 'Judge'.  This assumes some judges might have a slight bias towards one fighter. In this example, judges with IDs 3, 4, and 7 are hypothesized to favor Lewis slightly. 

**Important:** This example is for illustrative purposes.  To create a more realistic decision tree, you'd need:

* **More Relevant Features:** Include features like punches landed, punch accuracy, defense, aggression, knockdowns, etc.
* **Data Collection:** Gather data from a large number of boxing matches.
* **Feature Engineering:** Explore and create Features that might be more predictive.
* **Model Training:** Use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) to train a decision tree model on your collected data.
* **Model Evaluation:**  Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.
