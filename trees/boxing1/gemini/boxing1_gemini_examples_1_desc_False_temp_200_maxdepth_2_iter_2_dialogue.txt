**Important Considerations:**

* **No Data:** The crucial point is that this decision tree is entirely made up because *you didn't provide any training data*.  It's just demonstrating the structure of the function.  To make a real decision tree, you need data showing which fighter actually won each round based on these features.
* **Depth 2 Limitation:** A depth of 2 severely restricts the complexity of the tree.  With more data, you'd likely want a deeper tree or a different model.
* **Feature Engineering:**  You might get better results by engineering Features. For example, a feature combining the judge and official status might be more informative than the two separate features.
* **Model Evaluation:**  Once you have a model trained on real data, you absolutely *must* evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and techniques like cross-validation.


Provide the training data, and I can help you build a more realistic and effective model.
