It's very difficult to create a meaningful decision tree with only three features (Judge, Official, Round) to predict the outcome of a boxing round. Judging in boxing is subjective and complex, relying heavily on nuanced interpretations of the fight. 

However, I can provide a sample decision tree function based on your requirements and a simplified assumption. Let's assume, for the sake of this example, that official judges have a slightly higher tendency to favor Lewis.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on simplified assumptions.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary containing the features:
      - 'Judge': Judge (0-9)
      - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
      - 'Round': Round (1-12)

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - prediction: Predicted winner (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
      - nodes: List of truth values for inner nodes
  """
  nodes = 2 * [None]

  # Simple assumption: Official judges slightly favor Lewis
  nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1 

  # Placeholder: Assuming later rounds might slightly favor Holyfield 
  nodes[1] = X['Round'] > 8

  if nodes[0]:
    # If official judge, slightly higher chance of Lewis winning
    prediction = 1 
  else:
    if nodes[1]:
      # If later round, slightly higher chance of Holyfield winning
      prediction = 0
    else:
      prediction = 1  # Default to Lewis

  return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

1. **nodes:**  Initializes a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions).
2. **nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1:**  This represents the first split in the tree. It checks if the judge is an official judge. We're assuming official judges might have a slight bias towards Lewis. 
3. **nodes[1] = X['Round'] > 8:** This is a placeholder condition, suggesting that in later rounds, Holyfield might have a slight advantage (e.g., Lewis might tire). This needs more data to validate.
4. **Prediction Logic:** The `if-else` block assigns the predicted winner (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) based on the truth values in `nodes`.

**Important Notes:**

* **Oversimplification:** This decision tree is highly simplified due to the limitations of the features. In reality, predicting a boxing round winner requires much more information (punch stats, ring control, aggression, etc.).
* **Data-Driven Improvement:**  To make this tree more meaningful, you would need a dataset of Lewis-Holyfield rounds with judge scores, and then use a decision tree algorithm to learn the best splits from the data. 

Remember, this example is meant to illustrate the structure of the function. For accurate predictions, you need a richer dataset and potentially more sophisticated modeling techniques.
