def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge = yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4     # Round <= 4

    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge path
        if nodes[1]:  # Early rounds
            prediction = 1 # Lewis
        else:       # Later rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:       # Not Official Judge
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman (index 3)
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:           # Other unofficial judges
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes

```


This function implements the decision tree logic described previously. It takes a dictionary `X` representing the features of a single round and returns the predicted winner (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list `nodes` indicating the truth values of the decision nodes.  Remember the caveats from the previous explanation: this is a simplified illustration, not a robust prediction model.
