```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Branch 1: Based on Official Judge status and Round
    nodes[0] = (X["Official"] == 1) and (X["Round"] <= 7)

    # Branch 2: Based on Round (for when Official judge is not a factor)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4  # Example threshold - Needs data to optimize


    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge is influential in earlier rounds
        prediction = 0 # Holyfield likely to win if Official Judge agrees, and the round is earlier
    elif nodes[1]: # Early rounds (round 4 or less), possibly even without official judge support
        prediction = 0 # Holyfield likely to win in very early rounds, as there are no official judges in play or they may not always make the right decision so early on.
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis likely to win in later rounds, or if Official Judge disagrees early on, or if the Official judge agrees and later rounds.

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Thresholds:**  The thresholds (7 for Round in the first branch, and 4 for Round in the second branch) are *examples*.  To find the *best* thresholds, you would need the fight data and train a decision tree using a library like scikit-learn.  The library will determine the optimal splits based on information gain or Gini impurity.

2. **Judge Feature:**  The provided "Judge" feature (0-9) isn't used in this simplified example.  To use it effectively, you need data on how each judge scored each round. Then you could create features representing each judge's tendency to favor Lewis or Holyfield.  This would require more complex feature engineering and a deeper tree.

3. **Data Encoding:** The provided judge encoding (0-9) and Official (0/1) are already suitable for the decision tree.


**Example Usage:**

```python
example_features = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}  # Example round
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth values of conditions): {nodes}")

example_features = {"Judge": 8, "Official": 0, "Round": 10} # Example round
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth values of conditions): {nodes}")

example_features = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 12} # Example round
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes (Truth values of conditions): {nodes}")


```


This example shows how to use the `predict` function and interpret the output.  Remember that without real data, the predictions and chosen thresholds are just for illustration. Using real data and training a decision tree classifier with scikit-learn will provide much more accurate and reliable results.
