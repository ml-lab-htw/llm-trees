```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Split based on Judge (somewhat arbitrary)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Split based on Round (somewhat arbitrary)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Example prediction
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Example prediction
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Example prediction

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

Since we don't have any actual data or training process, the splits in the decision tree are chosen somewhat arbitrarily to demonstrate the structure and desired format.  Here's the breakdown:

1. **Maximum Depth 2:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2, meaning two levels of decision nodes below the root.

2. **Feature Selection (Arbitrary):**  Because we aren't training on data, we have to select features for the splits arbitrarily.  I've chosen "Judge" for the first split and "Round" for the second split.  In a real-world scenario, feature importance would be determined during the training process (e.g., using information gain, Gini impurity, etc.).

3. **Thresholds (Arbitrary):**  The thresholds for the splits (e.g., `Judge <= 4`, `Round <= 6`) are also arbitrary.  In a trained decision tree, these thresholds would be learned from the data to maximize the separation of classes.

4. **Predictions (Arbitrary):**  The predictions (0 or 1) at the leaf nodes are also examples.  A trained model would assign predictions based on the majority class of the training examples that fall into each leaf.

5. **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 if the condition is met, 0 otherwise) for each decision node.  This allows you to track the path taken through the tree for a given input.

**How This Would Work With Training Data:**

If you had training data, you would use a decision tree algorithm (like those available in scikit-learn) to build the tree.  The algorithm would:

* **Determine the best features to split on:**  Using metrics like information gain or Gini impurity.
* **Find the optimal thresholds for each split:**  To maximize the separation of classes at each node.
* **Assign predictions to the leaf nodes:**  Based on the majority class of the training examples that reach each leaf.


This provided function is a structural template.  To make it a truly useful classifier, you would need to train it using a dataset and a decision tree learning algorithm.
