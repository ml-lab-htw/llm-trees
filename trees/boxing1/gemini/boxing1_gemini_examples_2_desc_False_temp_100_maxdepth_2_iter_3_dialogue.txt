**Explanation:**

1. **`predict(X)` function:** Takes a dictionary `X` containing the features for a single boxing round.
2. **`nodes = 3 * [None]`:** Creates a list `nodes` with 3 elements (for a depth-2 tree), initially set to `None`. Each element will store the truth value of a condition in the tree.
3. **Decision Logic:**
   - **`nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6`:** This is the first split condition. It checks if the round is less than or equal to 6 (assuming early rounds might favor a particular fighter). 
   - **`nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1`:** This condition checks if the score is from an official judge, potentially giving more weight to their decisions.
   - **`nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 5]`:**  This example assumes you might find patterns where specific judges tend to favor one fighter over the other. 
4. **`if` and `else` statements:** These statements traverse the decision tree based on the truth values stored in the `nodes` list. 
5. **`prediction = ...`:**  Assigns the predicted class (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) based on the path taken through the tree.
6. **`return prediction, nodes`:**  Returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.

**Important:**

* **Feature Engineering:** The example conditions in this code are very basic. You should perform thorough data exploration and analysis to engineer more meaningful features and define more effective split conditions for your decision tree. 
* **Threshold Selection:** The thresholds used in the example (e.g., `Round <= 6`) are arbitrary. You'll need to determine appropriate thresholds based on your data.

Remember that building a successful machine learning model requires careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
