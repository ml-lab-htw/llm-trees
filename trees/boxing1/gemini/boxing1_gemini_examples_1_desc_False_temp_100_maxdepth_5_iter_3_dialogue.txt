    # Branch 1: Based on Official Judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge

    # Branch 2: Round Number (split at round 6)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Branch 3:  Judge (split based on a few judges known for potentially favoring certain fighters - hypothetical!)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 8] # E. Williams, S. Christodoulu, ESPN (hypothetical bias towards Lewis)

    # Branch 4: Another round split (Later rounds might favor different fighters due to fatigue etc.)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Hypothetical Splits:** Because we don't have real data, the splits in this decision tree (e.g., which judges favor which fighter, the impact of round number) are entirely hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only.  With real fight data, these splits would be learned automatically by a decision tree algorithm and would likely be based on more relevant features (punches landed, knockdowns, etc.).
* **Feature Encoding:** The code assumes the encoding you provided for the features (Judge as numerical, Official as 1/0, Round as numerical).
* **Maximum Depth:** The tree respects the maximum depth of 5.
* **Truth Values (nodes list):** The `nodes` list stores the truth value (True/False, represented as 1/0 in Python) of each decision node as the function traverses the tree.  This lets you see which branches were taken for a given input.
* **Real-World Application:**  To build a useful decision tree for boxing, you **must** gather data that accurately reflects the factors that determine the winner of a round.  This example only uses the provided features and makes hypothetical assumptions due to the lack of real data.


This improved response provides a Python function that adheres to your specifications and provides a more in-depth explanation. Remember, the accuracy and usefulness of this function are entirely dependent on the quality and relevance of the data used to train a real decision tree model.
