def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list to hold node truth values

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Round <= 6?
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 8]  # Judges: E.Williams, S.Christodoulu, ESPN? (Illustrative)

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (Example - No data to truly determine this)
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (Example)
    else:  # Unofficial Judge
        if nodes[2]: # Specific Judges
            prediction = 1 # Lewis (Example)
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield (Example)


    return prediction, nodes

Explanation of the Choices (Since no training data was provided):

1. **Root Node (Official):**  I've chosen "Official" status as the root node. This is a reasonable starting point as official judges might have more weight than unofficial ones.

2. **Second Level (Round):**  For official judges, I split based on the round number. The assumption here is that the fight's dynamics might change as the rounds progress. I chose a split point of round 6 (halfway through a 12-round fight).

3. **Second Level (Judge):** For unofficial judges, I split based on the judge.  Since we have no data to know individual judge bias, this is just illustrative. I arbitrarily selected a few judges for the split.  In a real scenario, this would be determined by the data.

4. **Leaf Nodes (Predictions):** The predictions (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) are entirely placeholder examples.  With real data, the tree would learn the correct majority class for each leaf node.

Important:  This function creates a *hypothetical* decision tree based on reasonable assumptions in the absence of data.  To create a truly effective decision tree, you *must* provide training data.  The structure and predictions will likely be very different once trained on real-world examples.
