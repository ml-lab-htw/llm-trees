def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] <= 4.5 
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely Holyfield won early rounds based on limited judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Potentially Lewis did better in later rounds 
    else:
        prediction = 1      # Assuming judges beyond index 4 favored Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Assumptions:**

* **Data Limitations:** Without actual fight data, these thresholds are speculative. 
* **Judge Feature:** I'm assuming the ordering of judges (0-9) might reflect some implicit bias towards one fighter. This is a BIG assumption without more context. 
* **Round Feature:** A common trend in boxing is that early rounds might favor one fighter, while later rounds swing the other way.
* **Depth 2:** The decision tree prioritizes 'Judge' and then 'Round'. This implies that the specific judge might be more informative than the round number (in this hypothetical model).

**Important Notes:**

* This function needs to be validated and refined with real data.  
* Feature engineering (e.g., score differentials) is crucial for a robust model. 
* Consider exploring different decision tree depths and algorithms with sufficient data.
