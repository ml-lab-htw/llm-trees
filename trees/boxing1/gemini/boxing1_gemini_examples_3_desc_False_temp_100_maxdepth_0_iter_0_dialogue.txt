It's challenging to build a highly accurate decision tree for boxing round prediction based solely on the judge, official status, and round number. This is because the outcome depends heavily on the fighters' actions within the round, which aren't directly reflected in these features. 

However, we can create a simplified decision tree based on some potential trends:

**Assumptions:**

* **Official Judges:** We'll assume "Official Judge = Yes" might indicate slightly more weight in their decision, though this is not always the case in practice.
* **Later Rounds:** We'll assume fighters might be more fatigued in later rounds, potentially leading to less decisive scoring. 

**Simplified Decision Tree (Python Function):**

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on simplified assumptions.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
            - 'Judge': Judge (0-9) 
            - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - 'Round': Round number (1-12)

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            - prediction (int): Predicted winner (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
            - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1=True, 0=False)
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None] 

    # Node 1: Is the round in the later half of the fight?
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] > 6 

    # Node 2: Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1

    # Node 3: Is the judge known to favor aggressive styles? (Placeholder)
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [3, 8]  # Example: HBO-Lederman (3) and ESPN (8)

    if nodes[0]: 
        # Later Rounds:
        if nodes[1] and nodes[2]:
            # Official judge favoring aggressive style:  Slight edge to Lewis (known for aggression)
            prediction = 1  
        else:
            # Other judges or less aggressive styles: Slight edge to Holyfield (known for technique) 
            prediction = 0 
    else:
        # Earlier Rounds: Assume more decisive scores, leaning towards Lewis
        prediction = 1 

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example Usage:
example_features = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 10}
prediction, nodes = predict_round_winner(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```

**Important Notes:**

* **Placeholders:** The threshold values and judge selection in `nodes[2]` are placeholders. Realistically, identifying judges' biases requires analyzing their scoring patterns across multiple fights.
* **Oversimplification:** This tree is highly simplified. A more accurate model would need many more features related to the actual events within a round (punches landed, knockdowns, aggression, ring control, etc.).
* **Data Required:**  Building a more robust model requires a dataset with round-by-round scores from multiple judges, the declared round winner, and ideally, detailed fight statistics.
