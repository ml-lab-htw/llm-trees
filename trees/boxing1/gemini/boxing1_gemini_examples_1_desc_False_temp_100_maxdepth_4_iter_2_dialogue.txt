def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list to store node truth values

    # Decision tree logic based on provided features (without real training)
    # Note: Thresholds and logic are illustrative and not based on real fight data.

    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 4    # Is it in the early rounds?
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2] # Judges 0, 1, and 2 tend to favor Lewis early

    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Early Round
            if nodes[2]: # Specific Judges
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0 # Holyfield wins
        else: # Later Round
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield favored in later rounds (just an example)
    else: # Not Official Judge
        nodes[3] = X['Round'] >= 10
        if nodes[3]:  # Very Late Round
            prediction = 1  # Lewis gets a late surge (example logic)
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield more likely to win otherwise (example)


    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **No Real Training:** This decision tree is constructed with *placeholder logic*. The thresholds and conditions are examples, not derived from actual fight data.  It's crucial to understand this is *not* a reliable predictor without real training.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code assumes the features are encoded as described in your prompt (Judge: 0-9, Official: 0/1, Round: 1-12).
* **Depth 4:**  The tree effectively has a depth of 4 due to the nested `if` statements.
* **Illustrative Logic:** The conditions within the `if` statements are entirely for demonstration.  For example, the idea that certain judges favor Lewis early, or that Holyfield is favored in later rounds, is arbitrary and wouldn't hold up in reality without data to back it up.
* **`nodes` List:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, which become 1/0 when used in arithmetic operations) of the conditions at each inner node.  This provides a way to trace the path through the tree.

To make this a truly predictive model, you *must* train it on a dataset of real fight data with relevant statistics (punches, knockdowns, etc.), as explained in my previous response.  This example only fulfills the requirement of creating the Python function structure based on your specific input features and desired depth.
