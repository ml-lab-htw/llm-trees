def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values for each node

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4      # Round <= 4 (if official judge)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 3      # Judge is HBO-Lederman (if not official judge)

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # Early Round
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (Assumed to do better in early rounds with official judges)
        else:        # Later Round
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:          # Unofficial Judge
        if nodes[2]: # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (Assumed to be favored by Lederman)
        else:        # Other unofficial judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Hardcoded Thresholds:**  The thresholds (Round <= 4, Judge == 3) are based on the illustrative example and assumptions.  These are placeholders.  *With real data*, a decision tree algorithm would learn the optimal thresholds.
* **Feature Encoding:** The function assumes the features are already encoded as described in your prompt (e.g., Judge as an integer 0-9, Official as 1 or 0, Round as 1-12).
* **No Data, No Real Learning:** This function implements the *structure* of the example decision tree, but it does not learn from data.  Its predictive accuracy is unknown without training on a real dataset.
* **List `nodes`:** The `nodes` list stores the boolean (True/False) result of each decision in the tree.  This helps understand the path taken for each prediction.  The length of `nodes` corresponds to the number of internal nodes (decision points) in the tree.



To get a truly useful decision tree, please provide the dataset showing the round-by-round scoring from each judge and the winner of each round.  Then, I can train a model using scikit-learn and provide you with a more robust and data-driven `predict` function.
