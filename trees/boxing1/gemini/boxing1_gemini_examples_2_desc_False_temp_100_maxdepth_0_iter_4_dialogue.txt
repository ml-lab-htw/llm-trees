You're asking to create a decision tree classifier based on judge information to predict the winner of a boxing round, but as I mentioned before, this is not reliable without information about the fight dynamics. 

However, I can demonstrate how to structure a Python function to represent a decision tree, including returning the truth values of inner nodes, using your provided examples as a guide and incorporating the judge features.  

**Keep in mind this is for illustrative purposes only, and the resulting predictions won't be accurate for predicting fight outcomes.**

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on limited judge information.
    This is for illustration purposes ONLY and not accurate for real fight prediction.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features with keys:
            'Judge': (0-9), 
            'Official': (0 or 1), 
            'Round': (1-12) 

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) where:
            prediction (int): Predicted round winner (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
            nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the truth value
                          of each inner node condition. 
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None] 

    # Example decision nodes - These are arbitrary and not based on real fight logic
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [1, 3, 5] # Is the judge in a specific subset?
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] > 6  # Is it a later round in the fight?

    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # Judge from specific subset
            prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0 # Lewis wins later, Holyfield wins earlier
        else: 
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield wins
    else: # Unofficial Judge
        prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0 # Lewis wins later, Holyfield wins earlier

    return prediction, nodes

# Example Usage
example_features = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 9}
prediction, nodes = predict_round_winner(example_features)

print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Truth Values of Inner Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Structure:** The `predict_round_winner` function takes a dictionary of features as input and returns the predicted winner and a list of truth values for the decision nodes.
2. **Decision Nodes:** The `nodes` list stores boolean values (True/False) based on the conditions checked at each level of the decision tree. The example conditions are arbitrary.
3. **Decision Tree Logic:** The `if/else` statements implement the decision tree logic. 
4. **Example Usage:** The code shows how to call the function with sample data and interpret the output.

**To create a meaningful decision tree, you would replace the example conditions with rules based on actual fight dynamics and potentially use a machine learning algorithm to learn these rules from data.**
