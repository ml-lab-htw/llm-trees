def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge is "Yes"
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 4
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Round > 4
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Not an official judge
        nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[2]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1 # Lewis
        else:  # Other judge
            nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[3]: # Round <= 6
                prediction = 0.5 # Representing a "Draw" (could also return a separate string "Draw")
            else: # Round > 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:** The code now uses the correct feature names "Judge," "Official," and "Round" with the specified encoding.
* **Target Encoding:** The `prediction` now returns 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield, as requested.
* **Thresholds:** I've filled in placeholder thresholds with reasonable values based on the previous assumptions (e.g., Round <= 4 for official judges favoring Lewis early).
* **Draw Handling:**  I've used 0.5 to represent a "Draw" outcome.  This is a simplified approach; you could return a separate string "Draw" or a three-class classification (Lewis, Holyfield, Draw) if needed.  Another option would be to assign the prediction randomly to Lewis or Holyfield if the example ends up at this leaf node.
* **Node List:** The `nodes` list is now populated with the truth values (True/False) of each inner node's condition, which corresponds to 1/0 as requested. The list size is initialized to 4 as there are at most 4 comparison nodes depending on the path through the tree.  Unused elements remain `None`.


**Important Note:** This function implements the *structure* of the decision tree we discussed.  However, the accuracy of its predictions depends entirely on the validity of the assumptions we made about how judges score and the fight dynamics.  With real-world data, you would train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` (as shown in the previous example) to determine the optimal splits and branches, leading to significantly better performance.  This hardcoded tree serves only as a conceptual illustration.
