This function mirrors the hypothetical decision tree structure from the previous response.  It uses the specified feature names and encoding. The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values of the inner node conditions. Remember, this is still a hypothetical tree; its accuracy depends entirely on whether these assumptions hold true in a real boxing match scenario.  A real decision tree would be trained on actual data.
