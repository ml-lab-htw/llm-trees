```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Since we don't have predictive features, we'll create a very simple tree
    # based on the round and a specific judge, which isn't truly predictive
    # but demonstrates the structure you requested.  This model is NOT accurate.

    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6  # First half of the fight
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Judge E. Williams
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1 # Official Judge

    if nodes[0]:  # Early rounds
        if nodes[1]: # Judge E. Williams
            if nodes[2]: # Official Judge
                prediction = 1 # Lewis (Arbitrary)
            else:
                prediction = 0 # Holyfield (Arbitrary)
        else: # Other Judges
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (Arbitrary)
    else:  # Later rounds
        if nodes[2]: # Official Judge
            prediction = 1 # Lewis (Arbitrary)
        else:
            prediction = 0 #Holyfield (Arbitrary)



    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage (replace with your actual data):
example_features = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

example_features = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 0, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```

**Crucial Notes:**

* **This model is not accurate.**  It's a demonstration of the requested format, *not* a good boxing prediction model.  The features you've provided do not predict the round winner.
* **To build a real model, you need predictive features.** See my previous response for examples.
* The thresholds used (Round 6, Judge E. Williams) are arbitrary placeholders.  With appropriate features, these would be determined through a machine learning training process.


This revised answer provides the Python function in the requested format, along with clear explanations of the limitations due to the nature of the provided features.  I've also included example usage to show how the function works. Remember to replace the example data with your own and, most importantly, gather better predictive features if you want to create a useful boxing prediction model.
