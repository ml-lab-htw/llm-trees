```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Is it Judge E. Williams?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Is the round in the first half of the fight?

    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # E. Williams
            if nodes[2]: # First half
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else: # Second half
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else: # Not E. Williams (Other Official Judges)
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (Assumed majority favored Lewis)
    else: # Not an Official Judge
        prediction = 1  # Lewis (Assumed unofficial judges leaned towards Lewis)

    return prediction, nodes



```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the provided feature encoding (0 for E. Williams, 1 for Yes on "Official", etc.)

2. **Thresholds:** The thresholds are based on the provided example decision tree logic.  The round split at 6 is a reasonable guess, representing a potential shift in the fight dynamic.  However, with real data, these thresholds would be learned by the decision tree algorithm.

3. **Missing Data:** The provided tree structure doesn't handle potential missing values.  In a real application, you would need to implement strategies to handle missing data (imputation, using a default value, etc.).

4. **Assumptions:** The example decision tree makes assumptions about how certain judges voted.  With real data, these assumptions wouldn't be necessary, as the decision tree algorithm would determine the best splits based on the actual patterns in the data.

5. **Return Values:** The function returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list `nodes` containing the truth values (1 or 0) for the conditions at each inner node. This aligns with the requested format.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, True]


X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, False, False]

X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, False, True]
```


This improved function correctly implements the decision tree logic and provides the required outputs.  To create a truly data-driven decision tree, you would need to train a decision tree algorithm on a real boxing dataset.
