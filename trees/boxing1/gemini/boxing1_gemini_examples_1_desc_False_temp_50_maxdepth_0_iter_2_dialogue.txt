Since you haven't provided training data, I'll create a plausible decision tree based on the features and reasonable assumptions about the fight.  Remember, a real-world tree would be trained on actual fight data.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield)
               and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Assume early rounds favored Lewis
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 4

    # Assume later rounds were more contested, and official judges mattered more
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] > 4 and X['Official'] == 1  # Official judge

    # Assume E. Williams favored Holyfield in later rounds
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 0 and X['Round'] > 4 # E. Williams and late round

    # Assume close rounds went to Holyfield if not scored by E. Williams
    nodes[3] = X['Round'] > 4 and X['Official'] == 0 and X['Judge'] != 0  # Unofficial Judges, after round 4



    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds
    elif nodes[1]:  # Later rounds, official judges
      if nodes[2]: # E. Williams favors Holyfield
        prediction = 0
      else:
        prediction = 1 # Other Official Judges still lean towards Lewis
    elif nodes[3]: # Non-official Judges, later rounds 
        prediction = 0 # Holyfield gets close calls 
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins if no other conditions met



    return prediction, nodes




# Example usage (replace with your actual feature values)
example_features = {
    'Judge': 0,  # E. Williams
    'Official': 1,  # Official judge
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")

example_features = {
    'Judge': 1,  # L. O'Connell
    'Official': 1,  # Official judge
    'Round': 10
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")

example_features = {
    'Judge': 9,  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
    'Official': 0,  # Not official judge
    'Round': 1
}


prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")

```


This example provides a reasonable hypothetical decision tree. **To get a truly accurate and useful tree, you must provide real fight data for training.** The structure of the tree (which features are most important, what the thresholds are) will be determined by the patterns in the data itself.  The code then becomes a direct translation of the learned rules into Python.
