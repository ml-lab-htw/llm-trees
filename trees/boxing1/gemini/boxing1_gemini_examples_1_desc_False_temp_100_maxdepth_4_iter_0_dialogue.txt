This function replicates the example decision tree provided earlier.  Remember: this is based on hypothetical feature importance and split points.  Real data and training would be required to create a truly accurate decision tree model. The `nodes` list provides insight into the path taken through the tree, based on which conditions were true or false.  This is helpful for understanding the reasoning behind the prediction.
