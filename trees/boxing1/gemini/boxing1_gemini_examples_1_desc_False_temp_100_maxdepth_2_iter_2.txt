```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Splitting based on Judge <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Splitting based on Round <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0 # Example prediction - adjust as needed
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Example prediction - adjust as needed
    else:
        prediction = 1 # Example prediction - adjust as needed

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Reasoning:**

The generated decision tree uses "Judge" and "Round" as the splitting features.  Here's the logic:

1. **Maximum Depth 2:** The tree has a maximum depth of 2, meaning there are at most two levels of decision nodes below the root.

2. **Feature Selection (Heuristic):**  Since we don't have actual data to train on, we need a heuristic to choose features.  I've selected "Judge" and "Round" based on the following intuition:

   - **Judge:** The judge might have a bias towards one fighter or another, so it could be an important predictor. The split `Judge <= 4` divides the judges into two groups.
   - **Round:** The round number could also be relevant.  A fighter might be stronger in earlier rounds versus later rounds. The split `Round <= 6` divides the fight into two halves.

3. **Predictions (Placeholders):**  Because we're not training on data, the predictions (0 or 1) at the leaf nodes are just example placeholders.  In a real application, these predictions would be determined by the majority class in each leaf node during training.

4. **List of Truth Values (nodes):**  The `nodes` list stores the boolean values (True/False or 1/0) resulting from evaluating the conditions at each internal node.  This list provides a trace of how a particular example travels down the tree.



**Important Note:** Without actual training data, this decision tree is not likely to be a good predictor. The feature selection and the predictions are purely based on heuristic reasoning and will likely need to be adjusted based on training data in a real-world scenario.
