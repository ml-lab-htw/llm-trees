def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge = Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4  # Round <= 4
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0 and X["Round"] > 4  # Judge = E. Williams and Round > 4 (Simplified example)
    nodes[3] = (X["Judge"] == 3 and X["Official"] == 0) and (X["Judge"] == 4 and X["Official"] == 0) # HBO-Lederman and Sportsticker, and not official judges


    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 4
            prediction = 1  # Placeholder: Assume Lewis wins in early rounds with official judges (needs real data)
        else:  # Round > 4
            if nodes[2]: # Judge = E. Williams (Example, requires data for realistic logic)
                prediction = 1 #Assume Lewis Wins if E. Williams scores him higher. 
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Assume Holyfield wins (Simplified for depth constraint)
    else:  # Official Judge = No
        if nodes[3]: # HBO and Sportsticker favor Lewis
            prediction = 1 # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Assume Holyfield wins (Simplified for depth constraint)

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Nodes List:** The `nodes` list now correctly stores the truth values (True/False) of each decision node. This allows you to inspect the decision path taken for any given input.
* **Feature Encoding:**  The code uses the specified feature encoding (e.g., 0 for E. Williams, 1 for Yes for "Official").
* **Placeholder Logic:** The decision logic still uses placeholder assumptions because we don't have real data.  For example, it assumes Lewis wins in early rounds with official judges. This must be replaced with data-driven logic once training data is available.
* **Combined Conditions:** The code shows how to combine conditions, like checking for E. Williams *and* Round > 4.
* **Non-Official Logic:** There's a simplified example for Non-Official judges, combining HBO-Lederman and Sportsticker scores.  This assumes we are checking both judges at the same time and they are also not official judges.  This likely needs refinement with real data.



**Crucially, to make this a useful decision tree, you *must* provide training data so that the tree can learn the actual relationships between judges' scores, rounds, and the round winner.**  The current version is just a structured guess.
