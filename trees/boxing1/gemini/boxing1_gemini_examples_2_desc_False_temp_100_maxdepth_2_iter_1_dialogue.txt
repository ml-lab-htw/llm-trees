It's impossible to determine the best features and thresholds for the decision tree without any data. The examples you provided are for diabetes prediction and use completely different features. 

However, I can give you a template Python function based on a hypothetical decision tree for the boxing match. Let's assume (for demonstration purposes) that:

* **Important Feature 1:** `Official` - Official judges have more weight in deciding the round winner.
* **Important Feature 2:** `Judge` -  Some judges might be biased towards a specific fighter.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # If official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Assuming E. Williams favors Lewis 

    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins 
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Default to Holyfield if not an official judge

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nodes` list:** Stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions at each node.
2. **Root Node (`nodes[0]`):**  Checks if the judge is an "Official" judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
3. **Left Child (`nodes[1]`):** If the judge is "Official," it then checks if the `Judge` is "E. Williams" (`X["Judge"] == 0`).  We're assuming (hypothetically) that E. Williams tends to favor Lewis.
4. **Predictions:**  The function assigns a prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) based on the combination of conditions met.

**To make this function truly useful:**

1. **You need data:**  A dataset of rounds, judges' scores, and the actual round winner is necessary.
2. **Feature Selection:** Use statistical methods or feature importance scores from decision tree algorithms to determine the most important features. 
3. **Threshold Selection:** Use the training data to find optimal thresholds for your chosen features.

Remember, this example is highly simplified and based on assumptions. A real-world application would require proper data analysis and model training.
