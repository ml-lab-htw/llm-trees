```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 4  # First split: Early vs. Late rounds
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 3]  # Second split (if Round <= 4): Specific judges

    if nodes[0]:  # Early Rounds
        if nodes[1]:  # Judges favoring Lewis in early rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # Other judges in early rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # Later Rounds
        if X["Judge"] in [2, 4, 5]:  # Judges favoring Holyfield in later rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # Other judges in later rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes

```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Encoding:** The code uses the numerical encoding provided for the "Judge" feature.
* **Thresholds:**  The round split at 4 and the judge groupings remain illustrative.  With real data, these would be optimized.
* **Later Round Logic:**  The second split for later rounds now checks for judges potentially favoring Holyfield (2, 4, and 5), making the logic more consistent with the initial description.
* **Clarity:**  Comments explain the logic at each branch.
* **No Data Dependency:** As requested, the function doesn't require training data and builds the tree directly based on the provided structure.

**How to Use:**

You can call the function with a dictionary representing a single round's data:

```python
example_round = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 2}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}")
```


This example would predict Lewis as the winner because it's an early round (Round 2 <= 4), and Judge 0 (E. Williams) is in the set of judges favoring Lewis in early rounds.  The `nodes` list would be `[True, True]`.


Remember that this decision tree is still a simplified illustration. Its accuracy depends entirely on how well the chosen features, splits, and judge groupings reflect the real fight dynamics.  Real-world decision trees learn these patterns from data.
