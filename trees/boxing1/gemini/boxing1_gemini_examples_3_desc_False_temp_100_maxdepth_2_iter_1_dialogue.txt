```python

def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] <= 4.5
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6.5

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Likely Holyfield won early rounds based on limited judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Potentially Lewis did better in later rounds
    else:
        prediction = 1      # Assuming judges beyond index 4 favored Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
