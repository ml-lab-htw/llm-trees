example_features = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, node_values = predict(example_features)

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

* **Placeholders:** I've filled in some example thresholds and logic, but you **must** replace these with thresholds and splits learned from your actual data.  These examples are just to demonstrate the structure.
* **Feature Encoding:** The code assumes that the categorical features ("Judge" and "Official") have already been encoded as specified in your prompt.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** The structure and thresholds in a real decision tree are determined by training the model on a dataset.  The provided example is illustrative and not likely to be accurate for real-world boxing data.  You need to use a decision tree algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) to train a model on your data.
* **Complexity:** Real decision trees might be significantly more complex than this example.
* **Interpretability:** One of the advantages of decision trees is their interpretability. The `node_values` list helps you understand the path taken through the tree to arrive at the prediction.


Once you have your actual boxing data (with who won each round), you can use scikit-learn to train a decision tree and then extract the learned structure to create a function like this one that accurately reflects the model's decisions.
