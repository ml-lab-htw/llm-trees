**Explanation of the Decision Tree Logic:**

The decision tree generated above makes predictions based on a combination of the given features: "Judge," "Round," and "Official."  It is structured to have a maximum depth of 3 and contain 3 inner nodes (decision points). 

The splits are chosen heuristically based on reasonable assumptions about how these features might influence the outcome of a boxing round. For instance, we might assume official judges are more likely to favor the eventual winner (Lewis, in this scenario), and early rounds might have different outcomes than later rounds.

**Important Notes:**

* **No Training Data:**  This decision tree is *not* trained on any data. It is built based on intuitive assumptions about the features.  Its accuracy on real-world boxing data would be highly uncertain without proper training.
* **Heuristic Splits:**  The conditions used at each node (e.g., `Judge <= 4`, `Round <= 6`) are chosen heuristically.  With actual training data, a machine learning algorithm would determine the optimal splits to maximize predictive accuracy.
* **Maximum Depth:** The tree respects the maximum depth constraint of 3.
* **Inner Nodes List:** The `nodes` list provides a clear record of which branches of the tree were taken during prediction, facilitating analysis and interpretation.


To make this a truly useful decision tree, you would need to train it on a dataset of boxing rounds, their outcomes, and the corresponding judge, round, and official information.  A decision tree learning algorithm would then automatically find the best splits at each node to create a more accurate model.
