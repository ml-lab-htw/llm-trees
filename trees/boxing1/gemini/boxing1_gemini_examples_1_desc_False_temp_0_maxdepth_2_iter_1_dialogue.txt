def predict(X: dict):

    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the input features:
            - 'Judge': Judge (0-9)
            - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
            - 'Round': Round (1-12)

    Returns:

               and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Clearer Logic:** The code now directly reflects the decision tree logic described earlier.
* **Specific Judge:**  The code uses `X["Judge"] == 3` to represent the "HBO-Lederman favors Lewis" branch.  Remember, this is a placeholder example.  With real data, you could identify specific judges and their tendencies.
* **Simplified "Draw" Condition:**  For simplicity, the "Draw" outcome has been replaced by a Holyfield prediction when the judge is not official and not HBO-Lederman.  A true "Draw" prediction would require a more complex tree structure or a multi-class classification approach.
* **Type Hinting:** The function uses type hinting (`X: dict`) for better readability and maintainability.



To make this a truly useful model, you need data.  Gather round-by-round results with judge scores and use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn) to train a real decision tree classifier. The algorithm will find the optimal splits and features automatically.  This code provides a functional template, but real data is essential for accurate predictions.
