```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth 1

    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 8  # Using Round as the splitting feature

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield predicted for earlier rounds
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis predicted for later rounds

    return prediction, nodes
