**Explanation of the Generated Decision Tree and its Limitations:**

The generated decision tree uses the provided feature names ("Judge", "Official", "Round") to create a series of conditional checks (the `if/else` blocks).  The `nodes` list stores the truth value (1 or 0) of each condition.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:** This decision tree is **not** trained on any actual boxing data. It is a purely illustrative example based on the requested format and depth constraints. The splits are somewhat arbitrary and reflect a hypothetical scenario (e.g., perhaps imagining Lewis was stronger in earlier rounds and certain judges were biased).
* **Feature Importance:**  Since there's no training, the concept of "most important features" cannot be applied in a meaningful way.  The choices of which feature to use for each split are arbitrary in this context.
* **Depth and Nodes:** The code fulfills the requirement of a maximum depth of 4 and between 4 and 15 inner nodes (it has 4).
* **Predictive Power:**  This decision tree has *no real predictive power* for boxing outcomes. To create a useful model, you would need a labeled dataset of boxing rounds, train a real decision tree classifier on that data, and let the algorithm learn the best splits based on patterns in the data.


To use this function, you would call it with a dictionary representing the features of a single boxing round:

```python
example_round = {"Judge": 8, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}  # ESPN, Official, Round 3
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

```
