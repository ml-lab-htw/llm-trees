It's still difficult to determine round winners based solely on judge information without any context of the fight itself. However, I can show you how to build a decision tree with the provided features and a hypothetical outcome. 

**Assumptions:**

* **Official Judges Matter More:** We'll assume the `Official` judge has a stronger influence on the round outcome. 
* **Some Judges Favor Lewis:** Let's say, for example, judges 'E. Williams' and 'Sportsline' tend to score rounds slightly in favor of Lewis.

**Here's a possible decision tree function (depth 2):**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"]  == 0   # Is it 'E. Williams'?
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"]  == 6   # Is it 'Sportsline'?

    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        prediction = 1  # Likely Lewis win, assuming official judges lean towards Lewis slightly 
    else:  # If it's not an official judge
        if nodes[1] or nodes[2]:  # Check for 'E. Williams' or 'Sportsline'
            prediction = 1  # Slightly higher chance of Lewis win
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Slightly higher chance of Holyfield win

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Root Node (`nodes[0]`):**  The tree first checks if the judge is an official (`Official == 1`).
2. **Branch 1 (Official Judge):**  If `nodes[0]` is True, we assume a higher likelihood of a Lewis win (you can change this based on your assumptions).
3. **Branch 2 (Unofficial Judge):** If `nodes[0]` is False, we check for the specific judges (`nodes[1]` and `nodes[2]`) who we assumed might favor Lewis.

**Important Notes:**

* **This is a very simplified example.**  Realistically, predicting boxing round winners requires much more data about the fight's dynamics.
* **Feature engineering** is crucial. You could create Features, like an "average score difference" between Lewis and Holyfield for each judge, to improve the model.
* **Data is key.**  The accuracy of any decision tree (or any machine learning model) depends heavily on the quality and amount of training data.

This example demonstrates how to structure a decision tree function in Python. To create a more accurate model, you would need to analyze real boxing data, identify important features, and potentially use more sophisticated machine learning techniques.
