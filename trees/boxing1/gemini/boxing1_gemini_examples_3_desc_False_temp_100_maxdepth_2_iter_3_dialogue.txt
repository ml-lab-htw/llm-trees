It's impossible to build a truly accurate decision tree without data on how judges scored each round. However, I can create a simplified model based on the limited information and assumptions about judging tendencies. This example assumes 'Official' judges hold more weight in the decision:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
  """
  Predicts the winner of a boxing round between Lewis and Holyfield.

  Args:
    X: A dictionary of features.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) 
    and a list of truth values for the decision nodes.
  """
  nodes = 3 * [None]
  nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
  nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [3, 4, 5, 8]  # Judges potentially favoring Lewis
  nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6  # Early rounds might favor Lewis

  if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
    if nodes[1]:  # Judge known to potentially favor Lewis
      prediction = 1  # Lewis win
    else: 
      prediction = 0  # Holyfield win
  else:  # Unofficial judge
    if nodes[2]:  # Early round
      prediction = 1  # Lewis win
    else:
      prediction = 0  # Holyfield win 

  return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

* **Depth 1:** The tree prioritizes whether the judge is 'Official'. This assumes official judges have a larger impact on the final decision. 
* **Depth 2:**
    * **Official Judge branch:** It checks if the judge is among those potentially more likely to score in favor of Lewis (this is a hypothetical example and needs real data to be accurate). 
    * **Unofficial Judge branch:**  It checks if it's an early round, assuming Lewis might be favored in early rounds due to some fighting style.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Required:** This is a highly simplified model. To create a meaningful decision tree, you need data on actual round scoring by judges for past Lewis vs. Holyfield fights.
* **Feature Engineering:**  You could incorporate more complex features like punch stats, ring control, and aggression, which would likely improve the model.
* **Threshold Selection:** The choice of judges and round split (round 6) is arbitrary without data. You'll need to analyze actual fight data to determine appropriate thresholds.

Remember, this is a starting point for illustration. Real-world application requires data-driven analysis and likely a more sophisticated model.
