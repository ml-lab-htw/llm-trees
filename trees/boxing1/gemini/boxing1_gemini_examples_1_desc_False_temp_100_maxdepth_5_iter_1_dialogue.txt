def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Increased size to accommodate more nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 3
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1 # Yes
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] == 1



    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis (slightly higher chance, but still Lewis in this simplified example)
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0 # Holyfield
            else:
                 prediction = 1 #Lewis

    else:  # Round > 3
        # Simplified assumption: Holyfield wins later rounds
        prediction = 0


    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Node List:** The `nodes` list is initialized with enough `None` values to store the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.  The example provided needed more space than initially allocated.
* **Judge Encoding:** I used the numerical encoding you provided for the judges. The `in` operator checks if the judge's encoded value is among those favoring Lewis in the early rounds (in this hypothetical scenario).
* **Official Judge:**  The condition checks if the "Official" feature is 1 (Yes).
* **Round Number:**  Conditions check if the round is within the first three.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The decision tree logic is still simplified, favoring Lewis in early rounds if judged by Williams or O'Connell, and slightly favoring Holyfield if judged by other judges in round 1, and strongly favouring Holyfield in rounds after 3. This is just an illustration. Real data would lead to much more complex branching.
* **No Data, No Real Training:** Remember, this decision tree is *not* trained on any actual data. It's a hypothetical structure based on the provided features and a simplified, made-up scoring pattern.


To improve this, you *must* provide real boxing scoring data. With data, we can use libraries like scikit-learn to train a real decision tree (or a more appropriate model) and achieve much better predictive performance.  The function structure will remain similar, but the conditions and branching will be determined by the learned patterns in the data.
