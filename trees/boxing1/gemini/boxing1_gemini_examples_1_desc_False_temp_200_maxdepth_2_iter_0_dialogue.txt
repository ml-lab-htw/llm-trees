**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Encoding:** The `Judge` feature is now encoded numerically (0-9), matching your provided encoding.
* **Draw:** The prediction now outputs 0.5 to represent a draw in the appropriate branch.  In a real application, you might use a dedicated class label for "Draw" instead.
* **Clarity:**  The comments make the logic easier to follow and connect back to the original decision tree structure.
* **Testability:**  The example usage demonstrates how to call the `predict` function and interpret the output.


This improved function addresses the formatting and encoding requirements while preserving the logic of the original hypothetical decision tree. Remember, this tree is still based on assumptions and would need to be trained on real data for accurate boxing match predictions.
