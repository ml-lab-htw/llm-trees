def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4 # Check if round <= 4 (only applies if official judge)
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 3 # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (only applies if not official judge)

    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # Round <= 4
            prediction = 1 # Lewis Wins
        else:  # Round > 4
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield Wins
    else: # Not Official Judge
        if nodes[2]: # Judge is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # Lewis Wins
        else: # Other Judge
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield Wins
    
    return prediction, nodes

```


This function reflects the previously described hypothetical decision tree. It checks the "Official" feature first, then uses either "Round" (if official) or "Judge" (if not official) to make a prediction.  The `nodes` list stores the boolean values of the conditions at each decision point in the tree.


Remember that without real training data, this function's accuracy is purely hypothetical.  The chosen thresholds (Round <= 4, Judge == HBO-Lederman) are for illustrative purposes.  A real-world application requires a proper training process on a dataset of fight results.
