It's impossible to build a reliable decision tree to predict boxing round winners based solely on the judge, official, and round number. These features are insufficient to capture the complexity of a boxing match. 

However, I can demonstrate how to structure the Python function you requested using a simplified, hypothetical decision tree.  

**Hypothetical Decision Tree (oversimplified for demonstration):**

* **Rule 1:** If the round is late (e.g., Round > 9) AND the judge is known for favoring aggression (e.g., Judge = 'HBO-Lederman'), predict Lewis (assuming Lewis is generally the more aggressive fighter).
* **Rule 2:** Otherwise, predict Holyfield.

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict_round_winner(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = (X['Round'] > 9) and (X['Judge'] == 3)  # 3 = 'HBO-Lederman' 

    if nodes[0]:  # Late round and judge favors aggression
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes 

# Example usage
example_features = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 11}
prediction, nodes = predict_round_winner(example_features)

print(f"Prediction (Lewis=1, Holyfield=0): {prediction}")
print(f"Node Truth Values: {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

* **`predict_round_winner(X: dict)`:**  Takes a dictionary `X` containing the features.
* **`nodes`:**  A list to store the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of each decision node in the tree. 
* **Decision Logic:** The code implements the two hypothetical rules described above.
* **Output:** Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the `nodes` list.

**Important Notes:**

* **This is a highly simplified and unrealistic example.** A real boxing prediction model would require much more sophisticated features and decision logic.
* You'll need to replace the placeholder rules with meaningful ones based on actual boxing knowledge or patterns you might find in a suitable dataset (if available). 
* Feature engineering would likely be crucial for a real-world model. For example, you could create features like "Punch Count Difference" or "Aggression Score" based on more detailed data.
