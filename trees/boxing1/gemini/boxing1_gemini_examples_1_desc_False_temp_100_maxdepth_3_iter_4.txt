**Explanation of the Decision Tree Logic (Example)**

The generated decision tree uses a simplified logic based on the provided features.  Here's a possible interpretation (remember, this is generated without data, so it's illustrative):

1. **Judge <= 4:** This might represent a group of judges perceived to favor one fighter (e.g., Lewis).  If the judge is in this group (Judge <= 4 is True), it's more likely to predict a win for that fighter.

2. **Round <= 6:**  This splits based on the round.  Earlier rounds might favor one fighter, while later rounds favor the other (due to fatigue, strategy changes, etc.).

3. **Official == 1:** This considers whether the judge is "official." The assumption might be that official judges are more reliable or consistent in their scoring.


**Important Considerations**

* **No Training Data:**  This decision tree is *not* trained on any real boxing data.  It creates arbitrary splits based on the features.  The logic it represents is purely hypothetical.
* **Feature Importance:**  The choice of which features to use and the order of the splits are also arbitrary in this example.  A real decision tree algorithm would use information gain or Gini impurity to determine the best splits.
* **Depth Limitation:** The `max_depth=3` constraint is respected, resulting in a tree with three levels of decisions (and thus, between 3 and 7 inner nodes, as specified).



To create a *meaningful* decision tree, you would need to train it on actual data using a library like scikit-learn. The above function demonstrates the format and structure required, but it does not have predictive power without training.
