```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # We'll use 'Official' and 'Round' as our features for the depth-2 tree.
    # Since we don't have real data, we'll create arbitrary splits.
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is it an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6     # Is it in the first half of the fight?

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]:  # First half of the fight
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Second half of the fight
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Not an Official Judge
        prediction = 1 # Lewis (arbitrary choice for demonstration)

    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Arbitrary Splits:** Because we are generating the tree *without training*, the split points (`Official == 1` and `Round <= 6`) are arbitrary.  In a real-world scenario, these would be determined based on the data during training.
* **Feature Selection (Simplified):** I've chosen "Official" and "Round" as the features for the demonstration.  In a real application, you'd use feature selection techniques (like information gain) to determine the best features.
* **Handling the "Judge" Feature:** The "Judge" feature (as currently encoded 0-9) isn't easily used in a simple decision tree without further processing or one-hot encoding.  If you had judge scores, you could use those directly.
* **Depth Limitation:** The function adheres to the depth-2 requirement.
* **Truth Values:** The `nodes` list correctly stores the truth values (1 or 0) representing whether the condition at each node is met.


To improve this further, you would need actual round-by-round scores from each judge.  With that data, you could train a real decision tree classifier and have much more meaningful splits and predictions.
