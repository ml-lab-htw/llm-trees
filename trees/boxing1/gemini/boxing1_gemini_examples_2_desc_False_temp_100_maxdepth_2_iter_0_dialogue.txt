```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Rule 1: If the round is less than or equal to 6 
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6 
    
    # Rule 2: If the judge is HBO-Lederman (encoded as 3)
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins 

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

This decision tree function uses the following logic:

- **Node 0:** Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6. This split is based on the idea that early rounds might favor one fighter.
- **Node 1 (only evaluated if Node 0 is True):**  Checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman. This suggests that HBO-Lederman might have a bias towards Lewis in early rounds.
- **Predictions:**
    - If both nodes are True (early round and judged by HBO-Lederman), predict Lewis as the winner (1).
    - If Node 0 is True (early round) but Node 1 is False (different judge), predict Holyfield as the winner (0).
    - If Node 0 is False (later rounds), predict Holyfield as the winner (0).

**Important Considerations:**

* This decision tree is highly simplified and based on assumptions about the data. The actual important features and thresholds would need to be determined through data analysis and model training.
* A more complex tree with more features and a greater depth might be needed to capture the nuances of the boxing matches accurately.
* This example illustrates the structure and logic of the `predict` function. You can adapt and expand it based on your specific data and insights.
