You are right to point out that directly using decision trees for predicting round winners based solely on these features might be too simplistic. However, I will show you how to build such a decision tree based on your provided structure. 

Keep in mind, this is for illustrative purposes and might not lead to a highly accurate model for predicting boxing match outcomes. 

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1 
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] <= 4
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis likely wins if official & Judge <= 4
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield might win if official & Judge > 4
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield might win if unofficial & Round <=6
        else:
            prediction = 1 # Lewis likely wins if unofficial & Round > 6

    return prediction, nodes 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** We create a list `nodes` with a size of 3, representing the maximum possible inner nodes for a depth-2 decision tree.
2. **Feature Selection and Thresholding:**
   - `nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1`: This checks if the judge is official or not.
   - `nodes[1] = X['Judge'] <= 4`: This splits judges into two groups based on a somewhat arbitrary threshold (you might want to investigate better thresholds).
   - `nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6`: This checks if the round is in the first half of the fight. 
3. **Decision Logic:** The `if-else` statements implement the decision tree logic:
    - If the judge is official (`nodes[0]`), it further branches based on the `Judge` threshold (`nodes[1]`). 
    - If the judge is not official, it branches based on the `Round` threshold (`nodes[2]`).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Threshold Selection:** The chosen thresholds for `Judge` and `Round` are somewhat arbitrary. You would need a larger dataset and potentially more sophisticated feature engineering to determine more meaningful thresholds.
* **Data Limitations:** The limited features might not be sufficient to accurately predict round winners. Consider including more informative features like punch stats, ring control, etc.
* **Model Complexity:** A depth-2 decision tree might be too simplistic. You could explore deeper trees or other machine learning models for better performance.

This example demonstrates the structure of such a decision tree function. Remember to experiment with different features, thresholds, and model complexities to find the best approach for your boxing prediction task.
