```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list for truth values of nodes

    # Hypothetical thresholds - replace with values learned from actual data
    official_judge_threshold = 0.5 #  If probability of Official being 1 (Yes) > threshold
    round_threshold = 6.5  # Round threshold

    # Conditions from hypothetical decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] > official_judge_threshold  # Check if it's an Official Judge
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0 and X["Official"] == 1 # Check for E.Williams and Official Judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= round_threshold  # Check Round number


    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge is yes/1
        if nodes[1]: # E.Williams gave the verdict
            prediction = 1 # Assuming E. Williams heavily favors Lewis
        else:  # If it's a different official judge
            prediction = 0  # Assuming other official judges favor Holyfield (hypothetical)
    else:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # Assume Lewis wins early rounds (hypothetical)
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Assume Holyfield wins later rounds (hypothetical)

    return prediction, [int(node) for node in nodes] # Convert boolean to integer



# Example usage (replace with your actual feature values)
example_features = {
    "Judge": 0,  # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,  # Official Judge
    "Round": 3  # Round 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield): {prediction}")
print(f"Node truth values: {nodes}")


example_features = {
    "Judge": 1,  # L.O'Connell
    "Official": 1,  # Official Judge
    "Round": 11  # Round 11
}

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clearer Structure:**  The code now closely reflects the structure of a decision tree, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds.  **It's crucial to replace these with values learned from your training data.** You'll need to use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) to determine the best thresholds.
* **Node Truth Values:** The function now returns a list of integers representing the truth values (0 or 1) of each decision node, as requested.
* **Example Usage:** I've included example usage to demonstrate how to call the function.



**Next Steps:**

1. **Provide Data:**  You *must* provide the data of judges' decisions and round outcomes to train a real decision tree.
2. **Use a Decision Tree Library:** Use a library like scikit-learn (in Python) to train a decision tree on your data.  This will determine the optimal tree structure, feature importance, and threshold values. Don't attempt to build a decision tree classifier from scratch unless you have a very good reason to. Libraries are highly optimized and much more robust.
3. **Replace Placeholders:** Once you've trained a decision tree model, replace the placeholder thresholds and conditions in the `predict` function with the values learned from your model.



This revised response provides a more functional and useful template that you can adapt after training a real decision tree model. Remember that without the data, this is still just a hypothetical example.
