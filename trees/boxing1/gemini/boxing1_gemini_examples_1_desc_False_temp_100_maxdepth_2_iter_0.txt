```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Split based on Judge (somewhat arbitrary, but limited options)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6   # Split based on Round

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Example: Early rounds, Judges <= 4 favor Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Example: Later rounds, Judges <= 4 favor Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 1     # Example: Judges > 4 favor Lewis regardless of round


    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Generated Tree (and its limitations):**

The provided features ("Judge", "Official", and "Round") don't have an inherent, obvious relationship to determine the round winner like the diabetes example did.  Therefore, the generated tree uses arbitrary splits.

* **Depth 1 (Root):**  `X["Judge"] <= 4` splits the judges into two groups. This split is arbitrary; there's no training data to suggest which judge is more likely to favor a particular boxer.
* **Depth 2 (Intermediate Nodes):** `X["Round"] <= 6` splits the rounds into early (1-6) and late (7-12). This is a more reasonable split as boxing matches can change momentum.
* **Leaf Nodes (Predictions):** The predictions (0 or 1) at the leaf nodes are also illustrative.  Without training data, it's impossible to know which combination of judge and round would favor which fighter.  The example code provides a plausible scenario where early rounds and certain judges might favor one boxer, while later rounds or different judges might favor the other.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Training Data:**  The biggest limitation is the lack of training data.  The generated tree is not predictive; it's a demonstration of a decision tree structure with the specified depth and features.
* **Feature Importance:**  Without training data, feature importance cannot be determined. The selected features and split points are illustrative.
* **Arbitrary Splits:** The splits are based on seemingly reasonable divisions of the feature values, but are essentially arbitrary without data to inform them.

To create a truly useful decision tree, you'd need a dataset of boxing matches with the given features and the target variable ("target").  You would then train a decision tree algorithm on this data, which would learn the optimal splits and create a model capable of making predictions.
