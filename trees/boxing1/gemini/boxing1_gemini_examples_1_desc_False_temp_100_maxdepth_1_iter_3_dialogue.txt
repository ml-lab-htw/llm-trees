```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth 1

    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Split based on Official Judge

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0.5  # Placeholder: No data to determine likely winner based on official judges
    else:
        prediction = 0.5  # Placeholder: No data to determine likely winner based on unofficial judges

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Single Node:** The `nodes` list now only has one element, reflecting the single split in a depth-1 tree.
* **Official Judge Split:**  The condition `X["Official"] == 1` checks if the judge is official.
* **Placeholder Predictions:** Because we don't have the actual round-by-round data, we can't determine the most likely winner based on official vs. unofficial judges. I've used `0.5` as a placeholder prediction representing an equal chance of either fighter winning in both branches.  *This should be replaced with the empirical win probabilities once data is provided.*  For instance, if official judges favored Lewis 60% of the time, the prediction in the `if` branch would be `1` (for Lewis) or a probability of `0.6`.  If they favored Holyfield, the prediction would be `0` or `0.4`.


**How to Use with Data:**

Once you provide round-by-round data, you can calculate the probabilities mentioned above and replace the placeholder predictions.  You would also be able to evaluate alternative splits (e.g., based on the "Round" feature or combinations of features if you increase the tree depth) to find the most informative splits that best separate Lewis and Holyfield wins.  The "Judge" feature could be useful in a deeper tree, but it's less likely to be the most important feature for the very first split in a depth-1 tree.
