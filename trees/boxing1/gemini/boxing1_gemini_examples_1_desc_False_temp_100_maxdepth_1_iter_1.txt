```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
      prediction = 0  # Assuming Holyfield is more likely to win earlier rounds
    else:
      prediction = 1 # Assuming Lewis is more likely to win later rounds
    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

Since we're constrained to a depth of 1, the decision tree will have a single decision node.  We need to select the most important feature for this node.  Without any data to train on, we must make a reasonable guess. In a boxing match, the "Round" feature seems likely to be the most informative in a simplistic model.  Earlier rounds might favor one fighter due to their style or strategy, while later rounds might favor the other due to endurance or accumulated damage. 

Therefore, the generated decision tree uses "Round" as the splitting feature. The threshold 6.5 splits the rounds into two groups (rounds 1-6 and rounds 7-12).  The predictions associated with each branch are arbitrary in the absence of real data; I've made an assumption that Holyfield might be stronger in earlier rounds and Lewis in later rounds â€“ but this is just a placeholder and would need adjustment with real-world data.

**Important Notes:**

* This decision tree is **not** trained on any data. It is a heuristic based solely on the feature names and a very simplified assumption about boxing match dynamics.
* In a real-world scenario, you would **never** build a decision tree this way.  You would always train it on a dataset to determine the best features, splits, and predictions.
* The choice of "Round" and the split point 6.5, as well as the predictions 0 and 1, are essentially arbitrary without training data.  They are meant to illustrate the structure of a depth-1 decision tree and its representation as a Python function.
* The feature "Official" seems very relevant, but we can't use it at depth 1, and we can't make meaningful guesses about Judge interactions at depth 1. "Round" provides the most obvious guess at a splitting point based on intuition alone.
