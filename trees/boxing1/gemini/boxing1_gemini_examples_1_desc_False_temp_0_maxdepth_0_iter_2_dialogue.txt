def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values of nodes

    # Hypothetical thresholds â€“ adjust based on actual data analysis
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 4  # Early rounds
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman (adjust if another judge is more significant)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 8  # Mid-rounds
    nodes[4] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge (again for later rounds)


    if nodes[0]:  # Early rounds
        if nodes[1]:  # Official Judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (assumed to win early rounds per official judges)
        else:  # Not Official Judge
            if nodes[2]:  # HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 1  # Lewis (assumed Lederman favored Lewis early)
            else:  # Other unofficial judges
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else: # Later Rounds (Round > 4)
        if nodes[3]: # Mid-rounds (4 < Round <= 8)
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield (assumed stronger mid-game)
        else: # Late rounds (Round > 8)
            if nodes[4]:  # Official Judge
                prediction = 0.5 # Representing a Draw or Split (could be handled differently)
                                    # You might need a more complex structure to handle draws specifically.
            else: # Not official judge
                prediction = 1 # Lewis (assumed unofficial judges favored Lewis late)


    return prediction, nodes  # Return prediction and truth values


# Example usage:
example_features = {
    "Judge": 3,  # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0, # No
    "Round": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") #  Should predict Lewis (1)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

example_features = {
    "Judge": 0, # E. Williams
    "Official": 1, # Yes
    "Round": 10
}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}") # Should predict Draw/Split (0.5)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Node List Initialization:**  `nodes = 5 * [None]` creates a list of 5 `None` values. This properly initializes the list before we assign truth values (True/False) to each element.
* **Thresholds:** I've added placeholder thresholds based on the hypothetical tree structure.  These would need to be adjusted based on your real data analysis.  Determining the optimal thresholds is a key part of decision tree learning.
* **Draw/Split Handling:** The code now includes a placeholder (0.5) to represent a Draw or Split decision. In a real application, you might want a separate output category for draws, or a more sophisticated way to handle split decisions.
* **Clearer Structure:**  The `if/else` structure is more organized, mirroring the hypothetical decision tree logic.
* **Example Usage:** Added example usage with dictionaries of features to demonstrate how to call the `predict` function.


**Crucially:** This code still relies on *assumed* relationships between the features and the target.  To get a real, working, and accurate decision tree, you **must** provide the actual fight data.  The more data, the better the tree will be able to learn and generalize. Once you provide the data, I can help you train a decision tree model using a library like scikit-learn, which will determine the optimal thresholds and tree structure automatically.
