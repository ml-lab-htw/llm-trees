def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]

    # Simplified decision tree based on hypothetical judge tendencies
    #  and some basic round considerations.
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams (Hypothetical: Favors Holyfield)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 1  # L. O'Connell (Hypothetical: Favors Lewis)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1 # Official Judge
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 4    # Early rounds

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[2]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[3]:  # Early Round
            prediction = 0.5 # Draw (or needs more features to break tie) - represented as 0.5
        else:  # Later round (still needs more features ideally)
            prediction = 0.5 # Placeholder - Can't reliably predict with these features
    else: # Unofficial Judge
        prediction = 0.5 # Placeholder - Can't reliably predict with these features


    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Encoding:** The provided feature descriptions already include numerical encoding, which simplifies the code.

2. **Simplified Logic:** The decision tree structure is based on the simplified example from the previous response.  It checks for specific judges known (hypothetically) to favor one fighter or the other.

3. **Handling "Draw" and Uncertainty:**  Because we have limited features, we can't confidently predict many outcomes.  I use `0.5` as a placeholder for situations where the outcome is likely a draw or where more information is needed. In a real-world application, you might want to return a probability distribution over the classes (Lewis, Holyfield, Draw) instead of a single point prediction.

4. **Official vs. Unofficial Judges:** The tree gives more weight to official judges, assuming they are more reliable.

5. **Round Consideration:**  The tree includes a simple check for early rounds (<= 4), under the assumption that early rounds might be more cautious and result in more draws.

**Example Usage:**

```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 1}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [True, False, True, True]

X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 0, "Round": 10}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, True, False, False]

X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0.5
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [False, False, True, False]


```

**Further Improvements:**

* **Real-world Data:** With actual round-by-round scoring data from the Lewis vs. Holyfield fights, we could build a much more robust decision tree using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
* **More Features:**  Including features like punches landed, knockdowns, etc., would significantly improve the model's predictive power.
* **Probability Calibration:**  Instead of just predicting a single class, the model could output probabilities for each class (Lewis win, Holyfield win, Draw).


This improved example provides a more functional Python code structure and addresses the points about missing information and uncertainty. Remember that with the limited feature set, the predictive power will remain restricted.
