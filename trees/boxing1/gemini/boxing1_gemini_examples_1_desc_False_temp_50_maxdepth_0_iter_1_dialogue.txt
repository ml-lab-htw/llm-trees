def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize list to store truth values

    # Example thresholds - replace these with meaningful values learned from data 
    # if you have training data. These values are currently placeholders.
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is the judge official?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6     # Is the round in the later half of the fight?
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # Is the judge among the first three listed?

    if nodes[0]: # Official Judge
        if nodes[1]: # Later Round
            if nodes[2]: # Judge in first three
                prediction = 1  # Example: Lewis more likely to win later rounds according to official judges from the first group.
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Example: Holyfield might be favored by other judges in later rounds.
        else: # Earlier Round
            prediction = 0 # Example: Holyfield might be favored in earlier rounds generally.
    else: # Not Official Judge
        if nodes[2]: # Judge in first three
            prediction = 1 # Example: Even unofficial judges from the first group might favor Lewis
        else: 
            prediction = 0 # Example: Other unofficial judges might favor Holyfield


    return prediction, nodes # Return prediction and truth values of inner nodes

# Example usage (replace with your actual feature values):
example_features = {
    "Judge": 0, # E. Williams
    "Official": 1, # Yes, official judge
    "Round": 10 # Round 10
}

**Explanation and Crucial Next Steps:**

1. **Placeholders:** The current decision tree logic and thresholds are entirely placeholders.  Without data showing how judges scored and who actually won each round, it's impossible to create a meaningful tree.

2. **Data is Essential:** You *must* provide the dataset described in my previous response to build a useful decision tree.  The data needs to link judges' scores and official status to the round winner.

3. **Encoding:** The code uses numerical encoding for the categorical features ("Judge" and "Official") as you specified.

4. **Thresholds:** The thresholds in the `if` statements (e.g., `X["Round"] > 6`, `X["Judge"] in [0,1,2]`) are currently guesses. With real data, you'd use a decision tree learning algorithm (like those in scikit-learn) to determine the optimal thresholds and tree structure.

5. **Node Truth Values:** The `nodes` list stores the truth values (True/False, represented as 1/0) of the conditions at each inner node. This is returned along with the prediction.

6. **Scikit-learn:** Once you have the data, using scikit-learn is highly recommended. It automates the process of building decision trees (and other models) from data, including finding optimal thresholds and feature splits.  It will give you a much more accurate and reliable classifier than manually constructing a tree.
