```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 4
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 8

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Draw / toss-up in middle rounds (leaning towards Holyfield for simplicity)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Feature Names:** Uses the correct feature names ("Round", "Official", "Judge") as provided.  
* **Target Encoding:**  Returns 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield, as specified.
* **Threshold Values:**  Uses 4 and 8 as round thresholds, which makes sense in the context of a 12-round boxing match.
* **Simplified Logic:**  The nested `if` statements directly implement the decision tree logic.
* **No Unused Features:** "Judge" and "Official" aren't used in this simplified, depth-2 illustrative tree, as explained in the previous response.  A more complex tree or a different set of assumptions might incorporate them.
* **No Training Data Required:** This function directly encodes the decision tree logic without needing any training. (Remember, a real-world application would involve training on data.)


This function fulfills all the requirements of the prompt, including returning the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes (`nodes`). This list shows which branches of the tree were taken for a given input.  For example, if `Round` is 3, `nodes` will be `[True, True]`. If `Round` is 9, `nodes` will be `[False, False]`.  If `Round` is 6, `nodes` will be `[False, True]`.
