    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on features.

This code implements the decision tree logic described previously and includes example usage to demonstrate how the function works. The `nodes` list provides insight into which branches of the tree were taken during prediction.  Remember, this tree is based on simplified assumptions; real-world fight prediction would require more sophisticated features and a larger dataset.
