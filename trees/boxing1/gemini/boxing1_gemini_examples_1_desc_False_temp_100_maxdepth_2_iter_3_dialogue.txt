**Explanation and Important Notes:**

* **Placeholder Logic for Majority Vote:** The provided `X` dictionary only contains the judge's name, official status, and round number.  We *don't* have the actual scores for each judge. Therefore, the code uses placeholder logic (e.g., `X["Round"] <= 6`) to simulate a majority vote.  This is just for demonstration; in a real scenario, you'd replace this with the actual majority vote calculation based on the individual judge scores.

* **Focus on Structure:** The key aspect of this solution is the correct structure of the decision tree based on the specified depth and the prioritized use of the "Official" feature.  The placeholder logic for the majority vote can be easily replaced once you have the complete judging data.

* **How to Use:** You would call the `predict()` function with a dictionary `X` containing the features for a single round.  For example:

```python
X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis - based on placeholder logic)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") # Output: Nodes: [True, True]
```

Remember to replace the placeholder majority vote logic with the actual calculations when you have the full dataset. This structure provides a correct framework for the decision tree based on your specifications.
