```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judge = Yes
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Round <= 6

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge is Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1 # Lewis
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield
    else:  # Official Judge is No
        if X["Round"] <= 4:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0 # Holyfield


    return prediction, nodes
```


**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Feature Access:** The code now correctly accesses features using the provided keys  `'Official'` and `'Round'`.
* **Thresholds:**  Reasonable threshold values (6 for the official judges' round split and 4 for the unofficial judges' round split) are included, based on the earlier hypothetical scenario.  These would need to be adjusted based on real data.
* **Target Encoding:** The `prediction` is now encoded as 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield, consistent with the provided target variable encoding.
* **Simplified Logic:** The nested `if` statements are streamlined to match the decision tree logic directly.



**Example Usage:**

```python
example_round1 = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 1}
prediction1, nodes1 = predict(example_round1)
print(f"Prediction for round 1: {prediction1} (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield), Nodes: {nodes1}")

example_round8 = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 8}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(example_round8)
print(f"Prediction for round 8: {prediction2} (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield), Nodes: {nodes2}")


example_round3_unofficial = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 3}
prediction3, nodes3 = predict(example_round3_unofficial)
print(f"Prediction for round 3 (unofficial): {prediction3} (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield), Nodes: {nodes3}")

example_round10_unofficial = {'Judge': 4, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 10}
prediction4, nodes4 = predict(example_round10_unofficial)
print(f"Prediction for round 10 (unofficial): {prediction4} (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield), Nodes: {nodes4}")

```


This revised code provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree, taking a dictionary of features as input and returning the prediction along with the truth values of the inner nodes. Remember that to get a truly accurate decision tree, you'd need to train it on real fight data.  This example is a good starting point for understanding how to structure such a function.
