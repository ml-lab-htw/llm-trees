I understand! You want a Python function representing a decision tree that predicts the winner of a boxing round based on the given features.  Since I don't have the actual data to train a decision tree and determine meaningful thresholds, I'll create an example function with a plausible decision tree structure. 

**Remember:** The thresholds and tree structure below are for demonstration purposes only, as I have not performed actual training on your boxing data.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of input features:
            - 'Judge': Judge (0-9)
            - 'Official': Official judge (1=Yes, 0=No)
            - 'Round': Round number (1-12)

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes) 
            - prediction (int): Predicted winner (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield)
            - nodes (list): Truth values of inner nodes (1=True, 0=False)
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None] 

    # Example Decision Tree Structure (adjust thresholds based on data)
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] <= 3  # Is the judge among the first few listed?
    nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] > 6  # Is it a later round in the fight?

    if nodes[0]: 
        if nodes[1]: 
            prediction = 1  # Lewis more likely to win if early round & official judge
        else:  
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield might have edge if not official, early round
    else:  # Judges later in the list
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield might be favored in later rounds by these judges
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis might have edge in earlier rounds

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_round = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield)")
print(f"Nodes (Truth Values): {nodes}") 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`predict(X)` function:** Takes a dictionary `X` containing the features of a boxing round.
2. **`nodes` list:** Stores the truth values (True/False or 1/0) of the conditions checked at each internal node of the decision tree.
3. **Decision Tree Logic:**  
   - The example tree first checks the 'Judge'. If it's among the first few (assuming those judges might favor Lewis), it goes down one branch. Otherwise, it goes down the other.
   - Each branch then considers 'Official' and 'Round' to make a final prediction. 
4. **Thresholds:**  The thresholds used in the example (e.g., `Judge <= 3`, `Round > 6`) are placeholders. You need to analyze your data to find meaningful thresholds that split the data effectively.
5. **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to call the function with a sample round and interpret the output.

**To make this decision tree actually work with your data, you need to:**

- **Train the Model:** Use a decision tree learning algorithm (like ID3, C4.5, or CART) along with your labeled boxing dataset. This will automatically determine the best tree structure, features to use at each node, and the optimal threshold values. 
- **Evaluate Performance:**  After training, test the decision tree on unseen data to measure its accuracy and how well it generalizes.

Once you have a trained decision tree model, you can adapt the code structure of this example function to create a prediction function that uses the learned rules.
