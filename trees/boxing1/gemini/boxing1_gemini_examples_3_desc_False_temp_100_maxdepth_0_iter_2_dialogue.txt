I understand now. You want a Python function that simulates a decision tree based on boxing judges, but you haven't provided the actual decision tree logic. You've given examples from an unrelated Iris dataset.

Since you haven't trained a decision tree on your boxing data, I'll create a plausible function with placeholder thresholds. **You'll need to replace these placeholders with values learned from your actual dataset and model.**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round based on judge scores.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary of features for a single round.
            - 'Judge': Judge ID (0-9).
            - 'Official': 1 if official judge, 0 otherwise.
            - 'Round': Round number (1-12).

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
            - prediction (int): Predicted winner (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
            - nodes (list): List of boolean values representing the truth values
                            of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
    """

    nodes = 3 * [None]

    # Example logic (replace with your actual thresholds)
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Is the judge official?
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] in [2, 5, 8]  # Is the judge among a specific group?
    nodes[2] = X['Round'] > 6  # Is it a later round?

    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is official
        if nodes[1]:  # ...and is in the specific group
            prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0  # Lewis likely wins later rounds
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield more likely otherwise
    else:  # Unofficial judges less reliable
        prediction = 1 if nodes[2] else 0  # Simple round-based guess

    return prediction, nodes

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Placeholders:** The thresholds in this function (e.g., specific judge IDs, round number) are placeholders. You **must** replace them with values that make sense based on the patterns you find in your boxing data.

2. **Decision Logic:** The `if/else` statements represent the decision nodes in your tree. The logic here is simplified and should be adjusted based on your data analysis and model training.

3. **`nodes` List:** This list stores whether each decision node's condition was met (True/1) or not (False/0). This helps you understand the path taken through the tree for a given input.

**To use this function:**

```python
example_round = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 9}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_round)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} (Lewis=1, Holyfield=0)")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}") 
```

**Remember:** This is a starting point.  You need to train a decision tree model on your actual boxing data to get meaningful thresholds and decision logic.
