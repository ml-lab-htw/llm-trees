Explanation of the generated decision tree logic:

The generated function implements a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4, using the provided features (Judge, Official, Round) to predict the target variable (who won the round).  The conditions in the tree are arbitrarily chosen to demonstrate the structure, but I tried to make them somewhat plausible within the context of a boxing match:

1. **Judge <= 4:**  Splits the judges into two primary groups.  The idea is that perhaps some judges tend to favor one boxer slightly more than others.

2. **Round > 6:** Splits the rounds into "early" and "late."  The assumption is that the dynamics of the fight might change as it progresses.

3. **Official == 1:** Considers whether the judge is an "official" judge. The intuition being that official judges might be more impartial or consistent.

4. **Judge > 1:**  Further divides the first group of judges (0-4).

The prediction at each leaf node is also arbitrarily assigned (0 or 1) but tries to be loosely consistent with the created splits.  Remember that this decision tree is *not* trained on any actual boxing data, so the logic is for demonstration purposes only.  A real decision tree would learn these splits and predictions based on training data.



The `nodes` list keeps track of the truth values of each inner node's condition, providing insights into the path taken during prediction.  This list is crucial for interpretability and understanding how the tree arrives at its final prediction.
