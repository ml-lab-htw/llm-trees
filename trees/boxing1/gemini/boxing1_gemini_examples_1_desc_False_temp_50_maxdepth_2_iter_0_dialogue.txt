    Args:

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list of

Key Improvements:

* **Clearer Logic:** The code now directly reflects the decision tree logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.
* **Specific Thresholds:**  The placeholder thresholds have been replaced with 6 for the round split and 3 (HBO-Lederman) for the unofficial judge example.
* **Encoding Handling:** The code uses the provided feature encoding (e.g., 1 for "Yes" in "Official").
* **Example Usage:**  The included examples demonstrate how to use the function and interpret the output.
* **Docstring:**  A docstring has been added to explain the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.



This improved version provides a functional Python implementation of the decision tree, handling the feature encoding and producing both the prediction and the inner node truth values. Remember, the actual effectiveness of this tree depends on having real-world data to train it properly and potentially adjust the thresholds or structure.
