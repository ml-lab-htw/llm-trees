Certainly! Below is the Python function `predict` that represents the decision tree classifier you've requested. This function:

- **Accepts** a dictionary `X` containing the features with exact keys as specified: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.
- **Returns**:
  - A single prediction indicating which boxer won the round (`1` for **Lewis**, `0` for **Holyfield**).
  - A list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes (conditions), where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

The decision tree has a **maximum depth of 3** and utilizes meaningful thresholds based on the features provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3

    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Is the round less than or equal to 6?
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is the judge E. Williams?
            nodes[2] = 1 if X["Judge"] == 0 else 0  # 0 = E. Williams
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            # Node 2: Is the round less than or equal to 9?
            nodes[2] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 9 else 0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        # Node 1: Is the judge in [HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, ESPN]?
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["Judge"] in [3, 7, 8] else 0
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is the round less than or equal to 9?
            nodes[2] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 9 else 0
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            # Node 2: No further condition
            nodes[2] = 0  # Condition not satisfied
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Decision Tree Structure**:

```
|--- Official == 1 (Yes)
|    |--- Round <= 6
|    |    |--- Judge == 0 (E. Williams)
|    |    |    |--- Prediction: Holyfield (0)
|    |    |--- Judge != 0
|    |    |    |--- Prediction: Lewis (1)
|    |--- Round > 6
|    |    |--- Round <= 9
|    |    |    |--- Prediction: Lewis (1)
|    |    |--- Round > 9
|    |    |    |--- Prediction: Holyfield (0)
|--- Official == 0 (No)
|    |--- Judge in [3, 7, 8] (HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, ESPN)
|    |    |--- Round <= 9
|    |    |    |--- Prediction: Lewis (1)
|    |    |--- Round > 9
|    |    |    |--- Prediction: Holyfield (0)
|    |--- Judge not in [3, 7, 8]
|    |    |--- Prediction: Holyfield (0)
```

**Feature Encodings**:

- **Judge**:
  - `0`: E. Williams
  - `1`: L. O'Connell
  - `2`: S. Christodoulu
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Boxing Times
  - `6`: Sportsline
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: ESPN
  - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach
- **Official**:
  - `1`: Yes
  - `0`: No
- **Round**:
  - `1` to `12` (Integer values)

**Target Variable**:

- **Prediction**:
  - `1`: Lewis wins the round
  - `0`: Holyfield wins the round

**Explanation of the Function**:

1. **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`):
   - Checks if the judge is an **official judge** (`Official` == `1`).
   - **Result**: `1` if official, `0` if not.

2. **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`):
   - **If official** (`nodes[0]` == `1`):
     - Checks if the **round** is less than or equal to `6` (`Round` <= `6`).
   - **If unofficial** (`nodes[0]` == `0`):
     - Checks if the **judge** is one of `[3, 7, 8]` (HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, ESPN).

3. **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`):
   - **Official judges, Round <= 6**:
     - Checks if the **judge** is `0` (E. Williams).
   - **Official judges, Round > 6**:
     - Checks if the **round** is less than or equal to `9` (`Round` <= `9`).
   - **Unofficial judges, favored media**:
     - Checks if the **round** is less than or equal to `9` (`Round` <= `9`).
   - **Other cases**:
     - No further condition; set `nodes[2]` to `0`.

4. **Predictions**:
   - Based on the evaluations of the nodes, the function assigns the prediction according to the tree structure.

**Example Usage**:

- **Input**:
  ```python
  X = {
      "Judge": 0,        # E. Williams
      "Official": 1,     # Yes
      "Round": 5
  }
  ```
- **Function Call**:
  ```python
  prediction, nodes = predict(X)
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```python
  prediction = 0       # Holyfield wins the round
  nodes = [1, 1, 1]    # All conditions satisfied
  ```

**Explanation**:

- **Node 0**: `Official` == `1` ⇒ `nodes[0] = 1`.
- **Node 1**: `Round` <= `6` ⇒ `nodes[1] = 1`.
- **Node 2**: `Judge` == `0` ⇒ `nodes[2] = 1`.
- **Prediction**: Holyfield (`0`).

**Notes**:

- The function strictly follows the specified feature keys and encodings.
- It fills meaningful thresholds based on the fight dynamics and judges' tendencies.
- The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were met during prediction.

**Conclusion**:

- This function allows you to input the features of a particular round and receive both the predicted winner and a breakdown of the decision-making process via the `nodes` list.
- It adheres to a maximum depth of 3, providing a balance between complexity and interpretability.
