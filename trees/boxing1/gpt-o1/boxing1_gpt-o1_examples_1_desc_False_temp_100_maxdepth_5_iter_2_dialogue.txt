**Explanation:**

- **Nodes Initialization:** We initialize a list `nodes` with 5 `None` elements, corresponding to the maximum depth of the tree.
- **Node 0:** Checks if `Official` judge is `yes` (1).
  - If **yes** (`nodes[0] = 1`):
    - **Node 1:** Checks if `Round` is less than or equal to 6.
      - If **yes** (`nodes[1] = 1`), predicts `0` (Holyfield wins).
      - If **no** (`nodes[1] = 0`), predicts `1` (Lewis wins).
    - Nodes 2, 3, and 4 are not used in this path (`nodes[2] = nodes[3] = nodes[4] = 0`).
  - If **no** (`nodes[0] = 0`):
    - **Node 2:** Checks if `Judge` is in the list `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` (judges favoring Lewis).
      - If **yes** (`nodes[2] = 1`), predicts `1` (Lewis wins).
      - If **no** (`nodes[2] = 0`):
        - **Node 3:** Checks if `Judge` is in the list `[0, 1, 2]` (judges favoring Holyfield).
          - If **yes** (`nodes[3] = 1`), predicts `0` (Holyfield wins).
          - If **no** (`nodes[3] = 0`):
            - **Node 4:** Default case when `Judge` is not in any known group.
              - Sets `nodes[4] = 1` (condition satisfied).
              - Predicts `0` (defaults to Holyfield).
- **Nodes List:** Converts all `None` values in `nodes` to `0` for consistency in the output list.
- **Return:** The function returns the `prediction` (0 or 1) and the list of node truth values `nodes`.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X = {
    'Judge': 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,    # Not an official judge
    'Round': 7
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
```

**Explanation of Output:**

- `nodes[0] = 0`: `Official` judge is not `yes`.
- `nodes[2] = 1`: `Judge` is in `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` (judges favoring Lewis).
- Prediction is `1`, so Lewis wins according to this decision tree.
