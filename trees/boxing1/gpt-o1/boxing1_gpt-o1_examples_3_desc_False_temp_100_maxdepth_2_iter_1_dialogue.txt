Certainly! Based on your request, I will format the decision tree as a Python function that:

- Returns a single prediction (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield).
- Returns a list (`nodes`) representing the truth values of the inner nodes, where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.
- Uses the exact keys of the features: `['Judge', 'Official', 'Round']`.
- Fills any placeholders with meaningful values.

**Features and Encodings**:

- **Judge**:
  - `0` = E. Williams
  - `1` = L. O'Connell
  - `2` = S. Christodoulu
  - `3` = HBO-Lederman
  - `4` = Sportsticker
  - `5` = Boxing Times
  - `6` = Sportsline
  - `7` = Associated Press
  - `8` = ESPN
  - `9` = Boxing Monthly-Leach
- **Official**:
  - `1` = Yes
  - `0` = No
- **Round**:
  - Ranges from `1` to `12`

**Target Variable**:

- **Winner**:
  - `1` = Lewis
  - `0` = Holyfield

**Decision Tree Explanation**:

We will build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 to predict the winner of a boxing round based on the features provided. The decision tree is as follows:

```
|--- Official == 1
|    |--- Predict: Holyfield (0)
|--- Official == 0
|    |--- Judge >= 6
|         |--- Predict: Lewis (1)
|    |--- Judge < 6
|         |--- Predict: Holyfield (0)
```

- **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is an official judge.
  - If **Yes** (`Official == 1`), predicts **Holyfield** (`0`).
  - If **No** (`Official == 0`), moves to the next node.
- **Node 1**: For unofficial judges (`Official == 0`), checks if the judge's index is greater than or equal to `6`.
  - Judges with indices `6`, `7`, `8`, `9` tend to favor **Lewis**.
  - Judges with indices `3`, `4`, `5` tend to favor **Holyfield**.
  - If `Judge >= 6`, predicts **Lewis** (`1`).
  - If `Judge < 6`, predicts **Holyfield** (`0`).

**Python Function**:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # Node 0: Checks if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        # If Official judge, predict Holyfield (0)
        prediction = 0
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated
    else:
        # Node 1: For unofficial judges, check if Judge >= 6
        nodes[1] = 1 if X["Judge"] >= 6 else 0
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            # If Judge >= 6, predict Lewis (1)
            prediction = 1
        else:
            # If Judge < 6, predict Holyfield (0)
            prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Example Usage**:

Let's test the function with some examples.

1. **Official Judge (E. Williams), Round 5**:
   ```python
   X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
   ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Prediction: 0, Nodes: [1, None]
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `nodes[0] = 1` (Official judge)
     - Prediction: Holyfield (`0`)

2. **Unofficial Judge (ESPN), Round 8**:
   ```python
   X = {"Judge": 8, "Official": 0, "Round": 8}
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
   ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Prediction: 1, Nodes: [0, 1]
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `nodes[0] = 0` (Unofficial judge)
     - `nodes[1] = 1` (`Judge >= 6`)
     - Prediction: Lewis (`1`)

3. **Unofficial Judge (Boxing Times), Round 3**:
   ```python
   X = {"Judge": 5, "Official": 0, "Round": 3}
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
   ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0, 0]
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `nodes[0] = 0` (Unofficial judge)
     - `nodes[1] = 0` (`Judge < 6`)
     - Prediction: Holyfield (`0`)

**Note**:

- The `nodes` list contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `nodes[0]`: `1` if `Official == 1`, else `0`.
  - `nodes[1]`: `1` if `Judge >= 6` (evaluated only if `nodes[0] == 0`), else `0`.

- The function strictly uses the feature keys and encodings as provided.

- Thresholds (`Judge >= 6`) are chosen based on the assumption that judges with indices `6` to `9` favor Lewis, while those with indices `3` to `5` favor Holyfield.

**Summary**:

This function implements the decision tree classifier as per your requirements, using the most important features to predict the winner of each round between Lewis and Holyfield.
