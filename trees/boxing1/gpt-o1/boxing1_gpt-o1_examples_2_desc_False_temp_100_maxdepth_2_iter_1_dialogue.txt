Sure, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Prediction: Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Prediction: Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Prediction: Holyfield

    # Convert boolean values to integers (1 if True, 0 if False)
    nodes = [1 if node else 0 for node in nodes]

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - **"Judge"**: Encoded as specified (e.g., 0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, ..., 3 = HBO-Lederman, etc.).
  - **"Official"**: Encoded as 1 = Yes, 0 = No.
  - **"Round"**: Not used in this tree but ranges from 1 to 12.

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  - **Node 0** (Depth 1):
    - Checks if the judge is an **Official** judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
    - If **True** (`nodes[0]` is `1`), predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Node 1** (Depth 2):
    - If the judge is not official (`nodes[0]` is `0`), check if the **Judge** is **HBO-Lederman** (`X["Judge"] == 3`).
    - If **True** (`nodes[1]` is `1`), predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).
    - If **False** (`nodes[1]` is `0`), predict **Holyfield** (`prediction = 0`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - Contains the truth values of the inner nodes:
    - `nodes[0]`: `1` if `X["Official"] == 1`, else `0`.
    - `nodes[1]`: `1` if `X["Judge"] == 3`, else `0`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is official
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,       # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [1, 0]
```

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the specified feature keys and encodings.
- The returned `prediction` is `1` for **Lewis** and `0` for **Holyfield**, matching the target variable encoding.
- The `nodes` list helps trace the path taken in the decision tree:
  - A `1` indicates the condition at that node was satisfied.
  - A `0` indicates the condition was not satisfied.

**Thresholds and Conditions:**

- **Thresholds are filled with meaningful values based on feature encodings:**
  - `X["Official"] == 1` checks if the judge is official.
  - `X["Judge"] == 3` checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman.

Feel free to test the function with different feature inputs to see how the prediction and nodes change.
