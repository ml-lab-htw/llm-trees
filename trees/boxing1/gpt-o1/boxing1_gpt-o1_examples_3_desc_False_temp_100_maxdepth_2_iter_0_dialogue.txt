Sure! Based on the given features and target variable, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree with a maximum depth of 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)  # Checks if Official judge is 'Yes'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = int(X["Judge"] == 0)  # Checks if Judge is 'E. Williams'
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0:** Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` equals 1 for 'Yes'). If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), we proceed to Node 1; otherwise, we predict that Lewis wins the round.
  
- **Node 1:** Within the official judges, checks if the judge is E. Williams (`Judge` equals 0). If this condition is satisfied (`nodes[1] = 1`), we predict that Holyfield wins the round; otherwise, we predict that Lewis wins the round.

**Notes:**

- **Feature Keys:**
  - `"Judge"`: Encoded as:
    - `0`: E. Williams
    - `1`: L. O'Connell
    - `2`: S. Christodoulu
    - `3`: HBO-Lederman
    - `4`: Sportsticker
    - `5`: Boxing Times
    - `6`: Sportsline
    - `7`: Associated Press
    - `8`: ESPN
    - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - `"Official"`:
    - `1`: Yes
    - `0`: No
  - `"Round"`: Integer from `1` to `12` (not used in this tree)

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `1`: Lewis wins the round
  - `0`: Holyfield wins the round

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `Official == 1` (1 if True, 0 if False).
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents the truth value of the condition `Judge == 0` within the official judges.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where Official judge is 'Yes' and Judge is 'E. Williams'
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,        # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,     # Yes
    "Round": 5         # Any round between 1 and 12
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Holyfield
Nodes Truth Values: [1, 1]
```

- **Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: The judge is an official judge.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: The judge is E. Williams.
  - Since both conditions are satisfied, the prediction is that **Holyfield** wins the round.

Feel free to use this function with different input values to see how the prediction and nodes' truth values change!
