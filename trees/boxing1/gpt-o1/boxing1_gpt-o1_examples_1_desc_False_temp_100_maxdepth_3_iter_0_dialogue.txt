Certainly! Here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. This function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with keys matching the exact feature names you provided, and returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 2  # Initialize a list to hold truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge (Official == 1)
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)

    if nodes[0]:  # If Official == 1 (Yes)
        # Node 1: Check if the Round is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)

        if nodes[1]:  # If Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:         # If Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:           # If Official == 0 (No)
        nodes[1] = 0  # Node 1 condition is not evaluated, set to 0
        prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Inputs:**
  - `X`: A dictionary with the following keys:
    - `'Judge'`: (0 to 9)
    - `'Official'`: (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
    - `'Round'`: (1 to 12)

- **Outputs:**
  - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
  - `nodes`: A list containing the truth values (1 or 0) of the inner nodes:
    - `nodes[0]`: Whether the judge is an official judge.
    - `nodes[1]`: Whether the round number is less than or equal to 6 (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `1`).

**Decision Logic:**

1. **Node 0:** Check if the judge is an official judge.
   - `nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)`
     - If `X['Official']` is `1` (Yes), `nodes[0]` is `1`.
     - If `X['Official']` is `0` (No), `nodes[0]` is `0`.

2. **Node 1:** If the judge is official (`nodes[0] == 1`), check if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
   - `nodes[1] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)`
     - If `X['Round']` is less than or equal to `6`, `nodes[1]` is `1`.
     - If `X['Round']` is greater than `6`, `nodes[1]` is `0`.
   - **Prediction:**
     - If `nodes[1] == 1` (Round <= 6), predict `0` (Holyfield wins).
     - If `nodes[1] == 0` (Round > 6), predict `1` (Lewis wins).

3. **Else:** If the judge is not official (`nodes[0] == 0`), predict `1` (Lewis wins).
   - `nodes[1]` is set to `0` since it's not evaluated in this branch.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is official, and it's round 5
X_example = {
    'Judge': 1,       # L. O'Connell
    'Official': 1,    # Yes
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f'Prediction: {prediction} ({"Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield"})')
print(f'Inner Nodes Truth Values: {nodes}')
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
Inner Nodes Truth Values: [1, 1]
```

**Feature Encoding Reminder:**

- **Judge:**
  - `0` = E. Williams
  - `1` = L. O'Connell
  - `2` = S. Christodoulou
  - `3` = HBO-Lederman
  - `4` = Sportsticker
  - `5` = Boxing Times
  - `6` = Sportsline
  - `7` = Associated Press
  - `8` = ESPN
  - `9` = Boxing Monthly-Leach

- **Official:**
  - `1` = Yes
  - `0` = No

- **Round:**
  - `1` to `12`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `1` = Lewis wins the round
- `0` = Holyfield wins the round

**Summary:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier you requested, using the most important features with a maximum depth of 3. It evaluates whether the judge is official and the round number to predict the winner of each round between Lewis and Holyfield. The `nodes` list provides a trace of the decision-making process, indicating which conditions were satisfied during prediction.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs to see how it predicts the outcomes based on the provided features.
