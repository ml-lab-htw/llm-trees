Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features you've provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with keys matching the exact feature names and returns the prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 0 else 0   # Official judge: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0      # Round number comparison

    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 0 condition is satisfied: Official judge = No
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        # Node 0 condition is not satisfied: Official judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 1 condition is satisfied: Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
        else:
            # Node 1 condition is not satisfied: Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]** checks if the judge is **not an official judge** (`Official` is 0).
  - `nodes[0] = 1` if `Official == 0` (Unofficial judge)
  - This captures that unofficial judges tended to score in favor of **Lewis**.

- **nodes[1]** checks if the **Round number is less than or equal to 6**.
  - `nodes[1] = 1` if `Round <= 6`
  - This reflects that in the first half of the fight, official judges were more inclined to score rounds for **Holyfield**.

**Feature Encodings and Exact Keys:**

- **Judge**: Judge identifier (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
- **Official**: Official judge status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: Round number (1 to 12)

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **target**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have a round scored by an unofficial judge in round 5.

```python
X_sample = {
    "Judge": 4,        # Sportsticker
    "Official": 0,     # Unofficial judge
    "Round": 5         # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction:", "Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

- **Nodes Interpretation:**
  - `nodes[0] = 1`: The judge is unofficial.
  - `nodes[1] = 1`: The round is in the first half (Round <= 6).

Since `nodes[0]` is `1`, the function predicts **Lewis** as the winner of the round.

**Note:** Make sure that the input dictionary `X` uses the exact keys and encodings as specified to ensure accurate predictions.
