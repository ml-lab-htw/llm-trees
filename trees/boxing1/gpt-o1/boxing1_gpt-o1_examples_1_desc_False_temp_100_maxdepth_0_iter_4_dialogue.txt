**Explanation:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier based on the provided features:

- **Features:**
  - `"Judge"`: Encoded as integers from 0 to 9.
  - `"Official"`: Encoded as 1 (Yes) and 0 (No).
  - `"Round"`: Integer from 1 to 12.

- **Target Variable:**
  - `1` for **Lewis** winning the round.
  - `0` for **Holyfield** winning the round.

**Decision Tree Structure:**

1. **Node 0:** Check if the judge is **not** official (`X["Official"] <= 0`).
   - If **True** (`nodes[0] = True`):
     - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).
   - If **False** (`nodes[0] = False`):
     - Proceed to Node 1.

2. **Node 1:** Check if the judge is **S. Christodoulu** (`X["Judge"] == 2`).
   - If **True** (`nodes[1] = True`):
     - Predict **Holyfield** (`prediction = 0`).
   - If **False** (`nodes[1] = False`):
     - Proceed to Node 2.

3. **Node 2:** Check if the judge is **L. O'Connell** (`X["Judge"] == 1`).
   - If **True** (`nodes[2] = True`):
     - Proceed to Node 3.
   - If **False** (`nodes[2] = False`):
     - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).

4. **Node 3:** Check if the **Round** is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`).
   - If **True** (`nodes[3] = True`):
     - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).
   - If **False** (`nodes[3] = False`):
     - Predict **Holyfield** (`prediction = 0`).

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    "Judge": 1,       # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 8        # Round 8
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print(f"Decision Path: {nodes}")    # Output: Decision Path: [False, False, True, False]
```

**Interpreting the Output:**

- **Prediction:** The predicted winner of the round.
  - `1` for **Lewis**.
  - `0` for **Holyfield**.

- **Decision Path (`nodes` list):**
  - Each element corresponds to the truth value of a decision node.
  - `True` means the condition at that node is satisfied.
  - `False` means the condition is not satisfied.

**Important Notes:**

- The function strictly uses the provided feature names and encoding.
- The decision tree is constructed hypothetically and is not based on actual training data.
- Thresholds and conditions are chosen to make logical sense based on the given descriptions.
- The `nodes` list helps trace the path taken in the tree to reach the prediction.
