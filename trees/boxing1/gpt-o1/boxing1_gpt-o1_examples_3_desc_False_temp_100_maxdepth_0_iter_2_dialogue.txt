Certainly! Based on the features you've provided and the encoding specified, here's the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier. The function returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. 

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)        # Node 0: Is the judge official?
    nodes[1] = int(X["Judge"] == 0)           # Node 1: Is the judge E. Williams? (0 = E. Williams)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Round"] <= 6)           # Node 2: Is the round number less than or equal to 6?
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Official judge is Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # If Judge is E. Williams
            prediction = 0  # Winner: Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round is less than or equal to 6
                prediction = 1  # Winner: Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Winner: Holyfield
    else:  # If Official judge is No
        prediction = 1  # Winner: Lewis
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` feature).
  - `nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)`
- **nodes[1]:** Checks if the judge is E. Williams (`Judge` feature where 0 = E. Williams).
  - `nodes[1] = int(X["Judge"] == 0)`
- **nodes[2]:** Checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (`Round` feature).
  - `nodes[2] = int(X["Round"] <= 6)`

**Decision Logic:**

- **If** the judge is an official judge (`nodes[0] == 1`):
  - **If** the judge is E. Williams (`nodes[1] == 1`):
    - **Prediction:** Holyfield wins (`prediction = 0`).
    - **Reasoning:** Judge E. Williams favored Holyfield.
  - **Else:**
    - **If** the round is in the first half (`nodes[2] == 1`):
      - **Prediction:** Lewis wins (`prediction = 1`).
      - **Reasoning:** Other official judges favored Lewis in early rounds.
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** Holyfield wins (`prediction = 0`).
      - **Reasoning:** Holyfield performed better in later rounds according to some judges.
- **Else** (judge is unofficial, `nodes[0] == 0`):
  - **Prediction:** Lewis wins (`prediction = 1`).
  - **Reasoning:** Most unofficial judges scored in favor of Lewis.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following features for a round:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 2,      # S. Christodoulu
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 5
}
```

Predicting the outcome:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield")
print("Nodes truth values:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes truth values: [1, 0, 1]
```

**Note on Thresholds:**

- The threshold for the `Round` feature is set at 6, dividing the fight into two halves.
- This is meaningful because the dynamics of a boxing match can change between early and late rounds.

**Feature Keys and Encodings:**

- **Judge:**
  - `0 = E. Williams`, `1 = L. O'Connell`, `2 = S. Christodoulu`, `3 = HBO-Lederman`, `4 = Sportsticker`, `5 = Boxing Times`, `6 = Sportsline`, `7 = Associated Press`, `8 = ESPN`, `9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach`
- **Official:**
  - `1 = Yes`, `0 = No`
- **Round:**
  - `1` to `12`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0` = **Holyfield**
- `1` = **Lewis**
