Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the exact feature keys and target variable encoding provided, here is the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 1  # List to store the truth values of inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Feature Keys (exact spelling):**
  - `'Judge'`: Judge (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
  - `'Official'`: Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - `'Round'`: Round number (1 to 12)

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `0`: Holyfield wins the round
  - `1`: Lewis wins the round

- **Function Details:**
  - The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features with exact keys.
  - `nodes` is a list that will store the truth values (1 or 0) of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
  - **Node 0 Condition:** `X["Official"] == 1`
    - If `Official` is `1` (Yes), the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`).
    - If `Official` is `0` (No), the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] = 0`).
  - **Prediction:**
    - If `nodes[0]` is `1` (the judge is official), predict `0` (Holyfield wins).
    - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (the judge is not official), predict `1` (Lewis wins).

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is an official judge
X_example_official = {
    'Judge': 0,     # E. Williams
    'Official': 1,  # Yes
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example_official)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [1]

# Example input where the judge is not an official judge
X_example_unofficial = {
    'Judge': 4,     # Sportsticker
    'Official': 0,  # No
    'Round': 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example_unofficial)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: Nodes: [0]
```

This function reflects the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 using the most important feature (`'Official'`) to classify the winner of each round.
