Sure! Based on the features provided and the requirement to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, here's the Python function that predicts which fighter (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Decision Tree:**

```
|--- Official == 1
|    |--- class: Holyfield (0)
|--- Official != 1
|    |--- Round <= 6
|        |--- class: Lewis (1)
|    |--- Round > 6
|        |--- class: Holyfield (0)
```

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Official judge
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        nodes[1] = None  # No further split
    else:
        # Unofficial judge
        nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).
  - `nodes[1]` checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (`Round <= 6`), but only if the judge is not official.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If `Official == 1`:**
    - **Prediction:** `0` (Holyfield)
  - **Else (Unofficial judge):**
    - **If `Round <= 6`:**
      - **Prediction:** `1` (Lewis)
    - **Else:**
      - **Prediction:** `0` (Holyfield)

This decision tree captures the tendency that official judges favored Holyfield throughout the fight, while unofficial judges favored Lewis in the earlier rounds but leaned towards Holyfield in the later rounds.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
# Example input data
X = {
    'Judge': 3,      # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,   # No
    'Round': 5       # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")         # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")                   # Output: Nodes: [False, True]
```

**Interpretation:**

- `nodes[0] = False` because `Official` is `0` (No).
- `nodes[1] = True` because `Round` is `5`, which is less than or equal to `6`.
- The function predicts `1`, which corresponds to **Lewis** winning the round.

**Feature Details:**

- **Judge:** 
  - `0`: E. Williams
  - `1`: L. O'Connell
  - `2`: S. Christodoulou
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Boxing Times
  - `6`: Sportsline
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: ESPN
  - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach

- **Official:** 
  - `1`: Yes
  - `0`: No

- **Round:** 
  - Ranges from `1` to `12`.

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `0`: Holyfield
- `1`: Lewis
