Certainly! Based on the features provided and aiming to build a decision tree of maximum depth 2, here's a Python function that represents the decision tree classifier. The function returns a single prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Decision Tree Description:**

- **Node 0:** Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
  - **If True:** Predict **Lewis** as the winner.
  - **If False:** Proceed to Node 1.
- **Node 1:** Check if the judge is an official judge (`Official` == 1).
  - **If True:** Predict **Holyfield** as the winner.
  - **If False:** Predict **Lewis** as the winner.

Here's the Python function formatted as per your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    nodes[0] = X['Round'] <= 6
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
        nodes[1] = None  # Node not evaluated
    else:
        nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **nodes[0]:** Evaluates whether the `Round` is less than or equal to 6.
  - If `True`, it predicts **Lewis** (1) as the winner and does not evaluate further nodes.
  - If `False`, it proceeds to evaluate `nodes[1]`.
- **nodes[1]:** Evaluates whether the judge is an official judge (`Official` == 1).
  - If `True`, it predicts **Holyfield** (0) as the winner.
  - If `False`, it predicts **Lewis** (1) as the winner.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input features for a round:

```python
X = {
    'Judge': 1,       # L. O'Connell (official judge)
    'Official': 1,    # Yes
    'Round': 8        # Round 8
}
```

Using the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Node evaluations: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Holyfield
Node evaluations: [False, True]
```

This means that for Round 8, judged by an official judge, the model predicts **Holyfield** as the winner.

**Notes:**

- The **thresholds** used are meaningful values based on the described features:
  - **Round <= 6:** Divides the fight into early rounds (1-6) and later rounds (7-12).
  - **Official == 1:** Checks if the judge is one of the official judges.
- The **nodes list** contains boolean values corresponding to the truth value of each condition:
  - `nodes[0]`: Result of `X['Round'] <= 6`
  - `nodes[1]`: Result of `X['Official'] == 1` (only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`)
- If a node is **not evaluated** (because the previous condition was sufficient for the prediction), it is set to `None` in the `nodes` list.

This function adheres to the format you've specified and utilizes the most significant features to predict the winner of each round between Lewis and Holyfield.
