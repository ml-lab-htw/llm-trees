```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list to store truth values for inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # 1 = Yes, 0 = No
    
    # Node 1: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6.5
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5  # Round ranges from 1 to 12
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Official judge is yes
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (1 = Lewis)
    else:
        # If Official judge is no
        if nodes[1]:
            # If Round is less than or equal to 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins (0 = Holyfield)
        else:
            # If Round is greater than 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (1 = Lewis)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Official"`: Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
  - `"Round"`: The round number (1 to 12).

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.5.

- **Decision Logic:**
  1. **Node 0:**
     - If the judge is an official judge (`nodes[0]` is `True`), predict **Lewis** as the winner (`prediction = 1`).
  2. **Else:**
     - **Node 1:**
       - If the round number is less than or equal to 6.5 (`nodes[1]` is `True`), predict **Holyfield** as the winner (`prediction = 0`).
       - Else, predict **Lewis** as the winner (`prediction = 1`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input data:

```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # No
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Holyfield
Nodes: [False, True]
```

- `nodes[0]` is `False` because `Official` is `0` (No).
- `nodes[1]` is `True` because `Round` is `5` (which is â‰¤ 6.5).
- Therefore, the model predicts **Holyfield** as the winner for this round.

**Note:**

- Ensure that the input dictionary `X` contains the keys `"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"` with the correct encoding as specified.
- The thresholds and values used in the conditions are based on the most significant features and splits from the decision tree.

**Feature Encodings:**

- **Judge:**
  - `0`: E. Williams
  - `1`: L. O'Connell
  - `2`: S. Christodoulu
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Boxing Times
  - `6`: Sportsline
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: ESPN
  - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach
- **Official:**
  - `1`: Yes
  - `0`: No
- **Round:**
  - Integer values from `1` to `12`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `1`: Lewis wins the round
- `0`: Holyfield wins the round
