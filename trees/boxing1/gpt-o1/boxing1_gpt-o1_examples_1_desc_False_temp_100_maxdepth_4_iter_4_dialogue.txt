Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree you provided. This function takes a dictionary `X` with the keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`. It returns the prediction (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes, where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied, and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes

    nodes[0] = int(X["Round"] <= 6)
    nodes[1] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Judge"] in [3, 6, 8, 9])

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Round <= 6
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
    else:
        # Round > 6
        if nodes[1]:
            # Official judge = yes
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
        else:
            # Official judge = no
            if nodes[2]:
                # Judge in [HBO-Lederman, Sportsline, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach]
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
            else:
                # Judge in [Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Associated Press]
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**
  - `Judge`: Coded as follows:
    - `0`: E. Williams
    - `1`: L. O'Connell
    - `2`: S. Christodoulu
    - `3`: HBO-Lederman
    - `4`: Sportsticker
    - `5`: Boxing Times
    - `6`: Sportsline
    - `7`: Associated Press
    - `8`: ESPN
    - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - `Official`: `1` for Yes, `0` for No
  - `Round`: An integer from `1` to `12`

- **Inner Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if `Round` is less than or equal to `6`.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if `Official` judge is `Yes` (`1`).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if `Judge` is in `[3, 6, 8, 9]` (judges who tended to favor Lewis).

- **Prediction:**
  - `1` indicates **Lewis** wins the round.
  - `0` indicates **Holyfield** wins the round.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Judge': 4,      # Sportsticker
    'Official': 0,   # Not an official judge
    'Round': 7       # Round number
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Lewis wins" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield wins")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Holyfield wins
Nodes: [0, 0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0] = 0**: Round is not less than or equal to 6 (`7 <= 6` is False).
- **nodes[1] = 0**: Official judge is not `Yes` (`0 == 1` is False).
- **nodes[2] = 0**: Judge is not in `[3, 6, 8, 9]` (`4 in [3,6,8,9]` is False).
- Therefore, the prediction is **Holyfield wins the round**.

**Another Example:**

```python
# Example input
X = {
    'Judge': 3,      # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0,   # Not an official judge
    'Round': 8       # Round number
}

# Get prediction and nodes
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

# Output the results
print("Prediction:", "Lewis wins" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield wins")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis wins
Nodes: [0, 0, 1]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0] = 0**: Round is not less than or equal to 6 (`8 <= 6` is False).
- **nodes[1] = 0**: Official judge is not `Yes` (`0 == 1` is False).
- **nodes[2] = 1**: Judge is in `[3, 6, 8, 9]` (`3 in [3,6,8,9]` is True).
- Therefore, the prediction is **Lewis wins the round**.

Feel free to use this function with different input values to predict the winner of each round based on the given features.
