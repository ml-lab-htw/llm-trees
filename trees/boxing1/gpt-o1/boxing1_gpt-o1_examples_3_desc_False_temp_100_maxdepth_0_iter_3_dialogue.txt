        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:

            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Nodes List**:
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is **unofficial**. It will be `1` if `Official` is `0` (No), and `0` otherwise.
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the `Round` number is **6 or less**. It will be `1` if `Round` â‰¤ 6, and `0` otherwise.

- **Decision Logic**:
  - **If** the judge is **unofficial** (`nodes[0] == 1`):
    - **Then** predict `1` (**Lewis wins**), as all unofficial judges favored Lewis.
  - **Else** (the judge is official):
    - **If** the round is **6 or less** (`nodes[1] == 1`):
      - **Then** predict `0` (**Holyfield wins**), as official judges favored Holyfield in early rounds.
    - **Else** (round is greater than 6):
      - **Then** predict `1` (**Lewis wins**), as official judges favored Lewis in later rounds.

### **Feature Encoding Reference:**

- **Features:**
  - `Judge`:
    - `0` = E. Williams
    - `1` = L. O'Connell
    - `2` = S. Christodoulu
    - `3` = HBO-Lederman
    - `4` = Sportsticker
    - `5` = Boxing Times
    - `6` = Sportsline
    - `7` = Associated Press
    - `8` = ESPN
    - `9` = Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - `Official`:
    - `1` = Yes
    - `0` = No
  - `Round`: `1` to `12`

- **Target Variable:**
  - `1` = **Lewis**
  - `0` = **Holyfield**

### **Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is unofficial and the round is 5
X = {
    "Judge": 4,       # Sportsticker
    "Official": 0,    # No
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction} ({'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'})")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
Nodes: [1, 1]
```

### **Note:**

- This function only uses the `Official` status and `Round` number for prediction, as these were identified as the most important features.
- The `Judge` feature is provided for completeness but is not used in the decision logic based on the given decision tree.
- The `nodes` list represents the evaluation of the decision tree conditions:
  - A value of `1` indicates the condition at that node is **True**.
  - A value of `0` indicates the condition at that node is **False**.
