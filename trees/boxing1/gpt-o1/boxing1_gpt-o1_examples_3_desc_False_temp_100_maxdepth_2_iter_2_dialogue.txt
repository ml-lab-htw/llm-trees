Certainly! Based on the provided decision tree and the exact feature encodings, here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list for node conditions

    # Node 0: Check if 'Official' is No (0)
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 0  # True if 'Official' is No, False otherwise

    if nodes[0]:
        # Official == No
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (1 = Lewis)
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated in this branch
    else:
        # Official == Yes
        # Node 1: Check if 'Judge' is E. Williams (0)
        nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 0  # True if 'Judge' is E. Williams, False otherwise

        if nodes[1]:
            # Judge == E. Williams
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins (0 = Holyfield)
        else:
            # Judge != E. Williams
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (1 = Lewis)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the first decision node: whether `Official` is `0` (No).
  - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the second decision node: whether `Judge` is `0` (E. Williams). This node is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `False`.
  
- **Feature Encodings:**
  - **Judge**:
    - `0` = E. Williams
    - `1` = L. O'Connell
    - `2` = S. Christodoulu
    - `3` = HBO-Lederman
    - `4` = Sportsticker
    - `5` = Boxing Times
    - `6` = Sportsline
    - `7` = Associated Press
    - `8` = ESPN
    - `9` = Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - **Official**:
    - `1` = Yes
    - `0` = No
  - **Round**:
    - Ranges from `1` to `12` but is not used in this tree due to maximum depth constraint.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `1` = Lewis
  - `0` = Holyfield

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is an unofficial judge
X_example1 = {'Judge': 5, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 7}
prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X_example1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}, Nodes: {nodes1}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, None]

# Example input where the official judge is E. Williams
X_example2 = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X_example2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}, Nodes: [False, True]")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False, True]

# Example input where the official judge is not E. Williams
X_example3 = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction3, nodes3 = predict(X_example3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction3}, Nodes: [False, False]")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [False, False]
```

**Explanation of Examples:**

- **Example 1:**
  - `Official` is `0` (No), so `nodes[0]` is `True`.
  - Prediction is `1` (Lewis wins).
  - `nodes[1]` is `None` because the second condition isn't evaluated.

- **Example 2:**
  - `Official` is `1` (Yes), so `nodes[0]` is `False`.
  - `Judge` is `0` (E. Williams), so `nodes[1]` is `True`.
  - Prediction is `0` (Holyfield wins).

- **Example 3:**
  - `Official` is `1` (Yes), so `nodes[0]` is `False`.
  - `Judge` is `1` (L. O'Connell), so `nodes[1]` is `False`.
  - Prediction is `1` (Lewis wins).

**Notes:**

- The function strictly adheres to the maximum depth of 2.
- All feature names and encodings match exactly as specified.
- The `nodes` list accurately reflects the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` if the condition is satisfied (`True` in Python).
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied (`False` in Python).
  - `None` if the node wasn't evaluated.

**Summary:**

This decision tree function uses the most significant features within the constraint of maximum depth to predict the winner of each round between Lewis and Holyfield. It accounts for whether the judge is official and specifically checks for Judge E. Williams due to her notable scoring.
