def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0  # Not an official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Round number

    if nodes[0]:  # Not official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Early round
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (hypothetical)
        else:        # Late round
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (hypothetical)
    else:         # Official judge
        if X["Judge"] <= 2: # Simplified split – first three judges alphabetically
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (hypothetical – closer scoring/potential draw influence. It's highly simplified due to lack of data) 
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis (hypothetical)

    return prediction, nodes

**Explanation and Improvements:**

* **Thresholds:** I've replaced the placeholder thresholds with concrete values.  For "Round," 6 is the midpoint, reflecting the hypothetical early/late round advantage. For "Judge," using alphabetical order for the split is a *very crude* placeholder.  In reality, this split should be based on some characteristic of the judges' scoring patterns. 
* **Feature Encoding:** The function uses the provided feature encoding (0/1 for Official, 1-12 for Round, and 0-9 for Judge).
* **Target Encoding:** The function returns 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield, matching the specified target encoding.
* **Simplified Judge Split:** Due to the lack of real data, the split on the "Judge" feature is overly simplified. It uses an alphabetical split which isn't meaningful in a real-world scenario. With real data, we'd learn which judge characteristics correlate with different scoring patterns.
* **Hypothetical Outcomes:**  The predictions are still hypothetical. The logic represents a plausible decision tree structure, but without actual fight data, the outcomes are just illustrative.



To reiterate, using judge names directly is not a good practice in a real-world scenario. We'd need features that capture their scoring tendencies (e.g., average points awarded per round, frequency of awarding 10-8 rounds, etc.) rather than their identities. This example primarily serves to demonstrate the requested function structure and the basic logic of a decision tree.
