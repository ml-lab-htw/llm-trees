Sure! Based on the decision tree and the features you've provided, here's the decision tree formatted as a Python function. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a prediction along with a list of truth values (`nodes`) for the inner nodes. Each entry in `nodes` is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3  # Initialize a list of three elements

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)  # 1 if Official == 1 (Yes), else 0

    # Node 1: Check if the judge is S. Christodoulou
    nodes[1] = int(X['Judge'] == 2)  # 1 if Judge == 2 (S. Christodoulou), else 0

    # Node 2: Check if the round is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[2] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)  # 1 if Round <= 6, else 0

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge == Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge == S. Christodoulou
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:  # Official judge == No
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **nodes[0]** corresponds to the condition: `X['Official'] == 1` (Is the judge official?)
- **nodes[1]** corresponds to the condition: `X['Judge'] == 2` (Is the judge S. Christodoulou?)
- **nodes[2]** corresponds to the condition: `X['Round'] <= 6` (Is the round less than or equal to 6?)

Each node is evaluated regardless of the path taken in the decision tree.

### Usage Example:

Here's how you might use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    'Judge': 2,       # S. Christodoulou
    'Official': 1,    # Yes
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Output:

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [1, 1, 1]
```

### Node Interpretation:

- **nodes[0] = 1**: The judge is an official judge.
- **nodes[1] = 1**: The judge is S. Christodoulou.
- **nodes[2] = 1**: The round is less than or equal to 6.

### Additional Notes:

- **Feature Keys**: Make sure that the keys in the input dictionary `X` exactly match the feature names: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.
- **Feature Encoding**:
  - **Judge**:
    - `0`: E. Williams
    - `1`: L. O'Connell
    - `2`: S. Christodoulou
    - `3`: HBO-Lederman
    - `4`: Sportsticker
    - `5`: Boxing Times
    - `6`: Sportsline
    - `7`: Associated Press
    - `8`: ESPN
    - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - **Official**:
    - `1`: Yes (Official judge)
    - `0`: No (Unofficial or media judge)
  - **Round**:
    - An integer from `1` to `12`.

- **Target Variable**:
  - `1`: Lewis wins the round.
  - `0`: Holyfield wins the round.

### Testing the Function:

You can test the function with various inputs to see how it behaves.

#### Test Case 1:

```python
X_test1 = {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test1)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")  # Output: Lewis
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [1, 1, 1]
```

#### Test Case 2:

```python
X_test2 = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test2)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")  # Output: Holyfield
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [1, 0, 1]
```

#### Test Case 3:

```python
X_test3 = {'Judge': 5, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_test3)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")  # Output: Lewis
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: [0, 0, 0]
```

### Decision Logic Overview:

- **Official Judges**:
  - If the judge is official (`Official == 1`):
    - If the judge is S. Christodoulou (`Judge == 2`), Lewis tends to win.
    - If the round is in the first half (`Round <= 6`), Holyfield tends to win.
    - Otherwise, Lewis tends to win.
- **Unofficial Judges**:
  - If the round is in the first half (`Round <= 6`), Holyfield tends to win.
  - Otherwise, Lewis tends to win.

This function uses the most important features and adheres to the maximum depth of 3 as specified. It returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes, providing insight into the decision-making process of the classifier.
