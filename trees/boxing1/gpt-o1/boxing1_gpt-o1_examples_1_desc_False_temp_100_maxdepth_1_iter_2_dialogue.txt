Certainly! Based on your specifications, here's the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. The function returns the prediction (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

**Decision Tree Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Checking if the judge is an official judge

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - `"Judge"`: Encoded as specified but not used in this depth-1 decision tree.
  - `"Official"`: `1` for Yes (official judge), `0` for No (unofficial judge).
  - `"Round"`: From 1 to 12, not used in this depth-1 decision tree.

- **Decision Logic:**
  - We use the `"Official"` feature to split the data.
  - **Node 0 Condition:** `X["Official"] == 1`
    - If the condition is **True** (`nodes[0]` is `True`), the prediction is `1` (Lewis).
    - If the condition is **False** (`nodes[0]` is `False`), the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).

- **Thresholds and Values:**
  - Since `"Official"` is a binary feature (`1` or `0`), the threshold is specifically checking for equality to `1`.

**Usage Examples:**

1. **Official Judge Example:**

   ```python
   X = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}  # E. Williams, Official Judge, Round 5
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
   # Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True]
   ```
   - **Explanation:** Since `Official` is `1`, `nodes[0]` is `True`, so the prediction is `1` (Lewis).

2. **Unofficial Judge Example:**

   ```python
   X = {'Judge': 3, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 7}  # HBO-Lederman, Unofficial Judge, Round 7
   prediction, nodes = predict(X)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: [nodes}")
   # Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False]
   ```
   - **Explanation:** Since `Official` is `0`, `nodes[0]` is `False`, so the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).

**Complete Function with Comments:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxer won the round based on the 'Official' feature.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): Input features with keys exactly as ['Judge', 'Official', 'Round']

    Returns:
    Tuple[int, list]: A tuple containing the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield)
                      and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Initialize list for inner node truth values
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Node 0: Check if judge is official

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encodings (as provided):**
  - **Judge:**
    - `0` = E. Williams
    - `1` = L. O'Connell
    - `2` = S. Christodoulu
    - `3` = HBO-Lederman
    - `4` = Sportsticker
    - `5` = Boxing Times
    - `6` = Sportsline
    - `7` = Associated Press
    - `8` = ESPN
    - `9` = Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - **Official:**
    - `1` = Yes
    - `0` = No
  - **Round:**
    - `1` to `12`

- **Target Variable:**
  - `1` = Lewis
  - `0` = Holyfield

- **Assumptions:**
  - The most important feature for predicting the winner is whether the judge is an official judge.
  - Official judges tend to score in favor of Lewis, while unofficial judges favor Holyfield.

- **Thresholds:**
  - Since `"Official"` is binary, the threshold is checking equality to `1`.

**Example Test Case:**

```python
# Test data
test_cases = [
    {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 1},  # Official judge
    {'Judge': 4, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 2},  # Unofficial judge
    {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3},
    {'Judge': 7, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 4}
]

for i, X in enumerate(test_cases):
    prediction, nodes = predict(X)
    print(f"Test Case {i+1}:")
    print(f"Input: {X}")
    print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
    print(f"Nodes: {nodes}\n")
```

**Output:**

```
Test Case 1:
Input: {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 1}
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [True]

Test Case 2:
Input: {'Judge': 4, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 2}
Prediction: Holyfield
Nodes: [False]

Test Case 3:
Input: {'Judge': 2, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3}
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [True]

Test Case 4:
Input: {'Judge': 7, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 4}
Prediction: Holyfield
Nodes: [False]
```

This function satisfies your requirements:

- Uses the exact keys of the features: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, `'Round'`.
- Returns a single prediction (`1` or `0`) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
- The feature `"Official"` is used with a meaningful threshold (`== 1` for Yes).
- The entries of the `nodes` list are `1` (`True`) if the condition is satisfied, and `0` (`False`) otherwise.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs!
