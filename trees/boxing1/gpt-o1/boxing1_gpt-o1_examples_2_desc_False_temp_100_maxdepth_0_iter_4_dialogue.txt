Certainly! Based on the features and the target variable encoding you've provided, here's the Python function implementing the decision tree:

**Adjusted Decision Tree:**

```
|--- Official == 1 (Yes)
|    |--- Judge == 1 (L. O'Connell)
|        |--- Prediction: Holyfield (0)
|    |--- Judge != 1
|        |--- Prediction: Holyfield (0)
|--- Official == 0 (No)
|    |--- Prediction: Lewis (1)
```

**Python Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # List to store truth values of inner nodes
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)  # Node 0: Is the judge official?
    if nodes[0]:  # Official == 1 (Yes)
        nodes[1] = int(X['Judge'] == 1)  # Node 1: Is Judge L. O'Connell?
        # Regardless of whether it's L. O'Connell or another official judge, predict Holyfield
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        nodes[1] = None  # Node 1 is not evaluated when Official == 0
        # Unofficial judges tend to favor Lewis
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features and Encodings:**
  - **Judge**:
    - 0: E. Williams
    - 1: L. O'Connell
    - 2: S. Christodoulu
    - 3: HBO-Lederman
    - 4: Sportsticker
    - 5: Boxing Times
    - 6: Sportsline
    - 7: Associated Press
    - 8: ESPN
    - 9: Boxing Monthly-Leach
  - **Official**:
    - 1: Yes
    - 0: No
  - **Round**: 1 to 12 (Not used in this tree)

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Represents whether the judge is official (`1` if **Yes**, `0` if **No**).
  - `nodes[1]`: Represents whether the official judge is L. O'Connell (`1` if **Yes**, `0` if **No**). It's set to `None` if the judge is not official.

**Function Logic:**

1. **Node 0** checks if the judge is an **official judge**.
   - `nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 1)`
   - If **Official == 1** (Yes), proceed to **Node 1**.
   - If **Official == 0** (No), predict **Lewis (1)**.

2. **Node 1** checks if the official judge is **L. O'Connell**.
   - `nodes[1] = int(X['Judge'] == 1)`
   - Regardless of whether it's L. O'Connell or another official judge, predict **Holyfield (0)**.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the judge is **official**, predict **Holyfield (0)**.
   - If the judge is **not official**, predict **Lewis (1)**.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example 1: Official judge is L. O'Connell
X_example1 = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction1, nodes1 = predict(X_example1)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction1}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes1}")            # Output: Nodes: [1, 1]

# Example 2: Official judge is E. Williams
X_example2 = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3}
prediction2, nodes2 = predict(X_example2)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction2}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes2}")            # Output: Nodes: [1, 0]

# Example 3: Unofficial judge is Boxing Times
X_example3 = {'Judge': 5, 'Official': 0, 'Round': 8}
prediction3, nodes3 = predict(X_example3)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction3}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes3}")            # Output: Nodes: [0, None]
```

**Notes:**

- The decision tree focuses on the **Official** status of the judge as the primary feature.
- **Round** is not used in this decision tree since it's not a significant factor based on the provided information.
- The function mirrors the format of your examples, returning both the prediction and the list of node truth values.
- The entries in the `nodes` list are set to `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` if not. If a node isn't evaluated (e.g., `nodes[1]` when the judge is unofficial), it's set to `None`.

**Conclusion:**

This function implements the decision tree classifier based on the features you provided. It uses the most important features to predict which fighter won each round, adhering to the target variable encoding of **1 = Lewis** and **0 = Holyfield**. The function returns the prediction along with a list indicating the truth values of the inner nodes, as per your instructions.
