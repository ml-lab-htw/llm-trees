This function implements the decision tree using the most important features—`Official`, `Judge`, and `Round`—to predict which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. It also returns a list of truth values (`nodes`) representing whether each condition in the inner nodes is satisfied (1 if satisfied, 0 otherwise).

**Explanation of the Nodes:**

- **Node 0** (`nodes[0]`): Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` = 1).
- **Node 1** (`nodes[1]`): If the judge is official, checks if the judge is E. Williams (0) or L. O'Connell (1).
- **Node 2** (`nodes[2]`): Checks if the judge is S. Christodoulou (2).
- **Node 3** (`nodes[3]`): For S. Christodoulou, checks if the round is less than or equal to 6 (`Round` ≤ 6).
- **Node 4** (`nodes[4]`): If the judge is unofficial, checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (3), Associated Press (7), or ESPN (8).
- **Node 5** (`nodes[5]`): For other unofficial judges, checks if the round is less than or equal to 8 (`Round` ≤ 8).

**Feature Key Encodings:**

- **Judge**:
  - 0: E. Williams
  - 1: L. O'Connell
  - 2: S. Christodoulou
  - 3: HBO-Lederman
  - 4: Sportsticker
  - 5: Boxing Times
  - 6: Sportsline
  - 7: Associated Press
  - 8: ESPN
  - 9: Boxing Monthly-Leach
- **Official**:
  - 1: Yes
  - 0: No
- **Round**: An integer from 1 to 12.

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- **0**: Holyfield wins the round.
- **1**: Lewis wins the round.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is E. Williams (0), an official judge (1), and it's round 5
X_example = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `1` because the judge is an official judge.
- `nodes[1]` is `1` because the judge is E. Williams.
- The function predicts `1`, which corresponds to Lewis winning the round.

**Note:**

- The function assumes that all feature values provided in `X` are valid and correctly encoded as per the specified encodings.
- If the judge is not among those specified in the tree (e.g., an unknown judge), the function defaults to predicting `Holyfield` in the official judge branch and might not behave as expected.
