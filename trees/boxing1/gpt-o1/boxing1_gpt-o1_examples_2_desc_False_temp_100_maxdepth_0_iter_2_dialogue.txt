```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 9  # Initialize a list of 9 nodes

    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 0  # Node 1: Judge = E. Williams
    nodes[2] = X['Judge'] == 1  # Node 2: Judge = L. O'Connell
    nodes[3] = X['Judge'] == 2  # Node 3: Judge = S. Christodoulu
    nodes[4] = X['Round'] <= 6  # Node 4: Round <= 6
    nodes[5] = X['Round'] <= 4  # Node 5: Round <= 4
    nodes[6] = X['Round'] <= 5  # Node 6: Round <= 5
    nodes[7] = X['Judge'] == 3  # Node 7: Judge = HBO-Lederman
    nodes[8] = X['Round'] <= 7  # Node 8: Round <= 7

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge = Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge = E. Williams
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[2]:  # Judge = L. O'Connell
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[3]:  # Judge = S. Christodoulu
            if nodes[6]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Judge not recognized among official judges
    else:  # Official Judge = No
        if nodes[7]:  # Judge = HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[8]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            # For all other non-official judges (Judges 4 to 9)
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
