Certainly! Based on the features and target variable you've provided, here's a Python function representing the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 3
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
    nodes[1] = int(X["Round"] <= 6)
    nodes[2] = int(X["Judge"] <= 2)  # Judges 0, 1, 2 are official judges

    if nodes[0]:  # Official == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Official == 0
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` is `1`).
  - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the round is in the first half (`Round` ≤ 6).
  - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the judge is among the official judges (`Judge` ≤ 2).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If** `Official` is **`1`** (official judge):
    - **If** `Round` ≤ **6**:
      - **Predict**: **`0`** (Holyfield wins)
    - **Else** (`Round` > 6):
      - **Predict**: **`1`** (Lewis wins)
  - **Else** (`Official` is `0`, unofficial judge):
    - **Predict**: **`1`** (Lewis wins)

**Notes:**

- The function returns:
  - `prediction`: The predicted winner (`1` for **Lewis**, `0` for **Holyfield**).
  - `nodes`: A list of truth values (as integers `1` or `0`) indicating whether each condition is satisfied.
    - Each element in `nodes` corresponds to a condition in the decision tree.
    - `1` means the condition is satisfied, `0` means it is not.

- The decision tree is built using the most significant features:
  - **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge.
  - **Round**: The round number.
  - **Judge**: Identifies the specific judge.

- **Thresholds** are chosen based on meaningful splits in the data:
  - **Round ≤ 6**: Differentiates early rounds from later rounds.
  - **Judge ≤ 2**: Separates official judges from others.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example input
X_example = {
    "Judge": 1,      # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 5       # Round 5
}

# Make prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")         # Outputs: Prediction: 0
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")                   # Outputs: Nodes: [1, 1, 1]
```

In this example:

- `nodes[0]` is `1` because `Official` is `1` (official judge).
- `nodes[1]` is `1` because `Round` is `5`, which is ≤ 6.
- `nodes[2]` is `1` because `Judge` is `1`, which is ≤ 2.
- The prediction is `0`, indicating **Holyfield** is predicted to have won this round according to this decision tree.

**Understanding the Decision Tree:**

- **Official Judges (nodes[0] == 1):**
  - Early Rounds (nodes[1] == 1): Tend to favor **Holyfield**.
  - Later Rounds (nodes[1] == 0): Tend to favor **Lewis**.
- **Unofficial Judges (nodes[0] == 0):**
  - Regardless of the round, tend to favor **Lewis**.

This decision tree captures the patterns in how different judges scored the fight across rounds, using the most significant features available.
