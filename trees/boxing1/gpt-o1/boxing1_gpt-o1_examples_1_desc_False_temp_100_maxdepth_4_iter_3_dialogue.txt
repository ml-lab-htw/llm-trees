Certainly! Based on the provided decision tree and feature encodings, here is the Python function that predicts which boxer won each round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield). The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes, where each entry is `1` if the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [0] * 6  # Initialize a list of 6 nodes with 0

    # Node 0
    nodes[0] = int(X['Official'] == 0)  # Official == 0 (No)

    if nodes[0]:
        # If Official == No
        prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis
    else:
        # If Official == Yes
        # Node 1
        nodes[1] = int(X['Judge'] == 1)  # Judge == L. O'Connell

        if nodes[1]:
            # Since we cannot classify 'Draw' in binary 0 or 1, we'll map it to Holyfield (0)
            prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield
        else:
            # Node 2
            nodes[2] = int(X['Judge'] == 0)  # Judge == E. Williams

            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3
                nodes[3] = int(X['Round'] <= 6)  # Round <= 6

                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield
            else:
                # Node 4
                nodes[4] = int(X['Judge'] == 2)  # Judge == S. Christodoulou

                if nodes[4]:
                    # Node 5
                    nodes[5] = int(X['Round'] <= 8)  # Round <= 8

                    if nodes[5]:
                        prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield
                else:
                    # For other judges not specified in the tree, default prediction
                    prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes List (`nodes`):**
  - **nodes[0]:** Checks if `Official` is `0` (No).
  - **nodes[1]:** Checks if `Judge` is `1` (L. O'Connell).
  - **nodes[2]:** Checks if `Judge` is `0` (E. Williams).
  - **nodes[3]:** Checks if `Round` is less than or equal to `6`.
  - **nodes[4]:** Checks if `Judge` is `2` (S. Christodoulou).
  - **nodes[5]:** Checks if `Round` is less than or equal to `8`.

- **Decision Logic:**

  1. **Root Node (`nodes[0]`):**
     - If `Official` is `0` (No), predict **Lewis** (`1`).
     - Else, proceed to check which official judge it is.

  2. **Judge == L. O'Connell (`nodes[1]`):**
     - If `Judge` is `1`, predict **Holyfield** (`0`).
       - *Note:* Since the class 'Draw' cannot be directly represented in a binary classification (0 or 1), we map it to `0` (Holyfield) for this function.

  3. **Judge == E. Williams (`nodes[2]`):**
     - If `Judge` is `0`, check the `Round`:
       - **Round <= 6 (`nodes[3]`):**
         - If `Round` is less than or equal to `6`, predict **Lewis** (`1`).
       - **Round > 6:**
         - Else, predict **Holyfield** (`0`).

  4. **Judge == S. Christodoulou (`nodes[4]`):**
     - If `Judge` is `2`, check the `Round`:
       - **Round <= 8 (`nodes[5]`):**
         - If `Round` is less than or equal to `8`, predict **Lewis** (`1`).
       - **Round > 8:**
         - Else, predict **Holyfield** (`0`).

  5. **Other Judges:**
     - For any other judges not specified (i.e., judges with codes `3` to `9`), default to predicting **Holyfield** (`0`).

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input features:

```python
X = {
    'Judge': 0,       # E. Williams
    'Official': 1,    # Yes
    'Round': 5
}
```

Calling the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

Output:

```
Prediction: 1
Nodes: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0] = 0` (Official judge is Yes)
  - `nodes[1] = 0` (Judge is not L. O'Connell)
  - `nodes[2] = 1` (Judge is E. Williams)
  - `nodes[3] = 1` (Round <= 6)
  - `nodes[4] = 0` (Judge is not S. Christodoulou)
  - `nodes[5] = 0` (Not evaluated since `nodes[4]` is `0`)

- **Prediction:** `1` (Lewis)

**Notes:**

- **Feature Keys and Encodings:**

  - `'Judge'`:
    - `0` = E. Williams
    - `1` = L. O'Connell
    - `2` = S. Christodoulou
    - `3` = HBO-Lederman
    - `4` = Sportsticker
    - `5` = Boxing Times
    - `6` = Sportsline
    - `7` = Associated Press
    - `8` = ESPN
    - `9` = Boxing Monthly-Leach

  - `'Official'`:
    - `1` = Yes
    - `0` = No

  - `'Round'`: Integer from `1` to `12`.

- **Target Variable Encoding:**
  - `1` = Lewis
  - `0` = Holyfield

- **Handling 'Draw':**

  - Since the target variable only accepts `0` or `1`, we mapped the 'Draw' outcome (from Judge L. O'Connell) to `0` (Holyfield) for binary classification purposes.

- **Thresholds and Conditions:**

  - The thresholds used (e.g., `Round <= 6`, `Round <= 8`) are meaningful values derived from the decision tree, reflecting changes in judges' scoring patterns over the rounds.

**Final Remarks:**

- This function mirrors the decision tree with a maximum depth of 4, using the most significant features.
- The `nodes` list provides a transparent view of the decision path taken for each prediction.
- You can test the function with different input features to see how predictions are made based on the rules defined.
