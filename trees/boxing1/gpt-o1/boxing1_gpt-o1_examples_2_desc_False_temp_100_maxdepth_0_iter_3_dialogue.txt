Certainly! Below is the `predict` function formatted according to your specifications. This function implements the decision tree using the exact feature keys you've provided and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Each entry in the list `nodes` corresponds to a condition in the decision tree, with `1` indicating the condition is satisfied and `0` otherwise.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    nodes[0] = 1 if X["Official"] == 1 else 0  # Is Official Judge == Yes?
    nodes[1] = 1 if X["Judge"] == 1 else 0     # Is Judge == L. O'Connell?
    nodes[2] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 4 else 0     # Is Round <= 4?
    nodes[3] = 1 if X["Judge"] == 0 else 0     # Is Judge == E. Williams?
    nodes[4] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0     # Is Round <= 6?
    nodes[5] = 1 if X["Judge"] == 2 else 0     # Is Judge == S. Christodoulu?
    nodes[6] = 1 if X["Round"] <= 5 else 0     # Is Round <= 5?

    if nodes[0]:  # Official Judge == Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge == L. O'Connell
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 4
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[3]:  # Judge == E. Williams
            if nodes[4]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[5]:  # Judge == S. Christodoulu
            if nodes[6]:  # Round <= 5
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            # Other Official Judges not specified in the tree
            prediction = 1  # Default to Lewis
    else:
        # Official Judge == No
        prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

### **Explanation:**

**Features:**

- **Judge**: Encoded as integers:
  - `0`: E. Williams
  - `1`: L. O'Connell
  - `2`: S. Christodoulu
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Boxing Times
  - `6`: Sportsline
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: ESPN
  - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach

- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge.
  - `1`: Yes
  - `0`: No

- **Round**: Round number from `1` to `12`.

**Target Variable:**

- **Prediction**:
  - `0`: Holyfield wins the round.
  - `1`: Lewis wins the round.

---

### **Nodes List:**

Each element in the `nodes` list represents the truth value of a condition in the decision tree.

- `nodes[0]`: `1` if `Official == 1` (Yes), else `0`.
- `nodes[1]`: `1` if `Judge == 1` (L. O'Connell), else `0`.
- `nodes[2]`: `1` if `Round <= 4`, else `0`.
- `nodes[3]`: `1` if `Judge == 0` (E. Williams), else `0`.
- `nodes[4]`: `1` if `Round <= 6`, else `0`.
- `nodes[5]`: `1` if `Judge == 2` (S. Christodoulu), else `0`.
- `nodes[6]`: `1` if `Round <= 5`, else `0`.

---

### **Decision Logic:**

1. **Check if the Judge is Official:**

   - **`nodes[0]`**: If `Official == 1`, proceed to check which official judge.
   - If `Official == 0` (No), predict **Lewis** (`1`).

2. **For Official Judges:**

   - **Judge L. O'Connell (`nodes[1]`):**
     - **Round <= 4 (`nodes[2]`):** Predict **Holyfield** (`0`).
     - **Round > 4:** Predict **Lewis** (`1`).

   - **Judge E. Williams (`nodes[3]`):**
     - **Round <= 6 (`nodes[4]`):** Predict **Holyfield** (`0`).
     - **Round > 6:** Predict **Lewis** (`1`).

   - **Judge S. Christodoulu (`nodes[5]`):**
     - **Round <= 5 (`nodes[6]`):** Predict **Holyfield** (`0`).
     - **Round > 5:** Predict **Lewis** (`1`).

   - **Other Official Judges:**
     - Predict **Lewis** (`1`) by default.

3. **For Unofficial Judges:**

   - Predict **Lewis** (`1`).

### **Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
X_sample = {
    "Judge": 1,     # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,  # Yes
    "Round": 3
}
```

Calling the function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction:", "Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Holyfield
Nodes: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### **Notes:**

- **Threshold Values:**
  - The thresholds for the rounds (`<= 4`, `<= 5`, `<= 6`) are meaningful values derived from the decision tree, indicating shifts in which fighter was favored during different phases of the match.

- **Handling Unspecified Judges:**
  - In cases where an official judge is not one of the three specified (`E. Williams`, `L. O'Connell`, `S. Christodoulu`), the function defaults to predicting **Lewis**.
  - This is based on the assumption from the tree that unspecified official judges lean towards Lewis.

- **Consistency with Feature Encoding:**
  - The function strictly adheres to the exact keys and encodings provided for the features.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This function allows you to input the features of a specific round judged by a particular judge and receive a prediction on whether Lewis or Holyfield won that round, based on the induced decision tree classifier. The `nodes` list provides insight into which conditions were met during the prediction process.
