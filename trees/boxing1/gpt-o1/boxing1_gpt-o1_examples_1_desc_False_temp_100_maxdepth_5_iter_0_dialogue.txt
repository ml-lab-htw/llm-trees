Certainly! Based on the features and the example you've provided, I'll format the decision tree as a Python function. The function will return a single prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. I'll fill in meaningful values for the thresholds and ensure that the feature names and encodings match exactly as specified.

**Features:**

- **Judge:** 
  - 0 = E. Williams
  - 1 = L. O'Connell
  - 2 = S. Christodoulu
  - 3 = HBO-Lederman
  - 4 = Sportsticker
  - 5 = Boxing Times
  - 6 = Sportsline
  - 7 = Associated Press
  - 8 = ESPN
  - 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach
- **Official:** 
  - 1 = Yes
  - 0 = No
- **Round:** 
  - 1 to 12

**Target Variable:**

- **Winner of the round:**
  - 1 = Lewis
  - 0 = Holyfield

**Decision Tree Function:**

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 5  # Initialize a list of 5 elements

    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: For official judges, is the round less than or equal to 6?
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 3: Is the judge E. Williams?
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins in later rounds among official judges
    else:
        # Node 2: Is the judge HBO-Lederman or ESPN?
        nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [3, 8]  # HBO-Lederman or ESPN
        if nodes[2]:
            # Node 4: For these judges, is the round less than or equal to 7?
            nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 7
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins among other unofficial judges
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation of the Function:**

- **nodes[0]:** Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` == 1).
- **nodes[1]:** For **official judges**, checks if the round is less than or equal to 6 (`Round` <= 6).
- **nodes[2]:** For **unofficial judges**, checks if the judge is either HBO-Lederman or ESPN (`Judge` in [3, 8]).
- **nodes[3]:** For **official judges** in early rounds, checks if the judge is E. Williams (`Judge` == 0).
- **nodes[4]:** For **unofficial judges** HBO-Lederman or ESPN, checks if the round is less than or equal to 7 (`Round` <= 7).

**Logic Flow:**

1. **Check if the judge is official** (`nodes[0]`):
   - **Yes (True):**
     - **Check the round number** (`nodes[1]`):
       - **Round ≤ 6 (nodes[1] == True):**
         - **Check if the judge is E. Williams** (`nodes[3]`):
           - **Yes (nodes[3] == True):** Predict **Lewis** (prediction = 1)
           - **No (nodes[3] == False):** Predict **Holyfield** (prediction = 0)
       - **Round > 6 (nodes[1] == False):**
         - Predict **Lewis** (prediction = 1)
   - **No (False):**
     - **Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman or ESPN** (`nodes[2]`):
       - **Yes (nodes[2] == True):**
         - **Check the round number** (`nodes[4]`):
           - **Round ≤ 7 (nodes[4] == True):** Predict **Lewis** (prediction = 1)
           - **Round > 7 (nodes[4] == False):** Predict **Holyfield** (prediction = 0)
       - **No (nodes[2] == False):** Predict **Holyfield** (prediction = 0)

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following data for a round:

```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,      # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 5
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Lewis
Nodes: [True, True, None, True, None]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **nodes[0]:** True (Official judge)
- **nodes[1]:** True (Round ≤ 6)
- **nodes[3]:** True (Judge is E. Williams)
- **Prediction:** Lewis wins the round.

**Notes:**

- The function strictly follows the specified feature names and encodings.
- Unused nodes are left as `None`.
- This function provides both the prediction and the list of node evaluations, which can be helpful for understanding the decision-making process at each step.
- The thresholds and conditions are filled with meaningful values based on the provided decision tree and logical extensions to reach a depth of 5.

**Conclusion:**

The decision tree function effectively models the prediction of which boxer won each round based on the most significant features: **Official**, **Round**, and **Judge**. By structuring the function to reflect the decision tree with a maximum depth of 5, we ensure that all critical decision points are captured, and the function remains interpretable and aligned with the provided example.

Feel free to test the function with different inputs or provide additional data if you'd like further refinements!
