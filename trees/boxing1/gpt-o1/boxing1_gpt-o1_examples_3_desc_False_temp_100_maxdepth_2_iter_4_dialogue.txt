Certainly! Based on the features provided—**Judge**, **Official**, and **Round**—and following the format specified in the examples, here is a Python function that represents a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. This function predicts which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Only evaluated if nodes[0] is True
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features:**
  - **Judge:** Judge (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
  - **Official:** Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
  - **Round:** Round number (1 to 12)

- **Target Variable:**
  - **target:** Which of the two boxing fighters won each round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)

- **Decision Tree Logic:**
  1. **Node 0:** Check if the judge is an **Official** judge.
     - `nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1`
  2. **Node 1:** If the judge is official (`nodes[0]` is `True`), check if the **Round** number is less than or equal to 6.
     - `nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6`
     - **If `nodes[1]` is `True`:**
       - Predict **Holyfield** (`prediction = 0`)
     - **Else (`nodes[1]` is `False`):**
       - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`)
  3. **Else:** If the judge is not official (`nodes[0]` is `False`), predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).

- **Nodes List:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Evaluates to `1` (True) if the judge is official (`X["Official"] == 1`), else `0` (False).
  - `nodes[1]`: Evaluates to `1` (True) if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`), else `0` (False). This node is only relevant if `nodes[0]` is `True`.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input features:

```python
X_sample = {
    "Judge": 1,        # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,     # Yes
    "Round": 4         # Round 4
}
```

Calling the `predict` function:

```python
prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print("Prediction:", "Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: Holyfield
Nodes: [True, True]
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]` is `True` because the judge is official (`Official` == 1).
  - `nodes[1]` is `True` because the round is less than or equal to 6 (`Round` <= 6).
- **Prediction:** The function predicts **Holyfield** as the winner of the round.

**Explanation of Thresholds:**

- The choice of splitting on `Official` at the root reflects the significance of official judges in determining the outcome.
- The threshold `Round <= 6` is a meaningful value to split the fight into two halves:
  - Early rounds (1-6): Based on historical data, official judges may have favored Holyfield.
  - Later rounds (7-12): Official judges may have shifted to favor Lewis.
  
**Important Notes:**

- **Thresholds:** The thresholds chosen (`Official` == 1 and `Round` <= 6) are based on the assumption that official judges favored Holyfield in the early rounds and Lewis in the later rounds. This reflects a meaningful split in the fight's progression.
- **List of Nodes:** The `nodes` list contains boolean values (`True` or `False`, which correspond to `1` or `0`), indicating whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied.
  - The length of the `nodes` list corresponds to the number of inner nodes in the decision tree.
