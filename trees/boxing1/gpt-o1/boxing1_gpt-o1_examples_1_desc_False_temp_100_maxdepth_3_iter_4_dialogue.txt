Certainly! Based on the decision tree and the feature descriptions you've provided, here's the Python function that maps your decision tree classifier. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` with keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`, and returns the prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2  # Initialize a list of 3 elements for the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = 1 if X['Official'] == 1 else 0  # Node 0: Is the judge official?
    nodes[1] = 1 if X['Round'] <= 6 else 0  # Node 1: Is the round less than or equal to 6?

    if nodes[0] == 1:
        if nodes[1] == 1:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**
  - We initialize a list `nodes` with `None` values to represent the inner nodes of the tree.
  - The decision tree has a maximum depth of 3, so we have 3 nodes in the list.

- **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):**
  - The first condition checks if the judge is an official judge.
    - `nodes[0] = 1 if X['Official'] == 1 else 0`
    - If `X['Official']` equals `1` (Yes), then `nodes[0]` is `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.
  
- **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):**
  - This node is only evaluated if `nodes[0]` is `1` (i.e., the judge is official).
  - The condition checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
    - `nodes[1] = 1 if X['Round'] <= 6 else 0`
    - If `X['Round']` is less than or equal to `6`, then `nodes[1]` is `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.
  - Based on `nodes[1]`, we make the prediction:
    - If `nodes[1]` is `1`, we predict `0` (Holyfield wins the round).
    - If `nodes[1]` is `0`, we predict `1` (Lewis wins the round).

- **Node 2 (`nodes[2]`):**
  - This node is not used in this tree, so we set it to `None`.
  
- **Prediction:**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `0` (i.e., the judge is not official), we predict that Lewis wins the round (`prediction = 1`).
  - `nodes[1]` is set to `None` in this case because it wasn't evaluated.

**Usage Example:**

Suppose we have the following input:

```python
# Example input where the judge is official and the round is 5
X_example = {
    'Judge': 0,      # E. Williams (but Judge is not used in this tree)
    'Official': 1,   # Yes
    'Round': 5       # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [1, 1, None]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Encodings:**
  - `'Judge'`: Encoded as integers from 0 to 9 (not used in this tree).
  - `'Official'`: `1` for Yes, `0` for No.
  - `'Round'`: Integer values from `1` to `12`.

- **Target Variable:**
  - `0` represents Holyfield winning the round.
  - `1` represents Lewis winning the round.

**Remember:**

- The `nodes` list represents the truth values of the inner nodes:
  - `1` if the condition at that node is satisfied.
  - `0` if the condition is not satisfied.
  - `None` if the node was not evaluated in the prediction path.

This function follows the format you provided and uses meaningful thresholds based on the information about the fight between Lewis and Holyfield.
