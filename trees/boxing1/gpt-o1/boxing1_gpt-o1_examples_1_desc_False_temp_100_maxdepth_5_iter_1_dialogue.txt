Certainly! Below is the Python function that represents the decision tree classifier based on the features you've provided. The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` containing the features 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round'. It returns the prediction (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield) and a list `nodes` representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]*5

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1  # Official judge: 1 = Yes

    # Node 1: Check if the judge is E. Williams
    nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 0  # Judge: 0 = E. Williams

    # Node 2: Check if the judge is L. O'Connell and Round <= 5
    nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] == 1) and (X['Round'] <= 5)  # Judge: 1 = L. O'Connell

    # Node 3: Check if the judge is S. Christodoulu and Round <= 6
    nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] == 2) and (X['Round'] <= 6)  # Judge: 2 = S. Christodoulu

    # Node 4 is not used in this decision tree
    nodes[4] = None

    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # If Judge is E. Williams
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[2]:  # If Judge is L. O'Connell and Round <= 5
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif nodes[3]:  # If Judge is S. Christodoulu and Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis (unofficial judges favor Lewis)

    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` feature).
  - **`nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1`**
  - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, the judge is an official judge.
- **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is **E. Williams**.
  - **`nodes[1] = X['Judge'] == 0`**
  - If `nodes[1]` is `True`, the judge is E. Williams.
- **Node 2**: Checks if the judge is **L. O'Connell** and the round is less than or equal to 5.
  - **`nodes[2] = (X['Judge'] == 1) and (X['Round'] <= 5)`**
  - If `nodes[2]` is `True`, the judge is L. O'Connell and it's Round 1-5.
- **Node 3**: Checks if the judge is **S. Christodoulu** and the round is less than or equal to 6.
  - **`nodes[3] = (X['Judge'] == 2) and (X['Round'] <= 6)`**
  - If `nodes[3]` is `True`, the judge is S. Christodoulu and it's Round 1-6.
- **Node 4**: Not used in this tree but included to maintain the list size.

**Prediction Logic:**

- If the judge is an **official judge** (`nodes[0]` is `True`):
  - If the judge is **E. Williams** (`nodes[1]` is `True`):
    - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).
  - Elif the judge is **L. O'Connell** during Rounds 1-5 (`nodes[2]` is `True`):
    - Predict **Holyfield** (`prediction = 0`).
  - Elif the judge is **S. Christodoulu** during Rounds 1-6 (`nodes[3]` is `True`):
    - Predict **Holyfield** (`prediction = 0`).
  - Else:
    - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`).
- Else (judge is not an official judge):
  - Predict **Lewis** (`prediction = 1`) since all unofficial judges favor Lewis.

**Example Usage:**

Let's say we have the following input:

```python
X_sample = {
    'Judge': 1,    # L. O'Connell
    'Official': 1, # Yes
    'Round': 4     # Round 4
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_sample)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: Nodes: [True, False, True, False, None]
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `nodes[0]`: `True` (Official judge)
  - `nodes[1]`: `False` (Judge is not E. Williams)
  - `nodes[2]`: `True` (Judge is L. O'Connell and Round <= 5)
  - `nodes[3]`: `False` (Judge is not S. Christodoulu or Round > 6)
  - `prediction`: `0` (Holyfield)

**Feature Encodings:**

- **Judge**:
  - `0`: E. Williams
  - `1`: L. O'Connell
  - `2`: S. Christodoulu
  - `3`: HBO-Lederman
  - `4`: Sportsticker
  - `5`: Boxing Times
  - `6`: Sportsline
  - `7`: Associated Press
  - `8`: ESPN
  - `9`: Boxing Monthly-Leach
- **Official**:
  - `1`: Yes
  - `0`: No
- **Round**:
  - `1` to `12`

**Target Variable Encoding:**

- `1`: Lewis
- `0`: Holyfield

**Notes:**

- The function adheres to a maximum depth of 5 by using five nodes.
- The list `nodes` contains boolean values indicating whether each condition is satisfied (`True`) or not (`False`).
- `nodes[4]` is set to `None` as it is not used in this tree but included to maintain consistency with the required format.

**Understanding the Decision Path:**

The function's logic is based on the tendencies of the judges:

- **E. Williams** consistently scores in favor of **Lewis**.
- **L. O'Connell** scores in favor of **Holyfield** in the early rounds (1-5) and in favor of **Lewis** in later rounds.
- **S. Christodoulu** scores in favor of **Holyfield** in rounds 1-6 and **Lewis** afterward.
- All **unofficial judges** consistently score in favor of **Lewis**.

By converting the decision tree into this function, we can programmatically predict the winner of a round based on the given features and also trace the conditions checked during the prediction.
