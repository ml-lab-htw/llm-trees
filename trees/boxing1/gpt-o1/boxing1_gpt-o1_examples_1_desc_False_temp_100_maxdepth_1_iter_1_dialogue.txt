```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]
    nodes[0] = int(X["Official"] == 1)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

**Explanation:**

- **Features Used:**
  - **Official**: Indicates whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

- **Decision Logic:**
  - The decision tree has a maximum depth of 1, using the most important feature, **Official**.
  - The condition checks if `X["Official"] == 1`:
    - If **Official** is `1` (Yes), the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = 1`), and we predict `1` (**Lewis**).
    - If **Official** is `0` (No), the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] = 0`), and we predict `0` (**Holyfield**).

- **Function Output:**
  - **prediction**: The predicted class label (`0` for Holyfield, `1` for Lewis).
  - **nodes**: A list containing the truth value (`1` or `0`) of the condition in the decision node.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Example input where the judge is an official judge
X_example = {
    "Judge": 2,        # S. Christodoulu
    "Official": 1,     # Yes
    "Round": 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [1]

# Example input where the judge is not an official judge
X_example = {
    "Judge": 3,        # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,     # No
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 0, Nodes: [0]
```

**Notes:**

- **Feature Importance Justification:**
  - The **Official** feature is chosen because official judges' scores are decisive in determining the official outcome of each round. Therefore, it is considered the most important feature for this classifier.
  
- **Thresholds and Conditions:**
  - Since **Official** is a binary categorical feature, the condition is a simple equality check rather than a threshold comparison.
  - The function checks whether the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).

- **Compliance with Provided Encodings and Keys:**
  - The function uses the exact keys and encodings as specified:
    - **Keys**: `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, `'Round'`.
    - **Encodings**:
      - **Official**: `1` for Yes, `0` for No.
      - **Target**: `1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield.

- **Maximum Depth Constraint:**
  - The decision tree has only one decision node (depth of 1), as required.

**Summary:**

The provided `predict` function implements a simple decision tree classifier that predicts whether **Lewis** or **Holyfield** won a round based solely on whether the judge is an official judge. It returns the prediction along with a list indicating whether the condition in the decision node was satisfied.
