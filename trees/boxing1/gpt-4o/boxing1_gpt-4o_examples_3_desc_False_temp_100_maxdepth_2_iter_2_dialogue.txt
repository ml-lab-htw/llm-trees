Based on your request and the data provided, here is a Python function to predict the winner of a boxing round between Lewis and Holyfield using a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. The function also returns a list of truth values corresponding to the inner node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Define the decision conditions at each node
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 7]  # E. Williams, S. Christodoulu, Associated Press
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 0       # Official judge is "No"
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "Judge": 1,      # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 3
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print("Prediction:", "Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

Explanation:
- The `Judge` feature is compared against the judges known to favor Lewis based on the provided examples, E. Williams (0), S. Christodoulu (2), and Associated Press (7).
- The `Official` judge condition checks if the judge is not an official (0). This condition checks the key boolean split based on the second node.
- The `Round` feature is not used within this depth-2 decision tree since our constraints limit focus primarily to `Judge` and `Official`.

In the example usage given the input features:
```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 1,      # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,   # Yes
    "Round": 3
}
```
- Since `Judge` is L. O'Connell (1) and not in the set [0, 2, 7], `nodes[0]` will be False.
- `Official` is Yes (1), thus not satisfying `nodes[1]` condition of `0` (no), making `nodes[1]` False.

As a result, according to the decision tree logic, the prediction will be `0` (Holyfield), and the nodes array would be `[0, 0]`.
