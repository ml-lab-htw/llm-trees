To create a function that implements the decision tree and returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes, first, let's map the features to their respective indices. Here's the function implementation based on the given example:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Checking the official judge condition
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1

    # Checking the round condition
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Checking the judge condition for rounds 1-6
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 3, 4, 6, 9]  # E. Williams, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Sportsline, Boxing Monthly-Leach

    # Checking the judge condition for rounds 7-12
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach

    if nodes[0]:  # If Official = Yes
        if nodes[1]:  # If Round <= 6
            if X["Judge"] == 0:  # E. Williams
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 1:  # L. O'Connell
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 2:  # S. Christodoulu
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 4:  # Sportsticker
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # Boxing Times
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 6:  # Sportsline
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 8:  # ESPN
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 9:  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield

        else:  # If Round > 6
            if X["Judge"] == 0:  # E. Williams
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 1:  # L. O'Connell
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 2:  # S. Christodoulu
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 4:  # Sportsticker
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # Boxing Times
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 6:  # Sportsline
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 8:  # ESPN
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif X["Judge"] == 9:  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
                prediction = 1  # Lewis

    else:  # If Official = No
        prediction = 0

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X_example = {
    "Judge": 8,  # ESPN
    "Official": 1,  # Yes
    "Round": 8
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `predict(X)` processes the input dictionary `X`, which contains values for "Judge", "Official", and "Round".
2. We initialize a list `nodes` to keep track of the conditions at each node in the decision tree.
3. The first condition checks if the judge is official.
4. If the judge is official, the tree further checks the round to determine how to branch.
5. Depending on the round number (1-6 or 7-12) and the judge, it makes a prediction based on the predefined mappings.

This function returns the prediction and a list of boolean values representing whether each nodeâ€™s condition in the decision tree was satisfied.
