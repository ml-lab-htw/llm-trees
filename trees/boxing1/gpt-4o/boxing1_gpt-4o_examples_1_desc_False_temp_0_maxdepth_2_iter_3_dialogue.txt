Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - 'Judge': int (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, ..., 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - 'Official': int (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': int (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction: int (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
        - nodes: list of int (truth values of the inner nodes, 1 if condition is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is E. Williams (Judge == 0)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is E. Williams
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is official (Official == 1)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # If Judge is not E. Williams
        # Node 1: Check if the round is in the first half (Round <= 6)
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Features**:
   - `Judge`: Encoded as integers (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, ..., 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach).
   - `Official`: Encoded as integers (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
   - `Round`: Integer values from 1 to 12.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is E. Williams (`Judge == 0`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it either checks if the judge is official (`Official == 1`) or if the round is in the first half (`Round <= 6`).

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the judge is E. Williams and is an official judge, the prediction is `1` (Lewis).
   - If the judge is E. Williams but not an official judge, the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).
   - If the judge is not E. Williams and the round is in the first half, the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).
   - If the judge is not E. Williams and the round is in the second half, the prediction is `1` (Lewis).

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 0,       # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, True]
```

### Another Example:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # No
    "Round": 8        # Round 8
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [False, False]
```
