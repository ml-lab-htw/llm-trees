Given the Features (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and target variable (`target`), I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 and between 3 to 7 inner nodes. Since we are not training the tree on actual data, I will create a hypothetical logic based on the feature descriptions.

### Explanation of the decision tree structure:
- **Judge**: Different judges may have different tendencies, so this could be an important factor.
- **Official**: Whether the judge was an official judge or not might influence their scoring.
- **Round**: As rounds progress, one fighter might dominate more, so the round number could matter.

### The Decision Tree:
The tree will make decisions based on these features, and after evaluating the conditions, it will predict whether Lewis or Holyfield won the round.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Does the round number affect the outcome?
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Is the judge one of the first four judges (which might indicate a different scoring pattern)?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 3
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Is the judge an official?
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        # Node 1: Is the judge from ESPN or Boxing Monthly-Leach?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] >= 8
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            # Node 2: Is the judge an official?
            nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Logic:
1. **First Decision (Node 0)**: If the round is 6 or earlier, we assume the early rounds are more evenly matched, and we look at the judges' tendencies.
   - If the round is in the first 6 rounds (`Round <= 6`), we proceed to check which judge is scoring the round.
   
2. **Second Decision (Node 1)**: We split based on whether the judge is one of the first four listed (`Judge <= 3`), which could indicate a preference pattern.
   - For earlier rounds, if the judge is an official (`Official == 1`), Lewis wins; otherwise, Holyfield wins.
   - If the judge is not one of the first four, Holyfield is predicted to win.
   
3. **Second Branch (for rounds after 6)**: If the round is later (`Round > 6`), we expect the fight to be more one-sided.
   - If the judge is ESPN or Boxing Monthly-Leach (`Judge >= 8`), Lewis wins.
   - Otherwise, if the judge is official, Holyfield wins; if not, Lewis wins.

### Example Usage:

1. **Input**:
   ```python
   X = {"Judge": 2, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
   ```

   **Output**:
   ```python
   predict(X)
   # Returns: (1, [True, True, True])  # Lewis wins, all conditions satisfied
   ```

2. **Input**:
   ```python
   X = {"Judge": 9, "Official": 0, "Round": 8}
   ```

   **Output**:
   ```python
   predict(X)
   # Returns: (1, [False, True, None])  # Lewis wins, first condition false, second condition true
   ```

### Summary:
This function predicts which fighter won the round based on the `Judge`, whether the judge was an `Official`, and the `Round`. It returns both the prediction and a list of truth values indicating which conditions were satisfied during the decision-making process.
