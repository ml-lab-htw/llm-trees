### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the exact feature names you provided (`"Judge"`, `"Official"`, `"Round"`).
- The function evaluates each internal node of the decision tree.
  - **Node 0** checks if the score is from an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
  - **Node 1** checks either:
    - If the judge is one of the official judges E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu (when the score is from an official source).
    - Or, if the round is in the early half (Rounds 1 to 6) when the score is from an unofficial source.
- The final prediction is based on these two conditions:
  - **1** means Lewis won the round.
  - **0** means Holyfield won the round.
