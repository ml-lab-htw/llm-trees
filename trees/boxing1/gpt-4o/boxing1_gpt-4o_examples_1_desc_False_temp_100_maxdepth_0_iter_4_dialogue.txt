### Explanation:
- **Nodes Initialization**: A list `nodes` is initialized to store the truth values of the inner nodes. There are two inner nodes, so `nodes` is initialized with a length of 2.
  
- **Node 0 (Root Node)**: The first decision is whether the judge is an **official judge** (`X["Official"] == 1`). This checks if the "Official" field is equal to 1 (Yes).
  
- **Node 1 (Left Branch)**: If the judge is an official judge (i.e., `nodes[0]` is `True`), the second decision checks whether the judge is one of the three official judges: **E. Williams (0), L. O'Connell (1), or S. Christodoulu (2)**. If so, the prediction is **Lewis (1)**; otherwise, it's **Holyfield (0)**.
  
- **Node 1 (Right Branch)**: If the judge is not an official judge (i.e., `nodes[0]` is `False`), the second decision checks whether the judge is from HBO-Lederman (3), Sportsline (6), or Boxing Monthly-Leach (9). If so, the prediction is **Holyfield (0)**. Otherwise, it's **Lewis (1)**.

The function returns the predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield) along with the `nodes` list, which contains the truth values of the inner nodes.
