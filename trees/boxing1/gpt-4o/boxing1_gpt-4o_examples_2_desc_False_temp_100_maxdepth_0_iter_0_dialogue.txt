Certainly! I will formulate a Python function based on the provided decision tree along with the specific feature keys and target encoding, while also returning the inner node truth values.

Here is the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 9 * [None]  # Adjust the number based on the number of inner nodes

    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] == 0)    # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = (X["Round"] <= 6)
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] == 1)    # L. O'Connell
    nodes[3] = (X["Official"] == 1)
    nodes[4] = (X["Judge"] == 2)    # S. Christodoulu
    nodes[5] = (X["Round"] <= 8)
    nodes[6] = (X["Judge"] == 4)    # Sportsticker
    nodes[7] = (X["Round"] <= 4)
    nodes[8] = (X["Judge"] == 6)    # Sportsline

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[2]:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[4]:
        if nodes[5]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[6]:
        if nodes[7]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # Boxing Times
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[8]:
        if nodes[3]:
            if X["Round"] <= 5:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif X["Judge"] == 8:  # ESPN
        prediction = 1  # Lewis 
    elif X["Judge"] == 9:  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Default to Holyfield in case of errors

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3}
print(predict(features))
# Output should be (0, [1, 1, 0, Noe, 0, None, 0, None, 0])
```

This function `predict()` takes a dictionary `X` which contains values for 'Judge', 'Official', and 'Round' as inputs. It processes these inputs against the decision tree conditions, and returns the final prediction whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the given round, alongside a list of truth values from each inner node in the decision tree. The inner node list helps trace how the prediction was made by showing which conditions were satisfied.

Feel free to adjust the implementation to better fit specific details or include additional logic if the problem domain you are working on needs it.
