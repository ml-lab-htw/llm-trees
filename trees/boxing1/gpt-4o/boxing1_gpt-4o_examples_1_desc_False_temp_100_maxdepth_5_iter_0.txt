Here's a new decision tree based on the provided features (`Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`) with a maximum depth of 5, formatted as a Python function that makes a prediction about which fighter won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield). The function will also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Decision tree conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Distinguish between certain judges
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Whether the judge is an official or not
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Distinguish between early and late rounds
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # Specific judge groups
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] % 2 == 0  # Even versus odd rounds
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: Checks whether the `Judge` is one of the first five judges (`Judge <= 4`).
- **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is an official (`Official == 1`).
- **Node 2**: Checks if the round is in the first half (`Round <= 6`).
- **Node 3**: Checks if the judge belongs to a specific subset (`Judge` is one of `[0, 1, 2]`).
- **Node 4**: Checks if the round number is even (`Round % 2 == 0`).

This decision tree uses the most relevant features to predict whether Lewis or Holyfield won a round, and the return value includes both the prediction and the truth values of the decision nodes.

### Example:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 1,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 3
}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True, True, True, False]
```
