Given your requirements, I've created a Python function that implements a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2 to classify rounds won by either Lewis or Holyfield based on the features "Judge", "Official", and "Round." The function returns a single prediction as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split based on whether the judge is official or not
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second split based on the specific judge when the judge is official
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes


# Example usage:
data_example = {
    "Judge": 1,       # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round number (though Round is not used in this tree)
}

prediction, nodes = predict(data_example)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Explanation:
1. **nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1**: This node checks if the judge is an official judge.
2. **nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]**: If the judge is official, this node checks if the judge is either E. Williams (0), L. O'Connell (1), or S. Christodoulu (2).
3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If **nodes[0]** is `False` (the judge is not official), the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).
   - If **nodes[0]** is `True` and **nodes[1]** is `True` (the judge is either E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu), the prediction is `1` (Lewis).
   - If **nodes[1]** is `False` (the judge is any other official judge), the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).

This example respects the requirements and gives a simple, yet structured approach for decision making in a boxing match context.
