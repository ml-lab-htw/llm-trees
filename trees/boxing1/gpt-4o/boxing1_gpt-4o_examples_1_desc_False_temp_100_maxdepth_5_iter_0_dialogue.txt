The feature names exactly match the formats you provided, and the function returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]  # We have 5 inner nodes in this decision tree.
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        # Node 2: Check which official judge is scoring
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 1  # L. O'Connell
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is L. O'Connell
            # Node 3: Check the round number
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # If the judge is not L. O'Connell
            # Node 4: Is the judge E. Williams?
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 5: Check the round number
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 4
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 1 if X["Judge"] == 2 else 0  # S. Christodoulu -> Lewis, others -> Holyfield
    else:  # If it's not an official judge
        # Node 6: Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 7: Check the round number
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            # Node 8: Check if the judge is Sportsticker
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 4  # Sportsticker
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 9: Check the round number
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 8
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                # Other non-official judges
                if X["Judge"] == 5:  # Boxing Times
                    prediction = 1 if X["Round"] <= 6 else 0  # Lewis if round <= 6, else Holyfield
                elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                elif X["Judge"] == 8:  # ESPN
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

1. **Input Format**: The function takes a dictionary `X` with the following keys:
   - `"Judge"` (integer, from 0 to 9)
   - `"Official"` (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No")
   - `"Round"` (integer, from 1 to 12)

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Check if the judge is an official judge.
   - `nodes[1]`, `nodes[2]`, etc.: Subsequent nodes check the identity of the judge and the round number.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The function predicts either `1` (Lewis) or `0` (Holyfield) based on the conditions in the decision tree.
   
4. **Returned Values**:
   - The function returns the prediction (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield) and a list representing the truth values of the decision tree's inner nodes (`nodes`).

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function can now be used to evaluate individual rounds based on the judge, whether the judge is official, and the round number.
