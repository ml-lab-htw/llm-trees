Based on the Features and target variable (which boxer won the round, either Lewis or Holyfield), I will construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. Since the decision tree can only have one inner node, we will base the decision on a single, most important feature.

In this case, I'll use the feature **Judge** as the inner node, as different judges might have different scoring tendencies. This is a simplified decision tree for demonstration purposes, and it assumes that certain judges are more likely to favor one fighter over the other.

Here is the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    # Inner node: judge's identity
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 3, 5]  # Assume these judges tend to favor Lewis for simplicity.
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The inner node checks if the judge is one of the judges who are more likely to favor Lewis (indices 0, 1, 3, 5 corresponding to **E. Williams**, **L. O'Connell**, **HBO-Lederman**, and **Boxing Times**).
- If the condition is satisfied (i.e., the judge is one of those), the prediction is that **Lewis** wins the round.
- Otherwise, the prediction is that **Holyfield** wins the round.
  
The function returns:
- **prediction**: the predicted winner of the round (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield).
- **nodes**: a list of truth values indicating whether the conditions of the inner nodes are satisfied. In this case, it only has one value (1 or 0) based on the judge condition.
