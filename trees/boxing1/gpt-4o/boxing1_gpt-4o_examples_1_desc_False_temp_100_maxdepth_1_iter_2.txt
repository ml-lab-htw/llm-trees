Based on the Features you provided (`Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`), I will generate a decision tree classifier of depth 1. Since I'm not training it on actual data, I'll make an assumption about the most important feature for this decision tree. Let's assume that the most important feature affecting the outcome of a round is whether the judge is an official judge (`Official`), as official judges are more likely to adhere to standard scoring criteria.

Hereâ€™s the Python function for the decision tree of depth 1:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Inner Node (`nodes[0]`)**: The condition we are checking is whether `Official` is equal to 1 (i.e., the judge is an official judge). This is the only decision point in this tree.
- **Prediction**:
  - If the judge is official (`Official == 1`), the prediction is that **Lewis** wins the round (prediction = 1).
  - If the judge is not official (`Official == 0`), the prediction is that **Holyfield** wins the round (prediction = 0).
  
This decision tree is simple, with only one inner node, as per your requirement. It considers the "Official" feature as the most important factor determining the outcome of the round.
