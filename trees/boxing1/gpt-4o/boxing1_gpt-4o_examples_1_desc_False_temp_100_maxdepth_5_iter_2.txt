Sure! Let's construct a decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 for the new feature set and the target variable `target` (which indicates which fighter won the round). Given that the features include the judge, whether the judge is official, and which round it is, I'll create a decision tree that uses these features for making a prediction.

Here is the tree construction:

### Features:
- **Judge**: The identity of the judge scoring the round (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, etc.).
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Round**: The round number (1 to 12).

### Target:
- **target**: Which of the two boxers won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes, 5 inner nodes for a decision tree of depth 5
    nodes = 5 * [None]

    # Define conditions for the nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Check if the judge is one of the first five judges
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Check if the round number is 6 or below
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Check if the judge is E. Williams
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] > 9  # Check if the round number is higher than 9

    # Build the decision tree structure based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
- **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is one of the first five judges (`Judge <= 4`). Judges with values 0 to 4 are used in one branch, and judges 5 to 9 are used in another.
- **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is an official (`Official == 1`). Official judges may have different decision tendencies from unofficial ones.
- **Node 2**: Checks if the round is early (`Round <= 6`), as rounds early in the fight may be scored differently from later rounds.
- **Node 3**: Checks if the judge is E. Williams specifically (`Judge == 0`), to account for any specific tendencies this judge may have.
- **Node 4**: Checks if the round is very late (`Round > 9`), as late rounds could have different dynamics.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input features
X = {
    "Judge": 3,        # Judge is HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 1,     # The judge is official
    "Round": 10        # It is the 10th round
}

# Call the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # 1: Lewis, 0: Holyfield
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # The truth values for each node in the decision tree
```

This function will return the prediction of which fighter won the round (Lewis = 1, Holyfield = 0) based on the input features, along with a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the conditions at each inner node.
