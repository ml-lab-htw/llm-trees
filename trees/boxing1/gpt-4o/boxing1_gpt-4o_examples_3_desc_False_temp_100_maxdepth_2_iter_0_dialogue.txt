Sure! Let's create a function based on the given decision tree for predicting whether Lewis or Holyfield won a round. The function should also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes of the tree. We'll use meaningful thresholds based on the context provided.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None] * 2
    
    # Node 0: Check if Official judge is 'yes'
    nodes[0] = X['Official'] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check the specific Judge
        if X['Judge'] == 0:  # E. Williams
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif X['Judge'] == 1:  # L. O'Connell
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif X['Judge'] == 2:  # S. Christodoulu
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif X['Judge'] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif X['Judge'] == 4:  # Sportsticker
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif X['Judge'] == 5:  # Boxing Times
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif X['Judge'] == 6:  # Sportsline
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif X['Judge'] == 7:  # Associated Press
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif X['Judge'] == 8:  # ESPN
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif X['Judge'] == 9:  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Default to Holyfield if judge not recognized
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if Round is <= 6
        nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: The function first checks if the judge is an official judge (`X['Official'] == 1`).
2. **Node 1 (if official)**: If the judge is official, it checks the specific `Judge` value and makes a prediction based on the given mapping.
3. **Node 1 (if not official)**: If the judge is not official, it checks if the `Round` is less than or equal to 6 (`X['Round'] <= 6`).

### How to Use:
For example, if you have a data point like:
```python
X = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function would return `prediction = 0` (Holyfield) and `nodes = [1, None]`, meaning the features followed the path where the judge is official and is L. O'Connell, leading to a prediction of Holyfield winning the round.
