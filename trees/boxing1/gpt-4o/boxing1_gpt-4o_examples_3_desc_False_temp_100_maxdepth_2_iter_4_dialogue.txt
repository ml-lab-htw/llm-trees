Based on your specifications and the given format, here’s the Python function for the decision tree classifier that predicts which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis or Holyfield, encoded as 1 and 0 respectively) won each round. The function also returns a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is an official judge.
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman.
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
example_input = {
    "Judge": 3,  # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,  # no
    "Round": 3  # Round 3 (though not used in this simple example tree)
}
prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

Here’s how this function works:

1. The first check (`nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1`) examines if the judge is an official judge.
2. If the first condition (node 0) is `True` (i.e., the judge is an official judge), the prediction is "Lewis" (1).
3. If the first condition is `False` (i.e., the judge is not an official judge), the second check (`nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3`) examines if the judge is HBO-Lederman.
4. If this second condition (node 1) is `True`, the prediction is "Holyfield" (0).
5. If both conditions are `False`, the prediction is also "Holyfield" (0).

This function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values of the nodes. Note, however, that this example uses a very simplified tree and might not reflect the complexity that a more extensive dataset would offer.
