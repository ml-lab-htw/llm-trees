Certainly! Below is the Python function that implements a decision tree with your specified features, formatted according to your instructions. I've used the "Judge" feature as the main criterion for classification, and filled in the conditions to split between Lewis and Holyfield.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Inner node (only one split)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 3, 7]  # Judges: E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Associated Press
    
    # Decision based on the inner node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
1. **Input:** The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (`"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"`) and the values are the values for each feature.
2. **Inner node:** 
   - The inner node checks if the `"Judge"` value is in the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 7]`, which corresponds to the judges: E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, and Associated Press.
3. **Prediction:**
   - If the condition in the inner node is satisfied (i.e., the judge is one of those listed), the function predicts **1** (Lewis wins).
   - Otherwise, the function predicts **0** (Holyfield wins).
4. **Truth values list:** The list `nodes` contains the result of evaluating the inner node condition (1 if true, 0 if false).

This is a max-depth 1 decision tree function that classifies based on the "Judge" feature and returns both the prediction and the truth value of the inner node.
