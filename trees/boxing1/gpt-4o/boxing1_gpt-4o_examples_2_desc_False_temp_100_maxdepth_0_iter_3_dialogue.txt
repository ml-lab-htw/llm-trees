Based on your requirements and the provided context, here is a decision tree function implemented in Python that returns a single prediction for the fighter that won each round along with a list representing the truth values for the inner nodes. The function considers the given features and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]

    # Nodes definition: terms used based on the previous decision tree
    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] == 0)  # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = (X["Round"] <= 6.5)
    nodes[2] = (X["Judge"] == 1)  # L. O'Connell
    nodes[3] = (X["Round"] <= 3.5)
    nodes[4] = (X["Official"] == 1)  # Official judge
    nodes[5] = (X["Judge"] == 9)  # Boxing Monthly-Leach
    nodes[6] = (X["Round"] <= 7.5)

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[2]:
        if nodes[3]:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif X["Judge"] == 2:  # S. Christodoulu
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
        if X["Round"] <= 4.5:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif X["Judge"] == 4:  # Sportsticker
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif X["Judge"] == 5:  # Boxing Times
        if X["Round"] <= 5.5:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif X["Judge"] == 6:  # Sportsline
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif X["Judge"] == 8:  # ESPN
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[5]:
        if nodes[6]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
features = {
    'Judge': 1,
    'Official': 1,
    'Round': 4
}

print(predict(features))  # Should output the prediction and the node conditions list
```

In this function:
- The `nodes` list captures the truth values of the inner nodes.
- The decision process is based on the splits provided in your previous description.
- The thresholds have been filled with meaningful values extracted from the specified decision tree logic, ensuring they correspond correctly to each condition. 

Each index of the `nodes` list corresponds to a particular decision point in the tree. The function output includes both the prediction (`1` for Lewis and `0` for Holyfield) and the list of conditions. This should meet the requirements you've set forth in your request.
