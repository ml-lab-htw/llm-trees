Given the Features and target variable, I will create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3 using important features to predict which fighter won the round. The decision tree will have between 3 and 7 inner nodes, and I will format it as a Python function that returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here is the decision tree:

### Decision Tree

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the Judge is one who tends to favor Lewis (arbitrary selection of judges)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 2, 4, 7]  # Judges E. Williams, S. Christodoulu, Sportsticker, Associated Press
    
    # Node 2: Check if the round number is 6 or greater (could be important in later rounds)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] >= 6
    
    # Node 3: Check if the judge is an official judge (official judges might score differently)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:

1. **Node 1 (`nodes[0]`)**: If the judge is from a set of judges who tend to favor Lewis based on their past scoring behavior (arbitrary selection: Judges 0, 2, 4, 7), then this condition is satisfied.
   
2. **Node 2 (`nodes[1]`)**: If the round is 6 or greater, it checks if we are in a later round, where the dynamics of the fight may shift. This condition helps determine the impact of later rounds on scoring.
   
3. **Node 3 (`nodes[2]`)**: If the judge is an "official" judge (1 = Yes), the scoring behavior might be different from unofficial judges.

### Predictions based on conditions:
- If the judge tends to favor Lewis and the round is 6 or greater, the prediction is that **Lewis** wins the round.
- If the judge tends to favor Lewis but the round is earlier (less than 6), then **Holyfield** wins the round.
- If the judge does not tend to favor Lewis but is an official judge, then **Lewis** wins the round.
- If the judge does not tend to favor Lewis and is not an official judge, then **Holyfield** wins the round.

### Example usage:

```python
X = {"Judge": 7, "Official": 1, "Round": 8}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will return:
```
Prediction: Lewis, Nodes: [True, True, True]
```
