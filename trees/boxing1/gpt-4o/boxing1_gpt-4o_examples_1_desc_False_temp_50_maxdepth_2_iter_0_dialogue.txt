Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting whether Lewis or Holyfield won the round. It adheres to the given feature keys, target encoding, and example format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts which boxing fighter (Lewis or Holyfield) won the round based on the input features.

    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
            - "Judge" (int): 0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 
                            3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 
                            6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 
                            9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach
            - "Official" (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
            - "Round" (int): Round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 = condition satisfied, 0 = not satisfied) 
                            for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize the list to store truth values of inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the judge is one of [E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Associated Press, ESPN]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2, 7, 8]

    # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1

    # Make the prediction based on the decision tree
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
Hereâ€™s how you can use the `predict` function:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 0,        # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,     # Yes (official judge)
    "Round": 5         # Round 5
}

# Get prediction and inner node truth values
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Lewis wins)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: [1, 1]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is one of the specified judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, Associated Press, ESPN). This is based on the assumption that these judges may favor Lewis more often.
2. **Node 1**: Checks if the judge is an official judge. Official judges may have a different scoring tendency compared to unofficial ones.
3. **Leaf Nodes**: Based on the results of the above conditions, the prediction is made for either Lewis (`1`) or Holyfield (`0`).

This decision tree is simple with a maximum depth of 2, as requested, and follows the structure you provided. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!
