### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the conditions (inner nodes of the decision tree). Each entry corresponds to a condition being evaluated.
- **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is an official (`X["Official"] == 1`).
- **Node 1**: If the judge is official, it checks if the judge is one of {E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu} (mapped to 0, 1, 2). If not official, it checks if the judge is one of {HBO-Lederman, ESPN} (mapped to 3, 8).
- **Node 2**: If the judge is official and one of {E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}, it checks if the round is in the first half (Rounds 1-6). If the judge is unofficial and not HBO-Lederman/ESPN, it checks if the round is in the first half (Rounds 1-5).
- **Prediction**: Based on the conditions, the function returns which fighter won the round: `1 = Lewis`, `0 = Holyfield`.

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
# Output: Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True, True]
