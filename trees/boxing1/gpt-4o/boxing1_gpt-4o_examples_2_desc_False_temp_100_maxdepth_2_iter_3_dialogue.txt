Based on the specified features and the desired maximum depth of 2 for the decision tree, here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initializing the list for storing node truth values
    
    # Conditions for the decision tree
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1]  # Checking if the judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell (official judges with predicted output for Lewis)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is E. Williams or L. O'Connell
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (assuming the only other official judge in example was S. Christodoulu)
    else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield (assuming the only other non-official judge in example was Sportsticker)
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
features = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
print(predict(features)) # Expected output: (1, [True, True])
```

Explanation:

1. **Nodes initialization**: `nodes = 2 * [None]` initializes the list with two `None` values, `nodes[0]` and `nodes[1]`, to store the results of the inner node conditions.
2. **Conditions**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (1 for yes).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the official judge is either E. Williams (0) or L. O'Connell (1), suggesting a pattern specific to these judges based on the example tree structure.
3. **Decision Tree Logic**:
   - First, check if the judge is an official judge using `nodes[0]`.
   - If the judge is official (`nodes[0]` is True), check for specific judges E. Williams or L. O'Connell.
   - If the judge is not official (`nodes[0]` is False), decide based on the non-official judge HBO-Lederman.

This function returns the prediction along with the truth value list representing the decision path taken within the tree.
