Let's format the decision tree classifier as a Python function using the provided feature keys and target values. The function will return a single prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) as well as a list of boolean values that represent the truth values of the internal nodes.

Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in {1, 2}  # L. O'Connell or S. Christodoulu

    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Official Judge == yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge == E. Williams
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            elif nodes[3]:  # Judge in {L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Judge not in {E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Official Judge == no
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Round > 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Official Judge == yes
            if nodes[2]:  # Judge == E. Williams
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            elif nodes[3]:  # Judge in {L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:  # Judge not in {E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Official Judge == no
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
sample_input = {
    "Judge": 1,       # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(sample_input)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **`nodes[0]`**: Checks if the round is 6 or less.
2. **`nodes[1]`**: Checks if the judge is official (yes).
3. **`nodes[2]`**: Checks if the judge is E. Williams.
4. **`nodes[3]`**: Checks if the judge is either L. O'Connell or S. Christodoulu.

### Workflow:
- The function first examines the round to see if it's 6 or less (`nodes[0]`).
- If the round is 6 or less:
  - It checks if the judge is official (`nodes[1]`).
  - For official judges, it further narrows down by the specific judge (`nodes[2]` and `nodes[3]`).
  - If conditions for these judges are not met, a default prediction for Holyfield is provided.
- If the round is more than 6:
  - It again checks if the judge is official (`nodes[1]`).
  - For official judges, it checks specific judges and assigns predictions accordingly.
- If the judge is not official regardless of the round, the predictions for early and later rounds differ.

This structure helps in making decisions based on defined criteria and also outputs node conditions to gain insights into how decisions were made.
