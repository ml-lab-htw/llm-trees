Sure, let's create the Python function following similar patterns to your examples. Our function will include the decision tree we derived earlier. Here's the code:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Judge == E. Williams (0) / L. O'Connell (1) / S. Christodoulu (2)
    judges_for_first_condition = {0, 1, 2}
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in judges_for_first_condition

    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
    
# Example usage:
# Features: ['Judge', 'Official', 'Round']
X = {
    'Judge': 3,      # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 1,   # Yes
    'Round': 7       # Round 7
}

print(predict(X))  # Should return (1, [False, True]) assuming the given example would predict Lewis as winner
```

Explanation:
- `nodes[0]` evaluates whether the "Judge" is one of E. Williams (0), L. O'Connell (1), or S. Christodoulu (2).
- If this condition is met (`nodes[0]` is True), we then proceed to check if the "Round" is less than or equal to 6.
- Otherwise (`nodes[0]` is False), we check whether the "Official" is Yes (1).
- The values of nodes and the prediction are returned as per the decision tree derived.

You can test the function using different feature values to see if the predictions and node evaluations align with the rules specified in the decision tree.
