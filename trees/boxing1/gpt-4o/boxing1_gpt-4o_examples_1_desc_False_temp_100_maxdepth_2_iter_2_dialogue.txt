```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 1: If Official = Yes, check if Judge is one of the official judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu)
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        # Node 1: If Official = No, check if the round is <= 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks whether the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`). If true, we move to Node 1 to see if the specific judge is one of the three official judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu).
- **Node 1**:
  - If **official**, the function checks if the judge is one of the official judges, and assigns the prediction accordingly.
  - If **not official**, the function checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6, and sets the prediction based on the round number.
  
### Example usage:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # Not an official judge
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this case, the output will be:
```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False, True]
```

This means the prediction is **Holyfield** (0), and the list `[False, True]` indicates that the first condition (whether the judge is official) was false, and the second condition (whether the round is <= 6) was true.
