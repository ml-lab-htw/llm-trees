Here is a decision tree of depth 4, based on the Features and target variable you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of the top 3 (Williams, O'Connell, or Christodoulu)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    
    # Node 2: Check if the round number is greater than 6 (later rounds might favor one fighter more)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    # Node 3: Check if the judge is official (official judges might have different scoring tendencies)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 4: Check if the round is an even number (some rounds may have different scoring patterns)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] % 2 == 0

    # Decision tree based on the above conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # If judge is in [Williams, O'Connell, Christodoulu]
        if nodes[1]:  # If round is greater than 6
            if nodes[2]:  # If judge is official
                if nodes[3]:  # If round is even
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:  # Judge is unofficial 
                if nodes[3]:  # If round is even
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # Round is 6 or less
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                if nodes[3]:  # Even round
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:  # Unofficial judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # Judge is not one of the top 3 (other judges)
        if nodes[1]:  # Round is greater than 6
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                if nodes[3]:  # Even round
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:  # Unofficial judge
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # Round is 6 or less
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **nodes[0]**: The first decision checks if the judge is one of the top 3 (Williams, O'Connell, or Christodoulu). This might be important because these judges may have different scoring patterns.
- **nodes[1]**: The second decision checks if the round number is greater than 6. Later rounds might be scored differently due to fighter fatigue or strategy changes.
- **nodes[2]**: The third decision checks if the judge is official. Official judges may have more consistent scoring criteria.
- **nodes[3]**: The fourth decision checks if the round is an even number. There may be round-based patterns in scores across even and odd rounds.

This decision tree provides a simple heuristic for predicting which fighter won the round based on the features provided.
