Here is the Python function for the decision tree you described, formatted to return a single prediction and a list of truth values for the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield) based on the given features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - 'Judge': int (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, ..., 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - 'Official': int (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': int (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: (prediction, nodes)
        - prediction: int (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
        - nodes: list of int (1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge == 3 (HBO-Lederman)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is HBO-Lederman
        # Node 1: Official == 1 (Yes)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # If Official is Yes
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # If Official is No
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # If Judge is not HBO-Lederman
        # Node 1: Round <= 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # If Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # If Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Features**:
   - `Judge`: Encoded as integers (0 to 9).
   - `Official`: Encoded as 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
   - `Round`: Integer values from 1 to 12.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is "HBO-Lederman" (`Judge == 3`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it either checks if the judge is official (`Official == 1`) or if the round is less than or equal to 6 (`Round <= 6`).

3. **Prediction**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is true (Judge is HBO-Lederman), the decision depends on whether the judge is official.
   - If `nodes[0]` is false (Judge is not HBO-Lederman), the decision depends on the round number.

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes, where 1 indicates the condition is satisfied and 0 indicates it is not.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 7        # Round 7
}

# Predict
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1]
```

### Example Explanation:
- `nodes[0] = 1` because `Judge == 3` (HBO-Lederman).
- `nodes[1] = 1` because `Official == 1` (Yes).
- Since both conditions are satisfied, the prediction is `1` (Lewis).
