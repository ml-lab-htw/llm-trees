Given the Features (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and a Target variable (`target` which indicates whether Lewis won the round), I will generate a decision tree of depth 4. The tree will use logical conditions based on the provided features, without actual training on data.

Here is the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes based on feature values
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Split based on the halfway point of a 12-round match
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Whether the judge is an official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Split the judges into two broad groups (0-4 and 5-9)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 3  # Further split based on early rounds (1-3)

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Early or mid-rounds (1-6)
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Group of judges 0-4
                if nodes[3]:  # Very early rounds (1-3)
                    prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins early rounds with officials from group 0-4
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins mid-rounds with officials from group 0-4
            else:  # Group of judges 5-9
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins early rounds with officials from group 5-9
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins mid-rounds with officials from group 5-9
        else:  # Non-official judge
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins early rounds with non-officials
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins mid-rounds with non-officials
    else:  # Late rounds (7-12)
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # Group of judges 0-4
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins early late rounds with officials from group 0-4
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins late rounds with officials from group 0-4
            else:  # Group of judges 5-9
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins early late rounds with officials from group 5-9
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins late rounds with officials from group 5-9
        else:  # Non-official judge
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins early late rounds with non-officials
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins late rounds with non-officials

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Decision Tree:
1. **`nodes[0]`:** The tree first splits based on whether the round is in the early to mid rounds (1-6) or the late rounds (7-12).
2. **`nodes[1]`:** Then it checks if the judge is an official judge or not.
3. **`nodes[2]`:** Further splits based on the group of judges (0-4 as one group, 5-9 as another).
4. **`nodes[3]`:** Finally, it checks if the round is in the very early rounds (1-3) or not.

### Output:
- **`prediction`:** The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
- **`nodes`:** A list of truth values representing the conditions at the inner nodes.

This is a manually crafted decision tree based on the provided feature set, with a depth of 4 and logical splits that are plausible for such a problem.
