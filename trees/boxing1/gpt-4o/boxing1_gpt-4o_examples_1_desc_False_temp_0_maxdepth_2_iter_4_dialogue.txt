Here is the Python function for your decision tree classifier based on the features `['Judge', 'Official', 'Round']` and the target variable (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield) based on the input features.

    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - 'Judge': Judge (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
                        4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 
                        8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
        - 'Official': Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        - 'Round': Round number (1 to 12)

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): The predicted winner (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values (1 if the condition of the corresponding inner node is satisfied, 0 otherwise)
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]  # Initialize a list to store the truth values of the inner nodes

    # Node 0: Check if the Judge is E. Williams (0)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0

    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is E. Williams
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is official
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # If the judge is not official
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # If Judge is not E. Williams
        # Node 1: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # If the round number is <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # If the round number is > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Features**:
   - `Judge`: Encoded as integers (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, etc.).
   - `Official`: Encoded as binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
   - `Round`: Integer values from 1 to 12.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is E. Williams (`X["Judge"] == 0`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Depending on the result of `nodes[0]`, it either checks if the judge is official (`X["Official"] == 1`) or if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`).

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If the judge is E. Williams and is an official judge, Lewis wins.
   - If the judge is E. Williams but is not an official judge, Holyfield wins.
   - If the judge is not E. Williams and the round number is less than or equal to 6, Holyfield wins.
   - If the judge is not E. Williams and the round number is greater than 6, Lewis wins.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 0,       # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [1, 1]
```

### Another Example:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # No
    "Round": 7        # Round 7
}

# Make a prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [0, 0]
```
