Here's the Python function based on the decision tree we discussed earlier. It uses the exact keys of the features and encodes the target variable as requested. The thresholds are chosen based on our knowledge of the boxing domain.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge == HBO-Lederman (3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Official judge == No (0)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Round <= 6
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (if HBO-Lederman is official)
            
    else:
        # Node 3: Judge == Sportsline (6)
        nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 6
        
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Official judge == Yes (1)
            nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
            
            if nodes[1]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                # Node 5: Round <= 7
                nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 7
                
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            # Node 6: Judge == Associated Press (7)
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 7
            
            if nodes[3]:
                # Node 7: Official judge == Yes (1)
                nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
                
                if nodes[1]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                else:
                    # Node 8: Round <= 5
                    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 5
                    
                    if nodes[2]:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins (for other judges)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- `X` is the input dictionary that contains the features: `"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"`.
  
- The `nodes` list holds the truth values of the conditions at each decision node. Each element in `nodes` corresponds to whether a particular condition is satisfied or not (1 if true, 0 if false).

- The tree first checks if the judge is **HBO-Lederman** (Judge == 3), then checks if they are an **official** judge or not, and finally checks the round number to determine the winner.

- If the judge is not **HBO-Lederman**, it checks for **Sportsline** (Judge == 6) or **Associated Press** (Judge == 7), and similar logic applies from there.

- Finally, if none of the specified judges are present, **Holyfield** is predicted as the winner.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input: Judge is HBO-Lederman, not an official judge, round 7
X = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 0,
    "Round": 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: Prediction: 0 (Holyfield)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: Nodes: [True, True, False, None]
```

This function allows you to predict the winner of each round based on the judge, official status, and round number, and also returns the path taken through the decision tree.
