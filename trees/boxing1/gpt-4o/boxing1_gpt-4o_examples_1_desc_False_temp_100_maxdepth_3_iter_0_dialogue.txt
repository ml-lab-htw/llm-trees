The feature names exactly match the formats you provided, and the function returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # We have 4 inner nodes in this decision tree.
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge.
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is official
        # Node 2: Check if the round is less than or equal to 6.
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Round is <= 6
            # Node 3: Check which judge it is (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu)
            nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # Round is > 6
            # Node 4: Check which judge it is (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu)
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
            
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # If the judge is not official
        # Node 2: Check if the round is less than or equal to 4.
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 4
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Round is <= 4
            # Node 3: Check which judge it is (Sportsticker, Sportsline, ESPN)
            nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [4, 6, 8]
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # Round is > 4
            # Node 4: Check which judge it is (Sportsticker, Sportsline, ESPN)
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [4, 6, 8]
            
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes:**
  - `nodes[0]`: Whether the judge is an official judge (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
  - `nodes[1]`: Whether the round number satisfies the threshold (either ≤ 6 or ≤ 4, depending on whether the judge is official or not).
  - `nodes[2]`: Whether the judge is one of the specific judges that tend to favor either Lewis or Holyfield (based on rounds ≤ 6 or ≤ 4).
  - `nodes[3]`: Whether the judge is one of the specific judges that tend to favor either Lewis or Holyfield (based on rounds > 6 or > 4).

- **Predictions:**
  - `prediction = 1`: Lewis wins the round.
  - `prediction = 0`: Holyfield wins the round.

The function is designed to reflect the decision tree structure discussed earlier, with thresholds and judge groupings that make sense based on the context of boxing scoring.
