Given your Features and prediction target (which of the two boxing fighters won the round: 1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield), let's build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. We will use the most important features you provided: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.

Because we are not training on actual data, I will create a simple decision tree based on hypothetical conditions that might affect the prediction.

Hereâ€™s the decision tree in Python format:

### Decision Tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of the three specific ones (e.g., Judge 0, 1, or 2)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    
    # Node 2: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (early rounds)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis wins the round in early rounds with Judge 0, 1, or 2
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins the round in later rounds with Judge 0, 1, or 2
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield wins if it's a different judge (e.g., 3 and above)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1 (`nodes[0]`)**: The first decision is based on the judge. We check if the judge is one of the first three judges (Judge 0, 1, or 2). If the condition is satisfied (i.e., `Judge <= 2`), we move to the next node; otherwise, we predict `Holyfield` wins the round.
   
2. **Node 2 (`nodes[1]`)**: If `Judge <= 2` is true, we then check the round number. If the round is in the early stages (Rounds 1 to 6), we predict that `Lewis` wins the round. If the round is later (Rounds 7 to 12), we predict that `Holyfield` wins.

### Example of Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 1,  # Judge 1
    "Official": 1,  # Official judge
    "Round": 5  # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Output:
```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, True]
```

This output means that Lewis is predicted to win the round, and both conditions (Judge <= 2 and Round <= 6) were satisfied (`True`).
