Here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, based on the Features and target variable you provided:

### Features:
- **Judge**: The judge who scored the round. (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge. (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: The round number (1 to 12).

### Target Variable:
- **target**: Which of the two boxing fighters won the round. (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)

### Decision Tree:
The decision tree will have 2 inner nodes (depth 2). We'll assume the following rules for this decision tree based on the importance of the features:
1. If the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`), they are more likely to score in favor of Lewis (1) as they might be perceived as more impartial.
2. If the judge is not official (`Official == 0`), we’ll look at the round number to decide. If the round is early (e.g., `Round <= 6`), Lewis might have won it, but if it's a later round (`Round > 6`), Holyfield might have had a better chance.

Here’s the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is official
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (1)
    else:  # If the judge is not official
        # Node 1: Check the round number
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's an early round (<=6)
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (1)
        else:  # If it's a later round (>6)
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins (0)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The first inner node (`nodes[0]`) checks if the judge is an official judge. If true (`Official == 1`), the prediction is that **Lewis** wins the round.
- If the judge is not official (`Official == 0`), the second inner node (`nodes[1]`) checks the round number. If it's an early round (`Round <= 6`), the prediction is that **Lewis** wins the round. Otherwise, the prediction is that **Holyfield** wins the round.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,          # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,       # Not an official judge
    "Round": 7           # Round 7
}

# Get prediction
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Holyfield wins (0)
print(f"Decision path: {nodes}")    # Output: [False, False] indicating non-official judge and Round > 6
```

In this example:
- Since the judge is **not official** (`Official == 0`), the second node is evaluated.
- The round is **greater than 6** (`Round > 6`), so the prediction is that **Holyfield** wins the round.

This decision tree uses simple logic based on the feature values to make predictions.
