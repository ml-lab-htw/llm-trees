Here is the Python function based on the decision tree I provided earlier. It uses the specified feature names and values to predict whether Lewis or Holyfield won the round. It also returns a list of truth values representing whether the conditions at each node are satisfied:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Create a list to store true/false values for each node's condition
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is E. Williams (Judge == 0)
    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] == 0)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is E. Williams
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge (Official == 1)
        nodes[1] = (X["Official"] == 1)
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is official
            # Node 2: Check if the round is in the first half (Round <= 6)
            nodes[2] = (X["Round"] <= 6)
            
            if nodes[2]:  # If it's round 1 to 6
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:  # If it's round 7 to 12
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Breakdown:
- **Node 0**: If the judge is E. Williams (`Judge == 0`), Lewis wins.
- **Node 1**: For other judges, the next check is whether the judge is an official (`Official == 1`).
- **Node 2**: If the judge is official, the round number is checked. If it's in the first half (`Round <= 6`), Lewis wins; otherwise, Holyfield wins.
- For non-official judges, Holyfield is the predicted winner.

### Example usage:
```python
X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}  # Judge is L. O'Connell, official, round 7
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This will return:
```
Prediction: 0, Nodes: [False, True, False]
```
Explanation:
- **Nodes[0]** (Judge == E. Williams): `False` (Judge is L. O'Connell, not E. Williams)
- **Nodes[1]** (Official == 1): `True` (The judge is official)
- **Nodes[2]** (Round <= 6): `False` (Round is 7, so it's not in the first half)

Thus, the prediction is `0` (Holyfield wins).
