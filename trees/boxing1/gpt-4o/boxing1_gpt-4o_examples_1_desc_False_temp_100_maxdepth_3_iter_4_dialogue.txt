The decision tree is structured using the logic we previously discussed, and it returns both the prediction (whether Lewis or Holyfield won) and a list representing the truth values of each inner node.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Initialize nodes list with placeholders for 3 inner nodes
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman (3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # If Judge is HBO-Lederman, predict Lewis (1)
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is official (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 0
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # If not an official judge, predict Lewis (1)
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the round is less than or equal to 6.5
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # If Round <= 6, predict Holyfield (0)
            else:
                prediction = 1  # If Round > 6, predict Lewis (1)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`X["Judge"] == 3`). If true, Lewis is predicted to win the round.

2. **Node 1**: If the judge is not HBO-Lederman, we check if the judge is not an official judge (`X["Official"] == 0`). If true, Lewis is predicted to win.

3. **Node 2**: If the judge is an official judge, we check if the round is early (rounds 1 to 6) (`X["Round"] <= 6`). If true, Holyfield is predicted to win; otherwise, Lewis is predicted to win in later rounds.

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output:

```
Prediction: 1, Nodes: [True, None, None]
```

In this case, since the judge is HBO-Lederman (`Judge = 3`), the model instantly predicts Lewis (`prediction = 1`), and the first node condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = True`). The other nodes are not evaluated, so they remain `None`.
