Here is a decision tree of depth 1 based on the Features you provided:

### Features:
- **Judge**: Judge (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
- **Official**: Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: Round (1 to 12)

### Target variable:
- **target**: which of the two boxing fighters won each round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)

### Decision Tree:
Given the limited information and no actual data training, I will create the decision tree using the most likely influential feature, which in this case could be whether the judge is an official or not, as their status might influence the decision. We will then choose this feature to induce a decision tree of depth 1.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Decision based on if the judge is official or not
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins if the judge is official
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins if the judge is not official
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Inner Node**: The condition is whether the judge is an official (`X["Official"] == 1`). This is the only decision node, and it is the root node.
- **Leaf Nodes**: 
  - If the judge is official (`Official == 1`), the prediction is Lewis (`1`).
  - If the judge is not official (`Official == 0`), the prediction is Holyfield (`0`).
