### Explanation:
- **Node 0:** The first condition checks if the judge is **L. O'Connell** (encoded as `1`). If true, the prediction is **Lewis** (1).
  
- **Node 1:** If the judge is not **L. O'Connell**, the next check is whether the judge is **official** (encoded as 1 for Yes, and 0 for No). If the judge is **not** official (0), we proceed to Node 2.

- **Node 2:** For non-official judges, we check whether the **Round** is less than or equal to **4**. If so, the prediction is **Holyfield** (0), otherwise it is **Lewis** (1).

- **Node 3:** If the judge is official, we check if the judge is **S. Christodoulu** (encoded as `2`). If true, the prediction is **Holyfield** (0). Otherwise, we go to Node 4.

- **Node 4:** For other official judges, we check if the round is less than or equal to **8**. If so, the prediction is **Lewis** (1), otherwise, it is **Holyfield** (0).
