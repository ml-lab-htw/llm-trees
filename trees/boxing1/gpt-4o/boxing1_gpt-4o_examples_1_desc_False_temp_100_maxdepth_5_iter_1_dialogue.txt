Here's the Python function representing the decision tree you provided. The function predicts whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won a specific round based on the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`. It returns both the prediction and a list indicating whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        # Node 1: Is the judge HBO-Lederman (3)?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
            # Node 2: Is the round less than or equal to 6?
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with HBO-Lederman
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds with HBO-Lederman
        else:  # Other official judges
            # Node 3: Is the judge E. Williams (0)?
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0
            
            if nodes[3]:  # Judge is E. Williams
                # Node 4: Is the round less than or equal to 3?
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 3
                
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins early rounds with E. Williams
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins later rounds with E. Williams
            else:
                # Node 5: Is the round less than or equal to 4?
                nodes[5] = X["Round"] <= 4
                
                if nodes[5]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with other official judges
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds with other official judges
    else:  # Non-official judge
        # Node 6: Is the judge ESPN (8)?
        nodes[6] = X["Judge"] == 8
        
        if nodes[6]:  # Judge is ESPN
            if X["Round"] <= 5:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with ESPN
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds with ESPN
        else:
            # Non-official, non-ESPN judge (default non-official judge behavior)
            if X["Judge"] == 9:  # Boxing Monthly-Leach (9)
                if X["Round"] <= 7:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with Boxing Monthly-Leach
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds with Boxing Monthly-Leach
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Default to Lewis for other non-official judges

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

- **`nodes[]`:** An array representing whether each condition in the decision tree is satisfied (`True` or `False`). It has 7 elements corresponding to the inner nodes of the decision tree.
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether the judge is an official judge.
   - `nodes[1]`: Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman (3).
   - `nodes[2]`: Whether the round is less than or equal to 6.
   - `nodes[3]`: Whether the judge is E. Williams (0).
   - `nodes[4]`: Whether the round is less than or equal to 3.
   - `nodes[5]`: Whether the round is less than or equal to 4.
   - `nodes[6]`: Whether the judge is ESPN (8).

- **Conditions:** 
   - The first decision is based on whether the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
   - If the judge is official, the next decisions depend on the specific judge and round number. For HBO-Lederman, earlier rounds favor Lewis, while later rounds favor Holyfield. For E. Williams, the split is at round 3, with further splits for other official judges.
   - For non-official judges, the function checks if the judge is ESPN, and the prediction is based on whether the round is before or after round 5. For Boxing Monthly-Leach, the split is at round 7. Other non-official judges default to predicting Lewis.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input: HBO-Lederman, official judge, round 7
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Holyfield)
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

This function makes predictions based on the hand-crafted decision tree and provides the truth values for each condition in the tree.
