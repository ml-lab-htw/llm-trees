Below is the Python function implementing the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. It uses the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round` as described, with a maximum depth of 2.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Decision tree to predict which boxing fighter won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
    
    Args:
        X (dict): A dictionary with keys ['Judge', 'Official', 'Round'] and corresponding values.
            Judge: 0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman,
                   4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press,
                   8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach
            Official: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
            Round: Integer from 1 to 12
            
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - prediction (int): 1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield
            - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Judge is E. Williams (Judge == 0)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is E. Williams
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is official (Official == 1)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # If Judge is not E. Williams
        # Node 1: Check if Round <= 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `X` is a dictionary containing the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
   - The `Judge` feature is encoded as integers from 0 to 9, with 0 representing "E. Williams."
   - The `Official` feature is binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
   - The `Round` feature is an integer from 1 to 12.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]` corresponds to the condition `Judge == 0` (whether the judge is "E. Williams").
   - `nodes[1]` corresponds to the next condition, which depends on the outcome of `nodes[0]`:
     - If `nodes[0]` is `True`, `nodes[1]` checks if the judge is official (`Official == 1`).
     - If `nodes[0]` is `False`, `nodes[1]` checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`Round <= 6`).

3. **Predictions**:
   - If the judge is "E. Williams" and is an official judge, the prediction is `1` (Lewis).
   - If the judge is "E. Williams" but is not an official judge, the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).
   - If the judge is not "E. Williams" and the round is less than or equal to 6, the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).
   - If the judge is not "E. Williams" and the round is greater than 6, the prediction is `1` (Lewis).

4. **Outputs**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values indicating whether the conditions at each node were satisfied.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example 1
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True]

# Example 2
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
