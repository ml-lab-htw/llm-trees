Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree you described, formatted according to your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        # Second decision: Is the round <= 6?
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Round 1-6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # Round 7-12
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # Unofficial judge
        # Second decision: Is the judge in {3, 7, 8} (HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, ESPN)?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in {3, 7, 8}
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, ESPN
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # Other judges
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:

1. **Nodes list**: The `nodes` list holds the boolean values for each internal decision node in the decision tree. It has 2 elements because the decision tree has a depth of 2.
   
2. **First Node (`nodes[0]`)**: This node checks whether the judge is an official judge or not (`X["Official"] == 1`). If true (official), we move to the next decision based on the round number.

3. **Second Node for Official Judges (`nodes[1]`)**: If the judge is official, we check whether the round is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`). If true, Lewis wins (prediction = 1), otherwise Holyfield wins (prediction = 0).

4. **Second Node for Unofficial Judges (`nodes[1]`)**: If the judge is not official, we check if the judge is one of the media outlets that favor Lewis: HBO-Lederman (`3`), Associated Press (`7`), or ESPN (`8`). If true, Lewis wins (prediction = 1), otherwise Holyfield wins (prediction = 0).

### Example Input/Output:

```python
X = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 0,
    "Round": 7,
    "target": 1
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis wins)
print(nodes)       # Output: [False, True]
```

In this example:
- The judge is not official (`Official == 0`), so we move to the second decision.
- The judge is HBO-Lederman (`Judge == 3`), which means Lewis wins (prediction = 1).
- The `nodes` list is `[False, True]`, indicating that the first condition (official judge) was not satisfied but the second condition (judge in {3, 7, 8}) was satisfied.

This function adheres to the structure of the decision tree as described, and it will return both the prediction and the list of truth values for the decision nodes.
