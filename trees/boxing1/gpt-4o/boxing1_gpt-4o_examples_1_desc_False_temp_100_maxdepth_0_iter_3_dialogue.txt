```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Is the judge official?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 0  # If "Official" is 0, the judge is not official
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is not official
        prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield (0)
    else:  # If the judge is official
        # Node 1: Is the judge HBO-Lederman (value = 3)?
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # If "Judge" is 3, it's HBO-Lederman
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis (1)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Otherwise, predict Holyfield (0)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0**: Checks if the judge is not official (`X["Official"] == 0`). If true, predict **Holyfield (0)**.
2. **Node 1**: If the judge is official (`X["Official"] == 1`), it checks if the judge is **HBO-Lederman** (`X["Judge"] == 3`). If true, predict **Lewis (1)**; otherwise, predict **Holyfield (0)**.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input where the judge is official and it's HBO-Lederman
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")  # Output: Nodes: [False, True]
```

In this example:
- The **first node** checks if the judge is official (`Official == 1`), and since itâ€™s `True`, it proceeds to the next condition.
- The **second node** checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`Judge == 3`), which is also `True`, so the prediction is **Lewis (1)**.

This structure allows you to return both the prediction and the truth values of the internal decision nodes.
