Here's a decision tree of depth 5 for the Features and the Target variable you provided. The features include `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`, and the target variable is which of the two boxing fighters won the round (`target`).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is among the first 5 judges (arbitrary threshold)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 4
    
    # Node 2: Check if the judge is an official or not
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Check if the round number is greater than 9
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    # Node 4: Check if the judge is not ESPN (arbitrary threshold for judge 8)
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] != 8

    # Decision tree logic based on the above conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge <= 4 
            if nodes[2]:  # Official == 1
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 9
                    if nodes[4]:  # Judge != 8
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:  # Official == 0
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # Judge > 4
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # Round > 6
        if nodes[2]:  # Official == 1
            if nodes[3]:  # Round > 9
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                if nodes[4]:  # Judge != 8
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6.
- **Node 1** checks if the judge is one of the first 5 judges (arbitrarily chosen).
- **Node 2** checks if the judge is an official.
- **Node 3** checks if the round number is greater than 9.
- **Node 4** checks if the judge is not `ESPN` (arbitrary choice for judge 8).

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function will return:
- `prediction`: 0 or 1, representing which fighter won the round.
- `nodes`: A list of boolean values (0 or 1), representing whether each node's condition was satisfied.

This decision tree is designed to have a maximum depth of 5, and it makes decisions based on the inputs' values.
