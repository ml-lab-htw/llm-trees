Based on your Features and target, let's create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1. Since we are not training the model but instead manually inducing it, the most important feature can be chosen based on some logical assumptions. For this case, it seems reasonable to use the `Judge` as the most influential factor, assuming the judge's identity could have an impact on their scoring patterns.

Here's the decision tree with a single feature (`Judge`) being used as the decision boundary:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Let's assume that judges 0 to 4 are more likely to favor Lewis (i.e., predict 1)
    # and judges 5 to 9 are more likely to favor Holyfield (i.e., predict 0).
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the decision tree:
- The decision tree has a depth of 1 with only one inner node.
- The condition at the inner node is whether the `Judge` value is less than or equal to 4.
  - If the judge's ID is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the prediction is that Lewis wins the round (`prediction = 1`).
  - If the judge's ID is 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, the prediction is that Holyfield wins the round (`prediction = 0`).
- The function returns both the `prediction` and a list `nodes` indicating whether the condition for the inner node was satisfied (`True` or `False`, represented as `1` or `0`).

### Example Usage:
```python
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, since the judge is `3` (which is less than or equal to 4), the function will predict that Lewis wins the round (`prediction = 1`).
