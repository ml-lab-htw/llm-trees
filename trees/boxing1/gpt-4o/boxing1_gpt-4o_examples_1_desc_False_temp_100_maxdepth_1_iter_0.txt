Here's the decision tree classifier based on the Features and the new prediction target you've provided. Since the decision tree can only have a maximum depth of 1, we'll use a single inner node based on the most relevant feature to make a decision.

Given that we have limited information about the data and that the decision tree should be generated without training on actual data, we will assume that the judge's identity (`Judge`) might be the most important feature for making a decision. 

Here is the decision tree in the requested format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 5  # Assume Judges 0-5 are more likely to favor Lewis

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The decision tree only has one inner node. The condition checks whether the `Judge` is in the range of 0 to 5 (inclusive). This grouping is arbitrary since we don't have actual data, but it assumes that certain judges may have a tendency toward scoring rounds for Lewis.
- If the condition is true (the `Judge` is one of 0 through 5), the prediction is that `Lewis` wins the round (`prediction = 1`).
- If the condition is false (the `Judge` is greater than 5), the prediction is that `Holyfield` wins the round (`prediction = 0`).
