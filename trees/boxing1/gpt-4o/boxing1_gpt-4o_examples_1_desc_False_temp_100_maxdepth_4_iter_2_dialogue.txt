```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # We have 4 inner nodes in this decision tree
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
        
        if nodes[1]:  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu
            # Node 2: Check if the round is <= 6
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Round 1-6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Round 7-12
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Other official judges
            # Node 3: Check if the round is <= 4
            nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 4
            
            if nodes[3]:  # Round 1-4
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Round 5-12
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    else:  # Non-official judge
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, or ESPN
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [3, 7, 8]
        
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, ESPN
            # Node 2: Check if the round is <= 8
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 8
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Round 1-8
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Round 9-12
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
                
        else:  # Other media outlets (Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, etc.)
            # Node 3: Check if the round is <= 5
            nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 5
            
            if nodes[3]:  # Round 1-5
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Round 6-12
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
- The function checks the conditions for each node in the decision tree.
- The `nodes` list keeps track of whether each inner node condition is satisfied (`True` or `False`). This allows you to see which decisions were made at each step.
- The prediction is made based on the outcome of the conditions traversed in the tree.
  
### Example input:
```python
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # Non-official judge
    "Round": 9        # Round 9
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

### Output:
```
Prediction: 1  # Lewis
Nodes: [False, True, False, False]
```

This is how the function works without relying on any real-world data, based purely on the logic we discussed.
