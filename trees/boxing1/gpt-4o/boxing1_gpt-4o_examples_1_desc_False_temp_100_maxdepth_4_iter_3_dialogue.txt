Here is the Python function implementing the decision tree based on the features you provided and using the rules from the previous decision tree. The function will return both the prediction and the list of truth values representing the internal nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]  # 7 internal nodes based on the 4-level decision tree structure

    # Internal node evaluations (start from the root)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if the judge is official

    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # E. Williams: Round <= 6
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1  # L. O'Connell
            if nodes[3]:
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 5  # L. O'Connell: Round <= 5
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 2  # S. Christodoulu
                if nodes[5]:
                    nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 7  # S. Christodoulu: Round <= 7
                    if nodes[6]:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis (Default for other official judges)
    else:  # Unofficial judge
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 4  # HBO-Lederman: Round <= 4
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 8  # ESPN
            if nodes[3]:
                nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 5  # ESPN: Round <= 5
                if nodes[4]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Associated Press
                if nodes[5]:
                    nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Associated Press: Round <= 6
                    if nodes[6]:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                    else:
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis (Default for other unofficial judges)

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where:
   - `X["Judge"]`: Encodes the judge (0 for E. Williams, 1 for L. O'Connell, 2 for S. Christodoulu, etc.).
   - `X["Official"]`: Encodes whether the judge is official (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
   - `X["Round"]`: Encodes the round number (1 to 12).

2. **Nodes**: 
   - `nodes[0]`: Whether the judge is official (`X["Official"] == 1`).
   - `nodes[1]`, `nodes[3]`, `nodes[5]`: Checks for specific judges (`X["Judge"] == ...`).
   - `nodes[2]`, `nodes[4]`, `nodes[6]`: Checks for specific round thresholds for each judge.

3. **Prediction**:
   - If the conditions in the internal nodes are satisfied (truth values), the function navigates down the tree and makes a prediction based on which branch is followed.
   - The target variable is encoded as `1` for **Lewis** and `0` for **Holyfield**.

4. **Return**: The function returns:
   - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values representing whether the conditions at each internal node were satisfied (`1` if satisfied, `0` otherwise). 

This function directly implements the decision tree and is based on the most informative features (Judge, Official status, and Round) for the prediction task.
