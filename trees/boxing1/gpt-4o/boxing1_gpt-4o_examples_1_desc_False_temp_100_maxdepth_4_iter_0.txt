Here is a decision tree of depth 4 based on the Features you provided (Judge, Official, and Round) and the target variable (which of the two boxing fighters won each round: 1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).

The decision tree has a maximum depth of 4, and I have selected some logical conditions based on the features provided. Since we're generating this decision tree without actual data, the conditions are hypothetical but reasonable.

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 7]  # Is it Judge E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or Associated Press?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Is the round number 6 or below?
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] in [2, 6, 8]  # Is it Judge S. Christodoulu, Sportsline, or ESPN?

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
            else:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins the round
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins the round

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` = 1).
- `nodes[1]`: Checks if the judge is one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or Associated Press (Judges 0, 1, 7).
- `nodes[2]`: Checks if the round number is 6 or below (`Round` <= 6).
- `nodes[3]`: Checks if the judge is one of S. Christodoulu, Sportsline, or ESPN (Judges 2, 6, 8).

The decision tree makes predictions based on these conditions, and the `nodes` list records whether each condition is satisfied (`1` for True and `0` for False). The function returns both the prediction and the list of truth values for the inner nodes.
