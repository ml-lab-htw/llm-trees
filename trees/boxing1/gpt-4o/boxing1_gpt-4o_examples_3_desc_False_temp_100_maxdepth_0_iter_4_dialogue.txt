Here is a Python function that uses the specified features to predict which of the two boxing fighters won a round, 1 for Lewis and 0 for Holyfield. The function will also return a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes based on the given features.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 10 * [None]  # Initialize a list for tracking the truth values of conditions
    
    # Define the conditions to create the decision tree logic
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1       # Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0          # Is the judge E. Williams?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6          # Is the round less than or equal to 6?
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1          # Is the judge L. O'Connell?
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 2          # Is the judge S. Christodoulu?
    nodes[5] = X["Round"] <= 8          # Is the round less than or equal to 8?
    nodes[6] = X["Judge"] == 3          # Is the judge HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[7] = X["Round"] <= 5          # Is the round less than or equal to 5?
    nodes[8] = X["Judge"] == 8          # Is the judge ESPN?
    nodes[9] = X["Round"] <= 4          # Is the round less than or equal to 4?

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis by default for other official judges (as an example)
    else:
        if nodes[6]:
            if nodes[7]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif nodes[8]:
            if nodes[9]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield by default for other unofficial judges (as an example)

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage of the function
example_input = {
    "Judge": 2,        # S. Christodoulu
    "Official": 1,     # Yes
    "Round": 7         # Round number 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_input)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}, Nodes: {nodes}")

# The expected output would be:
# Prediction: Lewis, Nodes: [True, False, False, False, True, True, False, False, False, False]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node Initialization:**
    - `nodes` list is initialized to keep track of the truth values of each condition.

2. **Feature Conditions:**
    - Each element in the `nodes` list represents a specific condition based on the given features.
    - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
    - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the judge is E. Williams (`X["Judge"] == 0`).
    - `nodes[2]`: Checks if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`).
    - Similar conditions for other nodes as per the decision tree logic.

3. **Decision Tree Logic:**
    - The function goes through the conditions and uses nested `if` statements to determine the prediction based on the truth values of the conditions.
    - **Prediction Values**:
        - `1`: Lewis wins
        - `0`: Holyfield wins

4. **Example Usage:**
    - The function is called with a sample input, and it returns both the `prediction` and the `nodes` list that contains the truth values of the evaluated conditions.

### Note:
- Feel free to adjust the decision rules and conditions according to specific data or thresholds as needed.
