Sure! Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree you asked for, based on the provided feature names and encoding.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First inner node: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is official
        # Second inner node: Check if the judge is one from {E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2}
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # If the judge is not official
        # Second inner node: Check if the round is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### How the function works:
- **Input**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (`"Judge"`, `"Official"`, and `"Round"`), and the values are the corresponding values for a particular round.
- **Output**: The function returns:
  1. The prediction (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield).
  2. A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree:
     - `nodes[0]`: Whether the judge is an official judge (`1` for yes, `0` for no).
     - `nodes[1]`: Depending on `nodes[0]`, this node checks either the judge's identity (if official) or the round number (if not official).

### Example Usage:

```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}  # E. Williams, official judge, round 5
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Should output: Prediction: 1 (Lewis wins)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Should output: Nodes: [True, True] (Official judge, E. Williams)
```
