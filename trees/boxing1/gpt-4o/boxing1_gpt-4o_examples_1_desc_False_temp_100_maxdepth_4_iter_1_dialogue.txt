Here's the Python function based on the decision tree structure I previously provided, formatted as per your requirements:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]  # Six inner nodes are used in the decision tree

    # Node 0: Is the judge an official judge?
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is official
        # Node 1: Is the round less than or equal to 6?
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the round is less than or equal to 6
            # Node 2: Is the judge E. Williams?
            nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
            
            if nodes[2]:  # If judge is E. Williams
                prediction = 1  # Lewis won
            else:  # Other judges
                # Node 3: Is the round less than or equal to 3?
                nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 3
                
                if nodes[3]:  # If round is <= 3
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis won
                else:  # If round is greater than 3
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield won
        else:  # If the round is greater than 6
            # Node 4: Is the judge S. Christodoulu?
            nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 2  # S. Christodoulu
            
            if nodes[4]:  # If judge is S. Christodoulu
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield won
            else:  # Other official judges
                prediction = 1  # Lewis won
    
    else:  # If the judge is not official
        # Node 5: Is the judge HBO-Lederman or Associated Press?
        nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 3 or X["Judge"] == 7  # HBO-Lederman or Associated Press
        
        if nodes[5]:  # If judge is HBO-Lederman or Associated Press
            # Node 6: Is the round less than or equal to 9?
            nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 9
            
            if nodes[6]:  # If round is <= 9
                prediction = 1  # Lewis won
            else:  # If round is greater than 9
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield won
        else:  # All other non-official judges
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield won

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- This function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`.
- The function first checks whether the judge is official, and then navigates down the tree based on the round number and the specific judge.
- The `nodes` list stores the truth values of the inner nodes (each condition) as either `True` (1) or `False` (0), so you can track which decisions were made at each level.
- The function returns both the prediction (`1` for Lewis and `0` for Holyfield) and the list of truth values for the nodes.

### Example input:
```python
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 4}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis won)
print(nodes)       # Output: [True, True, True, None, None, None]
```

This function is an exact implementation of the decision tree structure we developed earlier, adapted for the feature encoding you've provided.
