Here is the Python function for the decision tree classifier based on the boxing features you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predicts the winner of a boxing round and returns the truth values of the inner nodes.

    Parameters:
        X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
                  - 'Judge' (int): 0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, ..., 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach
                  - 'Official' (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
                  - 'Round' (int): 1 to 12

    Returns:
        tuple: (prediction, nodes)
               - prediction (int): 1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield
               - nodes (list): Truth values of the inner nodes.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If the judge is HBO-Lederman
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an official judge (Official == 1)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If the judge is an official judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # If the judge is not an official judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the Function:
1. **Input (`X`)**:
   - `X` is a dictionary containing the features:
     - `"Judge"`: Encoded as integers (0 to 9).
     - `"Official"`: Encoded as 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
     - `"Round"`: Integer values from 1 to 12, though it is not used in this decision tree.

2. **Nodes**:
   - `nodes[0]`: Checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (`Judge == 3`).
   - `nodes[1]`: Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`).

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., the judge is HBO-Lederman), the prediction is `1` (Lewis).
   - Otherwise, the decision moves to `nodes[1]`:
     - If `nodes[1]` is `True` (i.e., the judge is an official judge), the prediction is `0` (Holyfield).
     - If `nodes[1]` is `False` (i.e., the judge is not an official judge), the prediction is `1` (Lewis).

4. **Output**:
   - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield).
   - `nodes`: A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example 1: Judge is HBO-Lederman, Official judge
features = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, None]

# Example 2: Judge is not HBO-Lederman, Official judge
features = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 8}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 0 (Holyfield)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, True]

# Example 3: Judge is not HBO-Lederman, Not an official judge
features = {"Judge": 5, "Official": 0, "Round": 3}
prediction, nodes = predict(features)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [False, False]
