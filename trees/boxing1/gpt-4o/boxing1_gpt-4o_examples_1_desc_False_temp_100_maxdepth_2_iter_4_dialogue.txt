Here's the Python function based on the decision tree you specified. This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, which contains the values for the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`. It returns a prediction and a list of truth values representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes are satisfied.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize the list of nodes
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the score is from an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of {E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu}
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # 0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's one of the official judges favoring Lewis
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # If it's one of the unofficial sources
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # If it's not an official judge
        # Node 1: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Round (1 to 12)
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's in the early rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # If it's in the later rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0:** The first decision is based on whether the judge is an official judge. This is checked by the `Official` key in the input dictionary (`X["Official"] == 1`).
   - If it's an official judge (`1`), the tree proceeds to the next node.
   - If it's not an official judge (`0`), the tree moves to a different decision based on the round number.

2. **Node 1 (Official Judge Path):** If the judge is official, we check whether the judge is one of `E. Williams`, `L. O'Connell`, or `S. Christodoulu` (`X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]`). These judges are assumed to favor Lewis.
   - If the judge is one of these (`0`, `1`, or `2`), Lewis is predicted to win.
   - Otherwise, Holyfield is predicted to win.

3. **Node 1 (Non-Official Judge Path):** If the judge is not official, the decision is based on the round number (`X["Round"] <= 6`).
   - If the round number is less than or equal to 6, Holyfield is predicted to win.
   - If the round number is greater than 6, Lewis is predicted to win.

### Example Input and Output:
```python
# Example input where the judge is L. O'Connell (Official judge), and the round is 5
X_example = {
    "Judge": 1,      # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,   # Yes (official judge)
    "Round": 5       # Round 5
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X_example)

# Output:
# prediction = 1 (Lewis wins)
# nodes = [True, True] (Both conditions are satisfied)
```

This function outputs the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list of boolean values (`True` or `False`) representing whether each condition in the decision tree was satisfied.
