Based on the Features (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and the new prediction target (`target: which of the two boxing fighters won each round`), below is a manually constructed decision tree with a maximum depth of 5 that uses the most important features to predict the winner of the round. The tree considers factors like the judge, whether the judge is an official judge, and the round number.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of a specific set of judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]
        
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Check if the round is in the first half of the fight (rounds 1-6)
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:
                # Node 3: Check if the judge is specifically L. O'Connell (judge 1)
                nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1
                
                if nodes[3]:
                    # Node 4: Check if the round is early (rounds 1-3)
                    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 3
                    if nodes[4]:
                        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with L. O'Connell
                    else:
                        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds with L. O'Connell
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins with other judges in the first half of the fight
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins in the second half with these judges
        else:
            # Node 2: Check if the judge is from the group (Boxing Times or Sportsline)
            nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [5, 6]
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins with these judges regardless of the round
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins with other official judges
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is ESPN (judge 8)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 8
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins with ESPN in unofficial capacity
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins with other unofficial judges
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Description of the Decision Tree:
1. **Node 0**: The tree first checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official == 1`). This is the root of the tree.
2. **Node 1**: If the judge is official, it checks if the judge is one of the specific judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu).
3. **Node 2**: If the judge is one of the selected judges, it checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (rounds 1-6).
4. **Node 3**: Within the first half of the fight, if the judge is L. O'Connell, the outcome depends on whether it's an early round (1-3) or a later round (4-6).
5. **Node 4**: In early rounds (1-3), Lewis wins, but if it's later in the first half (4-6), Holyfield wins.

If the judge is not one of the specific judges listed in Node 1 but is still official, it checks if the judge is from Boxing Times or Sportsline, and if so, Lewis wins. Otherwise, Holyfield wins.

If the judge is not official, it checks if the judge is from ESPN, in which case Lewis wins. For other unofficial judges, Holyfield wins.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 1,        # L. O'Connell
    "Official": 1,     # Official judge
    "Round": 5         # Round 5
}

# Call the function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Expected output: 0 (Holyfield wins in later rounds with L. O'Connell)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # [1, 1, 1, 1, 0] -> All conditions except the last one are True
```

This decision tree doesn't require actual training data and is manually constructed based on logical assumptions about the significance of the provided features.
