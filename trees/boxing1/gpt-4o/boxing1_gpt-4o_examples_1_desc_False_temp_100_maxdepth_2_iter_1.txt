Based on the Features and the target variable, I'll construct a decision tree classifier with a maximum depth of 2. The most important features should be chosen based on their potential influence on the target, which in this case is determining which of the two boxing fighters won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).

Let's assume that "Judge" and "Round" are the most important features to make this decision. "Official" could also be relevant in some cases since it indicates whether the judge is an official one or not, but it's less likely to directly influence the outcome compared to "Judge" and "Round."

Here's a decision tree:

1. First split on the "Judge" feature.
2. If the judge is below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 5), we may assume a bias towards one fighter.
3. If the judge is above the threshold, we move to check the "Round" feature to make a final decision.

Here is the Python function representing the decision tree:

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # The first condition based on the Judge's ID
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Judges 0-4 might favor Lewis, others favor Holyfield
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is 0-4
        # The second condition based on the Round number
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # For early rounds (1-6), Lewis may have an advantage
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds with favorable judges
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds with favorable judges
    else:  # If Judge is 5-9
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins with less favorable judges
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

- **Inner Node 0**: The decision starts with checking if the "Judge" ID is less than or equal to 4. If it is, the judge might favor Lewis, so we proceed to the next condition.
  
- **Inner Node 1**: If the judge favors Lewis, we check the "Round" number. If the round is early (1-6), Lewis has a better chance of winning. If the round is later, Holyfield might take over due to endurance.

- If the "Judge" ID is greater than 4 (judges 5-9), the decision directly predicts Holyfield as the winner, assuming these judges favor Holyfield.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,  # Judge ID is 3
    "Official": 1,  # Official judge
    "Round": 5  # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Prediction will be 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Nodes will be [True, True]
```

This decision tree is simplistic and doesn't account for all potential complexities in boxing judging, but it follows the constraints you've provided, with a maximum depth of 2 and between 2-3 inner nodes.
