def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # First node: Splitting on the 'Judge' feature
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 2, 3}  # Judges: E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input (`X`)**: The function takes a dictionary `X` where the keys are the feature names (`'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`). The values in `X` correspond to the encoded values of these features.
   
2. **Nodes**: We initialize a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes. Since we are building a decision tree with depth 1, we only need one inner node.

3. **First Node**: 
   - We split on the **'Judge'** feature â€” if the judge is one of the following (E. Williams = 0, L. O'Connell = 1, S. Christodoulu = 2, HBO-Lederman = 3), then the condition is satisfied (`nodes[0] = True`), and we predict that **Lewis** wins (prediction = 1).
   - If the judge is any other (Sportsticker = 4, Boxing Times = 5, Sportsline = 6, Associated Press = 7, ESPN = 8, or Boxing Monthly-Leach = 9), the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0] = False`), and we predict that **Holyfield** wins (prediction = 0).

4. **Return**: The function returns the prediction (either 1 for Lewis or 0 for Holyfield) as well as the list of truth values of the inner nodes (`nodes`).
