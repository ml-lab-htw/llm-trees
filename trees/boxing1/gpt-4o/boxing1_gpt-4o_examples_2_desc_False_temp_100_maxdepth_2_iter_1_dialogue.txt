To create a decision tree classifier function with a maximum depth of 2 that uses the specified features (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and returns both the prediction and the truth values of the inner nodes, we first need to identify meaningful thresholds. Given the problem constraints, I'll craft the function as per your requirements.

Here is the Python function definition:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Assuming 'E. Williams'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 7  # Assuming another significant judge's threshold.
        if nodes[1]:
            if X["Judge"] == 1:  # 'L. O'Connell'
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 1:  # 'L. O'Connell'
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {'Judge': 0, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 5}
# print(predict(X))  # Output: (1, [True, True])
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 0:** Check if the "Judge" is 'E. Williams' (`X["Judge"] == 0`). This is the first decision node.
2. **Node 1 (conditional on Node 0):** If it is 'E. Williams', then check if the "Round" is less than or equal to 6 (`X["Round"] <= 6`).
   - If true, predict Lewis (1).
   - If false, predict Holyfield (0).
3. **Node 1 (else):** If it is not 'E. Williams', another significant node based on the round for another "Judge" (`X["Round"] <= 7`).
   - For 'L. O'Connell' (judge 1): If the round is less than or equal to 7, predict Holyfield (0); otherwise, predict Lewis (1).
   - For other judges, determine predictions based on initial assumptions provided on round intervals.

The decision tree used in practice would have more tailored thresholds if based on actual training data and using a decision tree algorithm to identify splits optimally. This example just provides a structured way to implement a simple decision tree logic manually.

Make sure the actual orders or indices of judges match your dataset and feature encoding precisely; adjust the thresholds and conditions based on real-world data exploratory analysis or training results for accurate predictions.
