Let's build the decision tree classifier as a Python function based on the features and the specifications you provided. The function will return both the prediction and a list representing the truth values at each inner node.

### Decision Tree Function

Here is the function for a decision tree of maximum depth 2:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize list to store the truth values of the conditions
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # Evaluate the conditions at each node
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Determine the prediction based on the evaluated conditions
    if nodes[0]:  # Official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Non-official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,  # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,  # Yes
    "Round": 4
}

print(predict(X_example))  # Output: (1, [True, True])
```

### Explanation

- **nodes[0]**: This node checks if the judge is an official judge (i.e., `Official` equals 1).
- **nodes[1]**: This node checks if the round is less than or equal to 6 (i.e., `Round` <= 6).

### Inner Condition Truth Values
- `nodes[0]`: `True` if `Official` == 1, otherwise `False`.
- `nodes[1]`: `True` if `Round` <= 6, otherwise `False`.

### Example Usage

For the example input where `Judge` is 0 (E. Williams), `Official` is 1 (Yes), and `Round` is 4:
```python
X_example = {
    "Judge": 0,  # E. Williams
    "Official": 1,  # Yes
    "Round": 4
}
```

The output `predict(X_example)` will be `(1, [True, True])`, which means the function predicts that Lewis won the round, and the conditions at both inner nodes are satisfied.

By using this function, you can evaluate who the winner of a given round is based on whether the judge is official and the round number, along with a list of boolean values indicating which conditions were satisfied.
