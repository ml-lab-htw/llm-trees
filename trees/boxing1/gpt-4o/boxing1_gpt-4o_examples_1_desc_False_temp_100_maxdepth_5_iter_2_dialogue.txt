Below is the Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxing fighter (Lewis = 1, Holyfield = 0) won each round, based on the provided features: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`. The function will return the prediction and a list of truth values for the nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 7 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Judge == HBO-Lederman (encoded as 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Official == No (encoded as 0)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 0
        if nodes[1]:
            # Node 2: Round <= 6
            nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        # Node 3: Judge == E. Williams (encoded as 0)
        nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0
        if nodes[3]:
            # Node 4: Round <= 4
            nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 4
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            # Node 5: Judge == L. O'Connell (encoded as 1)
            nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 1
            if nodes[5]:
                # Node 6: Round <= 3
                nodes[6] = X["Round"] <= 3
                if nodes[6]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                # If none of the above judges, default to Lewis (1) for simplicity in this tree
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes List**: The `nodes` list stores the truth values of each condition (whether the condition at each node is satisfied or not). This allows you to trace which path the decision took.
   
2. **Judge Feature**: The `Judge` feature is checked first (node 0). If the judge is HBO-Lederman (encoded as 3), we move forward with the associated conditions (nodes 1 and 2).

3. **Official Feature**: At node 1, we check if the judge is official (encoded as 1 for "yes" and 0 for "no"). This affects the decision, particularly for specific judges like HBO-Lederman.

4. **Round Feature**: The round number (1 to 12) is checked in various nodes (2, 4, 6), with different thresholds for each judge, reflecting how different judges might score early or late rounds differently.

5. **Default Case**: If none of the specific conditions for `HBO-Lederman`, `E. Williams`, or `L. O'Connell` apply, the function defaults to predicting Lewis (1). You can expand this further to account for other judges as needed.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
input_data = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 0,    # Not official
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

# Get prediction and node states
prediction, nodes = predict(input_data)

print("Prediction (1=Lewis, 0=Holyfield):", prediction)
print("Node truth values:", nodes)
```

This function is designed to be straightforward and easy to modify or expand further if you want to add more judges or refine the tree's conditions.
