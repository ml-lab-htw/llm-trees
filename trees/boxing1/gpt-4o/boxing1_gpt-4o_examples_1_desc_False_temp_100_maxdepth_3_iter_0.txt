Given the Features (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and the target variable (`target`, which indicates which of the two boxers won the round), here is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 3. The tree is based on the rough assumption that certain judges might favor certain fighters, the official designation of the judge might matter, and perhaps the round number could influence the outcome.

### Decision tree:
```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is part of a certain group (e.g., 0, 1, 2) which could favor a specific fighter.
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2
    
    # Node 2: Check if the judge is officially assigned for the bout.
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Check if the round number is in the first half of the match.
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Group of Judges: 0-2
        if nodes[1]:  # Official Judge
            prediction = 1  # Favor Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Favor Holyfield
    else:  # Group of Judges: 3-9
        if nodes[2]:  # Earlier rounds (1-6)
            prediction = 1  # Favor Lewis in earlier rounds
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Favor Holyfield in later rounds
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the tree:
1. **Node 1** checks whether the judge is in the group `[0, 1, 2]` (e.g., `E. Williams`, `L. O'Connell`, `S. Christodoulu`) as they might have a tendency to favor a certain fighter.
2. **Node 2** checks whether the judge is officially assigned to the bout, as that could influence their decision.
3. **Node 3** checks if the round is in the first half of the match (1-6), assuming that perhaps Lewis might perform better in earlier rounds, and Holyfield might come back stronger in later rounds.

### Example usage:
```python
X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

In this example, `Judge = 1` (L. O'Connell), `Official = 1` (Yes), and `Round = 5`. The tree will predict `1` (Lewis wins the round), and the nodes would evaluate to `[True, True, True]` indicating that all conditions are satisfied.
