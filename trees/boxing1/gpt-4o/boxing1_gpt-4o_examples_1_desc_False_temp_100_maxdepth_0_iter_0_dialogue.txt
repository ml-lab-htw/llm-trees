Here is the decision tree function based on the decision tree structure you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First decision node (whether the judge is official or not)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1  # 1 = Yes, 0 = No
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If official judge
        # Second decision node (which official judge it is)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If one of E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu
            prediction = 1  # Lewis won
        else:  # Otherwise (HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker, Associated Press)
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield won
    else:  # If not an official judge (non-official media)
        # Second decision node (which media outlet it is)
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [5, 6, 9]  # Boxing Times, Sportsline, Boxing Monthly-Leach
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If one of Boxing Times, Sportsline, Boxing Monthly-Leach
            prediction = 1  # Lewis won
        else:  # Otherwise (ESPN)
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield won

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation of the function:
- **Input**: The function accepts a dictionary `X` where:
  - `X["Judge"]`: The judge identifier (0 to 9).
  - `X["Official"]`: Whether the judge is official (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
  - `X["Round"]`: The round number (1 to 12). This feature is currently unused in the decision tree as it wasn't critical for the 2-level depth.
  
- **Nodes**: The list `nodes` stores the truth values (either 1 or 0) for the two decision nodes. These represent whether the condition for each respective node is satisfied.

- **Decision Nodes**:
  - **Node 0**: Decides whether the judge is an official judge (`X["Official"] == 1`).
  - **Node 1** (based on Node 0):
    - If the judge is official, it checks if the judge is one of `E. Williams`, `L. O'Connell`, or `S. Christodoulu` (values `[0, 1, 2]`).
    - If the judge is *not* official, it checks if the judge is one of `Boxing Times`, `Sportsline`, or `Boxing Monthly-Leach` (values `[5, 6, 9]`).

- **Output**: The function returns:
  1. The prediction (`1` = Lewis won, `0` = Holyfield won).
  2. A list of truth values (`nodes`) showing the decision path taken.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input dictionary
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 3}

# Call the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)

print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis won this round)
print("Nodes:", nodes)  # Output: [True, True] (Judge is official, and it's E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu)
