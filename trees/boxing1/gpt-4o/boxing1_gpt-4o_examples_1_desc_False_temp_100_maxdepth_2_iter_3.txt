Based on the Features and the target variable provided, I will induce a decision tree of depth 2. The goal is to predict which fighter (Lewis or Holyfield) won the round based on the judge, whether the judge was an official judge, and the round number.

Since we are building a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, I will use the most important features and create two inner nodes (conditions) to determine the winner of the round.

### Decision Tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner nodes based on the most important features: Judge and Round
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Judges 0-4 are more likely to score for one fighter, others for the other
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Rounds 1-6 may favor one fighter, while 7-12 could favor the other

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0** checks if the judge is one of the first five judges (0-4). If the judge is in this group, the decision tree proceeds to the next condition (Node 1).
- **Node 1** checks if the round number is 6 or less. If so, Lewis wins the round.
- If the judge is not in the first group (i.e., Judge > 4), the tree predicts that Holyfield wins the round.

### How to use:
You would pass a dictionary with the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round` to this `predict` function, and it returns a prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield), along with the truth values of the inner nodes.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example input where Judge = 3, Official = 1, Round = 5
X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This code will predict the winner of the round based on the decision tree structure and return the prediction along with the truth values of the two inner nodes.
