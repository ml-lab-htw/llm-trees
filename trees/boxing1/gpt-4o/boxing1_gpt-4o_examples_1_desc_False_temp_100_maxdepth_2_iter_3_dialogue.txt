Here's the Python function that implements the decision tree based on the features you provided (`Judge`, `Official`, `Round`) and the target variable (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Inner node 1: Check if the judge is official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 'yes'
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        # Inner node 2: Check if the Judge is one of [E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu]
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in ['E. Williams', 'L. O\'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu']
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # If it's not an official judge
        # Inner node 2: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node 1** checks if the judge is an "Official" judge (`X["Official"] == 'yes'`).
   - If true (official judge), it proceeds to **Node 2** to check the specific judge name.
     - If the judge is one of ['E. Williams', 'L. O\'Connell', 'S. Christodoulu'], the prediction is **Lewis** (1).
     - Otherwise, the prediction is **Holyfield** (0).
   - If false (non-official judge), it proceeds to **Node 2** to check the **"Round"**.
     - If the round is less than or equal to 6, the prediction is **Lewis** (1).
     - Otherwise, the prediction is **Holyfield** (0).

This function returns:
1. The **prediction** (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).
2. A **list of truth values** representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied (1 if true, 0 if false).
