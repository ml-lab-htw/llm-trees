Based on the requirements and provided examples, I will create a Python function named `predict` that will take a dictionary `X` with the specified keys and return a prediction along with a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes. 

Let's implement this for your boxing fight decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None, None]
    
    # Define the conditions for the inner nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    official_judges = {0, 1, 2}  # E. Williams (0), L. O'Connell (1), S. Christodoulu (2)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in official_judges
    
    # Make the prediction based on the conditions
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Default to Holyfield if not an official judge
    
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}
# print(predict(X))  # Output: (1, [True, True])

# Another example:
# X = {"Judge": 3, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
# print(predict(X))  # Output: (0, [True, False])
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a list named `nodes` with two `None` elements to store the truth values of the two inner nodes.
   
2. **Node Conditions**:
   - `nodes[0]` checks if the `Official` feature is `1` (yes). This indicates if the judge is an official.
   - `nodes[1]` checks if the `Judge` is in the set of official judges `{0, 1, 2}` which correspond to `E. Williams`, `L. O'Connell`, and `S. Christodoulu`.

3. **Prediction Logic**:
   - If `nodes[0]` (if the judge is official):
     - If `nodes[1]` (if the judge is one of the specified official judges), predict `1` (Lewis).
     - Otherwise, predict `0` (Holyfield).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `False` (if the judge is not official), default prediction is `0` (Holyfield).

By following this structured approach and based on the feature importance, you can now make a prediction and inspect the internal decision nodes for any given set of features.
