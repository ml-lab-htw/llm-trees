Certainly! Here is the Python function that represents the decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 based on the features you provided. The function will return the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list representing the truth values of the inner node(s).

The decision tree will split based on the **Judge** feature, as that was identified as the most important feature in the previous explanation.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # Inner node based on Judge feature
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}  # Judges more likely to favor Lewis
    
    # Prediction based on the Judge node
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis won
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield won

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input**: 
   - The function takes a dictionary `X` as input. The keys of this dictionary should be exactly as provided in the question: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
   
2. **Inner node**:
   - The decision is based on the **Judge** feature. If the judge is in the set `{0, 1, 3, 8, 9}` (which corresponds to "E. Williams," "L. O'Connell," "HBO-Lederman," "ESPN," and "Boxing Monthly-Leach" â€” judges more likely to favor Lewis), the condition is satisfied (i.e., `nodes[0]` is `True`), and the prediction is Lewis (1).
   - Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied (`nodes[0]` is `False`), and Holyfield is predicted as the winner (0).
   
3. **Return**:
   - The function returns two values:
     - `prediction`: The predicted winner of the round (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield).
     - `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing whether the conditions of the inner nodes were satisfied.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example with Judge = 0 (E. Williams), Official = 1 (Yes), Round = 5
X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 5}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis won)
print(nodes)  # Output: [True]

# Example with Judge = 4 (Sportsticker), Official = 0 (No), Round = 7
X = {"Judge": 4, "Official": 0, "Round": 7}
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(prediction)  # Output: 0 (Holyfield won)
print(nodes)  # Output: [False]
```
