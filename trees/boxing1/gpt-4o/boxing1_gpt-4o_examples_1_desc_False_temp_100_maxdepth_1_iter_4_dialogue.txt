def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]
    
    # First node checks if the judge is one of the official judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu),
    # which are encoded as 0, 1, 2. If the judge is in this group, it favors Lewis (1).
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- The function `predict` takes in a dictionary `X` that contains the features: `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`.
- The decision tree has one split (depth 1). It checks if the judge is among the official judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu) who are encoded as 0, 1, and 2 respectively.
- If the judge is one of these official judges, the prediction is that **Lewis** (encoded as 1) won the round.
- If the judge is not an official judge, the prediction is that **Holyfield** (encoded as 0) won the round.
- The list `nodes` keeps track of the truth value of the inner node (whether the condition is satisfied or not).
