Certainly! Below is the Python function based on the decision tree you requested. The function takes a dictionary `X` with the keys `'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'` and returns the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the judge is one of the official judges
    nodes[0] = X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2, 3]  # E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's one of the official judges
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is officially recognized
        nodes[1] = X['Official'] == 1  # Official judge
        
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's an official judge
            # Node 2: Check if the round is in the first half
            nodes[2] = X['Round'] <= 6
            
            if nodes[2]:  # Round 1 to 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:  # Round 7 to 12
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # If it's not an official judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:  # If it's not in the official judge group (media judges)
        # Node 1: Check if the round is in the early rounds for media judges
        nodes[1] = X['Round'] <= 4
        
        if nodes[1]:  # Round 1 to 4
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # Round 5 to 12
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Description of the inner nodes:

- **Node 0**: This checks whether the judge is one of the four official judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, or HBO-Lederman). This is encoded as `X['Judge'] in [0, 1, 2, 3]`.
- **Node 1**: If the judge is official, this checks whether the judge is recognized as an official judge (i.e., `X['Official'] == 1`). If the judge is not in the official group, this node checks if the round number is less than or equal to 4.
- **Node 2**: For official judges, this checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (rounds 1 to 6).

### Example:

```python
# Example of input data
X = {
    'Judge': 0,      # E. Williams
    'Official': 1,   # Official judge
    'Round': 7       # Round 7
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")  # Output: 1 (Lewis wins)
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")            # Output: [True, True, False]
``` 

In this example, the judge is E. Williams (official), and the round is 7, so Lewis is predicted to win this round. The list `nodes` represents the truth values of the inner nodes: `[True, True, False]`, meaning that both the first and second conditions were satisfied, but the third condition (round <= 6) was not.
