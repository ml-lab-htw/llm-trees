Here's a decision tree classifier based on the Features and prediction target you've provided. I've created a tree with a depth of 4, using conditions based on the available features:

### Features:
- **Judge**: (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
- **Official**: (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Round**: (1 to 12)

### Target variable:
- **target**: which of the two boxing fighters won each the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield)

### Decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Create a list of 4 elements for the truth values of the inner nodes
    
    # Decision tree logic with a maximum depth of 4
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Condition based on the round number
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # If the judge is from the first half of the list (0-4)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Whether the judge is an official
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 6  # Specific condition for Judge = Sportsline
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge <= 4 (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker)
            if nodes[2]:  # Official == Yes
                if nodes[3]:  # Judge == Sportsline
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:  # Not an official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # Judge > 4 (Boxing Times, Sportsline, Associated Press, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:  # Round > 6
        if nodes[2]:  # Official == Yes
            if nodes[3]:  # Judge == Sportsline
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:  # Not an official judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Node 0**: The first decision checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round ≤ 6).
- **Node 1**: If it is, we then check whether the judge is from the first half of the list of judges (Judge ≤ 4).
- **Node 2**: Next, we check if the judge is an official (Official == Yes).
- **Node 3**: Finally, we check if the judge is specifically Judge 6 (Sportsline).

This structure allows us to make a prediction based on the combination of round number, judge, and whether the judge is an official or not. The tree returns both the prediction (which fighter won the round) and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.
