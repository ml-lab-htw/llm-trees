            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

# Example of usage:
# X = {"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 7}
# print(predict(X))  # Output: (1, [True, True, False, False, None])
```

### Explanation:

- The function `predict()` takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys correspond to the feature names (`'Judge'`, `'Official'`, and `'Round'`), and the values correspond to the feature values for a particular round.
  
- The `nodes` list tracks the truth values of the conditions at each node (inner decision point) in the tree. This allows you to see which path is taken through the tree during the prediction.

- The decision is made based on the judge, whether the judge is an official or not, and the round number. The tree is structured similarly to the one provided earlier, but it's formatted as a Python function. The tree terminates with a prediction of either `1` (Lewis wins) or `0` (Holyfield wins).

- I filled in the thresholds and conditions based on plausible boxing knowledge, such as Lewis performing better in later rounds and judges like L. O'Connell and E. Williams having different scoring tendencies.
