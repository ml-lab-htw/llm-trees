Using the given feature keys and encodings, let's create a Python function to predict the winner of a boxing round based on the provided decision tree, as well as a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree derived from the given examples is:

```plaintext
|--- Official judge == No
|    |--- class: Lewis
|--- Official judge == Yes
|    |--- Judge == E. Williams
|    |    |--- class: Holyfield
|    |--- Judge == L. O'Connell
|    |    |--- class: Lewis
```

Based on this, below is the Python function to perform the classification and return the nodes' truth values:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 0  # Checking if Official judge is 'No'
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0  # Checking if Judge is 'E. Williams'
        
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage:
# X = {"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 2}
# pred, nodes = predict(X)
# print(f"Prediction: {pred}, Nodes: {nodes}")

# Using example values provided:
print(predict({"Judge": 0, "Official": 1, "Round": 1}))  # Holyfield: Returns (0, [False, True])
print(predict({"Judge": 1, "Official": 1, "Round": 2}))  # Lewis: Returns (1, [False, False])
print(predict({"Judge": 3, "Official": 0, "Round": 3}))  # Lewis: Returns (1, [True, None])
```

Explanation:
1. **`nodes[0]`**: This checks whether the "Official" feature is `0` (i.e., the judge is not official).
   - If `nodes[0]` is `True` (i.e., Official judge is "No"), Lewis wins (prediction = 1).
   - Otherwise (Official judge is "Yes"), proceed to check the "Judge" feature.
2. **`nodes[1]`**: This checks whether the "Judge" feature is `0` (i.e., the judge is E. Williams).
   - If `nodes[1]` is `True` (i.e., the judge is E. Williams), Holyfield wins (prediction = 0).
   - Otherwise, Lewis wins (prediction = 1).

This function respects the given decision tree structure and provides the prediction along with the evaluated nodes.
