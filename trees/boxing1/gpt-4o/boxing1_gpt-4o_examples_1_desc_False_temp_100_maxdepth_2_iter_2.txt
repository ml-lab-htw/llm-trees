Based on the Features and target variable you provided, I will create a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2. I'll use the most important features to induce the decision tree. Since no actual training data is provided, I will make reasonable assumptions on what features might be important and how the decision tree might look.

Hereâ€™s the decision tree for predicting which of the two boxing fighters won the round:

### Features:
- **Judge**: This could impact the decision of who won the round based on the judge's biases or preferences.
- **Official**: Whether the judge is an official judge or not could influence the decision (official judges might make more reliable or consistent decisions).
- **Round**: The round number could impact the decision, as later rounds might be scored differently (e.g., due to fatigue or tactical shifts).

### Target variable:
- **target**: Which fighter won the round (1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield).

### Python Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]

    # First, we look at whether the judge is an official
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1

    # If the judge is official, we look at the round number to determine the prediction
    if nodes[0]:
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Let's assume rounds 1-6 are judged differently than 7-12
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins early rounds
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins later rounds

    # If the judge is not official, we use the judge's index to make a prediction
    else:
        nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 4  # Assume that judges with index <= 4 favor Lewis
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **First Node** (`nodes[0]`): We check if the judge is an official (`Official == 1`). This could be a key factor in determining the outcome, as official judges might be more reliable.
- **Second Node (if official)** (`nodes[1]`): If the judge is official, we then consider the round number to make the prediction. We assume Lewis might win earlier rounds (`Round <= 6`), while Holyfield wins later rounds.
- **Second Node (if not official)** (`nodes[1]`): If the judge is not official, we look at the `Judge` index. We assume judges with a lower index (`Judge <= 4`) might favor Lewis, while judges with a higher index favor Holyfield.

The decision tree structure limits itself to a depth of 2, with two inner nodes. The result includes both a prediction and the truth values of the nodes.

### Example usage:

```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,
    "Official": 1,
    "Round": 5
}

# Running the prediction function
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print(f"Prediction: {'Lewis' if prediction == 1 else 'Holyfield'}, Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This would output something like:

```
Prediction: Lewis, Nodes: [True, True]
```

This indicates that the judge is official, it's an early round (round 5), and based on the decision tree, Lewis is predicted to win this round.
