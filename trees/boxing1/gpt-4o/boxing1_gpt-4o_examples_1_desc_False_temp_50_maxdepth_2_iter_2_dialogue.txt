Here is the Python function for your decision tree with a maximum depth of 2, formatted as requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    """
    Predict which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won the round based on the features.
    
    Parameters:
    X (dict): A dictionary containing the features:
        - 'Judge' (int): 0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 
                        4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 
                        8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach
        - 'Official' (int): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
        - 'Round' (int): Round number (1 to 12)
    
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - prediction (int): 1 = Lewis, 0 = Holyfield
        - nodes (list): A list of truth values for the inner nodes of the decision tree.
    """
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if Judge is in the first group (0 to 4: E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu, HBO-Lederman, Sportsticker)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 4
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        # Node 1: Check if the judge is an Official judge (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example input
X = {
    "Judge": 3,       # HBO-Lederman
    "Official": 1,    # Yes
    "Round": 5        # Round 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", prediction)  # Output: 1 (Lewis)
print("Nodes:", nodes)            # Output: [True, True]
```

### Explanation of the Nodes:
1. **Node 0 (`nodes[0]`):** Checks if the judge belongs to the first group (0 to 4). If `True`, the judge is in the first group; otherwise, the judge is in the second group (5 to 9).
2. **Node 1 (`nodes[1]`):** Checks if the judge is an official judge (`Official` = 1). If `True`, the judge is official; otherwise, the judge is not official.

This function captures the logic of the decision tree while adhering to the feature names, encodings, and target variable provided.
