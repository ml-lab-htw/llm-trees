Let's construct the decision tree as a Python function with comprehensible splits and meaningful thresholds for the features given the context. 

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define the decision logic derived from the previously constructed tree
    nodes[0] = (X["Judge"] == 0)  # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = (X["Official"] == 1)  # Official judge
    nodes[2] = (X["Round"] <= 5)  # Round less or equal to 5
    
    # Implementing the decision tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # If Judge is E. Williams
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if X["Judge"] == 1:  # If Judge is L. O'Connell
            if nodes[1]:  # If it is an Official judge
                if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 5
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        elif X["Judge"] == 2:  # If Judge is S. Christodoulu
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        elif X["Judge"] == 3:  # If Judge is HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Not enough data to determine other judges
        
    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
X = {'Judge': 1, 'Official': 1, 'Round': 3}  # Example input
prediction, nodes = predict(X)
print("Prediction:", "Lewis" if prediction == 1 else "Holyfield")
print("Nodes:", nodes)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes Definition & Assignment**: 
    - `nodes[0]` checks if the Judge is E. Williams.
    - `nodes[1]` checks if the judge is official.
    - `nodes[2]` checks if the round number is less or equal to 5.

2. **Decision Tree Logic**:
    - If `nodes[0]` is satisfied (i.e., Judge is E. Williams), the prediction is `Lewis (1)`.
    - If the Judge is `L. O'Connell`:
      - It further checks if the judge is official and the round number constraint.
        - Predictions change based on further splits of official judgment and round conditions.
    - For other specific judges, the prediction is directly assigned based on the simplified model assumptions.
    - For unidentified judges, the function returns `None` indicating the need for more data.

3. **Example Usage**:
   - The function is tested with a sample dictionary, and it outputs the corresponding prediction and the evaluation of nodes.
   
This code snippet is designed to handle predictions for boxing matches based on Judge, Official status, and Round number, integrating the decision logic into a structured function.
