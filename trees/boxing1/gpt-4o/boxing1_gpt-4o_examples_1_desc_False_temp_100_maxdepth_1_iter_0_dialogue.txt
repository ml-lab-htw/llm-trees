Here's the Python function based on the decision tree you described, which takes into account the features `Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`. It will return the prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Since max depth is 1, we only have one decision node.
    
    # Decision based on the 'Judge' feature
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]  # Judges E. Williams (0), L. O'Connell (1), and S. Christodoulu (2)
    
    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: The list `nodes` represents the truth values at the decision node.
  - `nodes[0]`: Checks whether the `Judge` is in the list of judges that favor Holyfield (i.e., Judges 0, 1, and 2).
- **Prediction**: 
  - If the condition `X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2]` is true (i.e., if the judge is E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu), the prediction is `0`, meaning **Holyfield** wins the round.
  - Otherwise, the prediction is `1`, meaning **Lewis** wins the round.
  
This function is designed to classify based on the most important feature, which is the `Judge`. It returns both the prediction and a list of truth values for the decision nodes.
