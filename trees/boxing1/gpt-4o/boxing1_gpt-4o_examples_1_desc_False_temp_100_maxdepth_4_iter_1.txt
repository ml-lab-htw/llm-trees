Sure! Based on the Features (`Judge`, `Official`, and `Round`) and the target variable (which fighter won the round, `1 = Lewis`, `0 = Holyfield`), here's a decision tree with a maximum depth of 4 that follows your structure. Keep in mind that since this is a hypothetical decision tree without actual training data, the conditions are based on intuitive splits that might occur in a decision tree.

### Decision Tree Function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if the round number is less than or equal to 6 (early rounds)
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 1: Check if the judge is one of the first five judges (more likely to favor Lewis)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] <= 4
    
    # Node 2: Check if the judge is an official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Node 3: Check if the round number is above 9 (late rounds)
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] > 9

    # Decision logic based on the nodes
    if nodes[0]:  # Early rounds (round <= 6)
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is one of the first five
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 9 (not possible since Round <= 6)
                    prediction = 0  # Hypothetical
                else:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis more likely to win early rounds with these judges
            else:  # Not official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield might get favor from unofficial judges
        else:  # Judge is not one of the first five
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                prediction = 1  # Official judges, even later ones, may favor Lewis early on
            else:  # Not official judge
                prediction = 0  # Likely to favor Holyfield
    else:  # Later rounds (round > 6)
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is one of the first five
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 9 (very late rounds)
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis might win in very late rounds
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield might win rounds 7-9
            else:  # Not official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield might get favor from unofficial judges
        else:  # Judge is not one of the first five
            if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
                if nodes[3]:  # Round > 9
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis might edge out in late rounds
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield might win rounds 7-9
            else:  # Not official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield more likely to win

    return prediction, nodes
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node 0 (`Round` <= 6)**: This node branches the decision based on whether the round is early (1-6) or later (7-12).
2. **Node 1 (`Judge` <= 4)**: This node checks whether the judge is one of the first five judges, who hypothetically might have a bias towards Lewis.
3. **Node 2 (`Official` == 1)**: This node checks if the judge is an official one (official judges might follow stricter criteria).
4. **Node 3 (`Round` > 9)**: This node splits on whether the round is in the very late stages (10-12), where Lewis might have an advantage due to stamina.

The function returns both the prediction (either `1 = Lewis` or `0 = Holyfield`) and a list of truth values representing which conditions in the decision tree are met (with `1` representing a true condition and `0` representing a false one).
