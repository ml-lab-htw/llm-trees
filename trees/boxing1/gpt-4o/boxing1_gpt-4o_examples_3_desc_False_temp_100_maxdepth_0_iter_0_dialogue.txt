Let's write a Python function to predict the outcome using the decision tree and also return the truth values of the inner nodes. We'll implement the decision tree based on the structure provided in the previous response.

Here is the Python function formatted as requested:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Associated Press
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] in [0, 1, 2] and X["Official"] == 1  # Official Judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu) and is Official
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    elif nodes[1]:
        prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    elif nodes[2]:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if X["Judge"] in [4, 5, 6, 8, 9]:  # Remaining Judges (Sportsticker, Boxing Times, Sportsline, ESPN, Boxing Monthly-Leach)
            if X["Round"] <= 3:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield by default if nothing matches

    return prediction, nodes

# Example usage
example_features = {
    'Judge': 3,    # HBO-Lederman
    'Official': 0, # Not an official judge
    'Round': 5
}

prediction, nodes = predict(example_features)
print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
print(f"Nodes: {nodes}")
```

This function considers the features exactly as you specified:

- `Judge` (0 = E. Williams, 1 = L. O'Connell, 2 = S. Christodoulu, 3 = HBO-Lederman, 4 = Sportsticker, 5 = Boxing Times, 6 = Sportsline, 7 = Associated Press, 8 = ESPN, 9 = Boxing Monthly-Leach)
- `Official` (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `Round` (1 to 12)

The `nodes` list captures the conditions at each decision node in the tree:
1. Check if the judge is HBO-Lederman.
2. Check if the judge is Associated Press.
3. Check if the judge is one of the official judges and is marked as official.
4. Check if the round number is 6 or less.

The function `predict` accepts a dictionary `X` containing the features and outputs the predicted winner (`1` for Lewis, `0` for Holyfield) and the states (`True`/`False`) of the nodes.
