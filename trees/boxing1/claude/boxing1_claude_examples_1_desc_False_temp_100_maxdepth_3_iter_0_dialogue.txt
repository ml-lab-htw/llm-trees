Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and feature descriptions, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the specified format:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Create list for 3 inner nodes
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 8  # ESPN (8)
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # Traverse the tree and make prediction
    if nodes[0]:  # Round <= 6
        if nodes[1]:  # Judge is ESPN
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # Round > 6
        if nodes[2]:  # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
- Creates a list of 3 boolean values representing the conditions at each inner node
- Uses the actual feature names and encodings provided
- Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node conditions
- Uses sensible thresholds based on the feature descriptions
- Follows the same tree structure as previously defined but with the exact feature names and encodings

The thresholds and conditions are:
- Round split at 6 (first half vs second half of fight)
- Judge specifically checking for ESPN (encoded as 8)
- Official checking for official judges (encoded as 1)
