Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, using the exact feature keys and encodings you provided:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Second node depends on the first split
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Judge is HBO-Lederman, check if Official
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    else:
        # If Judge is not HBO-Lederman, check Round
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Make prediction based on the tree structure
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Official is Yes
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Official is No
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Judge is not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list of 2 nodes to store the boolean values of the conditions
2. First checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
3. Depending on the first condition, either:
   - Checks if it's an official judge (Official == 1)
   - Or checks if it's an early round (Round <= 6)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node conditions

The thresholds used are:
- Judge == 3 (HBO-Lederman)
- Official == 1 (Yes)
- Round <= 6 (first half of the fight)

These thresholds are based on the provided feature encodings and reasonable splitting points for a boxing match.
