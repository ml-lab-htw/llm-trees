Based on the provided information and examples, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. The function will return a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] > 2  # Unofficial judges are 3-9
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation of the function:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the feature values.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with 3 elements (for a depth-2 tree) to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the judge is unofficial (Judge > 2).

4. The second node checks if the round is 6 or earlier.

5. The third node checks if the judge is official.

6. The decision tree logic is implemented using nested if-else statements:
   - If it's an unofficial judge (nodes[0] is True):
     - If it's round 6 or earlier, predict Holyfield (0)
     - If it's after round 6, predict Lewis (1)
   - If it's an official judge (nodes[0] is False):
     - If it's confirmed to be an official judge, predict Holyfield (0)
     - Otherwise, predict Lewis (1)

7. The function returns the prediction (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we created earlier, using the provided feature encodings and target variable encoding. It has a maximum depth of
