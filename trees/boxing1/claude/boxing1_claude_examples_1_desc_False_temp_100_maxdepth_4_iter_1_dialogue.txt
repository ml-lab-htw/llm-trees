Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts the winner of each round (Lewis=1, Holyfield=0) and returns the node conditions. I'll adjust the previous tree to use the exact feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Create list for 3 inner nodes
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman (Judge=3)
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6  # Later rounds (after round 6)
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[2]:  # If later rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If official judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if it's HBO-Lederman's scoring (Judge == 3)
2. Checks if it's an official judge (Official == 1)
3. Considers if it's a later round (Round > 6)

The decision logic suggests:
- HBO-Lederman's scoring in later rounds favors Lewis
- Official judges tend to favor Holyfield
- Non-HBO-Lederman, non-official judges tend to favor Lewis

The function returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node in the tree.
