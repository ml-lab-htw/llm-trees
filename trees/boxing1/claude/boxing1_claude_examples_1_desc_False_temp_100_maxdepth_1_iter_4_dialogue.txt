Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function with a single split based on the 'Official' feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one decision node since depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5  # Split on whether judge is official or not
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If not an official judge (Official <= 0.5)
        prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield
    else:  # If official judge (Official > 0.5)
        prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with features as input
- Creates a list 'nodes' to store the boolean result of the decision condition
- Uses the 'Official' feature as the main decision criterion (threshold 0.5 makes sense as it's a binary feature)
- Returns:
  - prediction: 1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield
  - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision condition

Note that this represents a very simple decision tree that only uses the 'Official' feature to make predictions, suggesting that official judges might have scored rounds differently than unofficial observers.
