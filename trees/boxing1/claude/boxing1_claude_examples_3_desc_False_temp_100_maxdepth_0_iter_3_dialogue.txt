Based on your requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for determining which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Yes
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[4] = X["Round"] <= 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[3]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                if nodes[2]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names ('Judge', 'Official', 'Round') and the values are the corresponding feature values.

The function returns two items:
1. `prediction`: 1 for Lewis winning the round, 0 for Holyfield winning the round.
2. `nodes`: A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes in the decision tree.

The decision tree is structured based on the following logic:
- First, it checks if the round is 6 or earlier.
- Then it considers the judge's identity, focusing on HBO-Lederman and E. Williams.
- It also takes into account whether the judge is an official judge or not.
- For later rounds, it further splits the decision based on whether it's round 9 or earlier.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, with specific thresholds and encodings as per the provided feature descriptions.
