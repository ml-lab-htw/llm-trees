Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows the structure I proposed earlier, adapted to the exact feature names and encodings:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    # First node: Check if Judge is HBO-Lederman (3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    # Second node depends on the first split
    if nodes[0]:
        # If Judge is HBO-Lederman, check if Official
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    else:
        # If Judge is not HBO-Lederman, check Round
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    # Make prediction based on the path
    if nodes[0]:  # Judge is HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Official judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Not official judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Judge is not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Round > 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the exact feature names provided: 'Judge', 'Official', 'Round'
2. Follows the target encoding where 1 = Lewis won, 0 = Holyfield won
3. Uses the proper feature encodings:
   - Judge: 3 represents HBO-Lederman
   - Official: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
   - Round: numerical values 1-12
4. Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node
5. Maintains a maximum depth of 2

The decision rules are based on:
- Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
- For HBO-Lederman's path: whether it's an official judge
- For other judges' path: whether it's an early round (â‰¤6) or late round (>6)
