Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for the boxing match between Lewis and Holyfield:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 1  # L. O'Connell
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 2  # S. Christodoulu
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[4] = X["Official"] == 1

    if not nodes[0]:  # Judge is not E. Williams
        if not nodes[1]:  # Judge is not L. O'Connell
            if not nodes[2]:  # Judge is not S. Christodoulu
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Judge is S. Christodoulu
                if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 6
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:  # Round > 6
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Judge is L. O'Connell
            if not nodes[4]:  # Not an official judge
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:  # Official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Judge is E. Williams
        if X["Judge"] == 3:  # HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[3]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:  # Round > 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` as input, where the keys are the feature names ("Judge", "Official", and "Round") and the values are the corresponding feature values.

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction: 1 for Lewis winning the round, 0 for Holyfield winning the round.
2. A list of boolean
