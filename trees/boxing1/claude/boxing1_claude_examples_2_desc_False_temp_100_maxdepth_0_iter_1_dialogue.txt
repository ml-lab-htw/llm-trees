Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature information, here's the Python function that returns a single prediction and a list representing the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 3  # HBO-Lederman is judge 3
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
2. It evaluates each condition and stores the result (True/False) in the `nodes` list.
3. It then uses these conditions to navigate through the decision tree and make a prediction.
4. The prediction is 1 for Lewis winning the round and 0 for Holyfield winning the round.
5. Finally, it returns both the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The thresholds and conditions used in this function are:
- Judge <= 3 (HBO-Lederman is judge 3)
- Round <= 6 for the first split
- Official == 1 (Yes) for official judges
- Round <= 9 for the second split of official judges

This function should correctly implement the decision tree based on the most important features we identified earlier.
