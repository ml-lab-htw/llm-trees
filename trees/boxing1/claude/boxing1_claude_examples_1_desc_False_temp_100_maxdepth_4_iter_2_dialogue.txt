Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the correct feature names and sensible thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Initialize list for 4 inner nodes
    
    # Inner node conditions
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Check if judge is Associated Press
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Check if it's an official judge
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 6  # Check if it's in first half of fight
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[2]:  # If official judge
            if nodes[3]:  # If early rounds
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If Associated Press
            if nodes[2]:  # If official judge
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary with the three features as input
2. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions
3. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list of boolean values for each inner node
4. Uses the exact feature names as provided
5. Incorporates logic that considers judge identity, official status, and round number
6. Has a maximum depth of 4
7. Makes reasonable predictions based on known boxing judging patterns

The inner nodes test for:
1. Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman
2. Whether the judge is Associated Press
3. Whether it's an official judge
4. Whether it's in the first half of the fight (rounds 1-6
