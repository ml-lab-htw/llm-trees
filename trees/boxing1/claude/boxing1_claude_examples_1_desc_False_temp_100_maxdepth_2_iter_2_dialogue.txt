Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that uses Judge and Official as the main decision features, as these are likely the most important for predicting the round winner:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # Check if it's an official judge (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, or S. Christodoulu)
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    # Check if it's one of the more Lewis-favoring judges (HBO-Lederman or Associated Press)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] in [3, 7]  # HBO-Lederman or Associated Press
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If it's an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # If it's one of the Lewis-favoring judges
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
    else:  # If it's not an official judge
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is official
2. Then checks if the judge is either HBO-Lederman or Associated Press
3. Makes predictions based on these conditions:
   - Official judges who favor Lewis (HBO-Lederman, AP) → Lewis wins (1)
   - Official judges who don't favor Lewis → Holyfield wins (0)
   - Non-official judges → Lewis wins (1)

The function returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and a list of boolean values representing the conditions at each node.
