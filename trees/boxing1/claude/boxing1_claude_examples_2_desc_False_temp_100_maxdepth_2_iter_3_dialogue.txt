Based on the provided information and requirements, here's the Python function for the decision tree classifier:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6

    if nodes[0]:
        if X["Official"] == 1:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The root node checks if the Judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3).
2. The second level checks:
   - For the right branch (HBO-Lederman): if it's an Official judge
   - For the left branch (not HBO-Lederman): if the Round is 6 or earlier

3. The predictions are:
   - 1 for Lewis
   - 0 for Holyfield

This decision tree maintains a depth of 2 and uses the most important features as discussed earlier. It takes into account the influence of HBO-Lederman's judgement, the official status of the judge, and the round of the fight.

The function returns both the prediction (0 for Holyfield, 1 for Lewis) and a list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.
