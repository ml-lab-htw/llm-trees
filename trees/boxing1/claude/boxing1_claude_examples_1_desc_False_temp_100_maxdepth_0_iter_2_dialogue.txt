Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, here's the Python function representing the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if judge is from media (non-official)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    
    # Node 1: Check if it's an early round (â‰¤ 6)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    
    # Node 2: Check if it's a very late round (> 9)
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 9
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Media judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Early rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Later rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Official judges
        if nodes[1]:  # Early rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Later rounds
            if nodes[2]:  # Very late rounds
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Middle rounds
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Returns a tuple containing:
   - prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield)
   - list of boolean values for each decision node
3. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided
4. Makes decisions based on:
   - Whether the judge is from media or official
   - The round number (early/middle/late rounds)
5. Incorporates the known tendencies of different judges and round progression

The nodes list captures the truth values of each conditional statement in the tree, which can be useful for understanding the path taken to reach a prediction.
