Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a prediction function for the decision tree that uses "Official" as the key splitting feature:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 1 * [None]  # Only one decision node for depth=1
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5  # Split on whether judge is official or not
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If not an official judge (Official <= 0.5)
        prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis
    else:  # If official judge (Official > 0.5)
        prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list for storing the node conditions
3. Evaluates if the judge is official (Official <= 0.5)
4. Returns:
   - prediction: 1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield
   - nodes: list containing the truth value of the decision node

The tree makes a simple split based on whether the judge is official or not, reflecting the apparent bias between official and unofficial scorers in the fight.
