Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the specific requirements you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 3  # HBO-Lederman is index 3
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] <= 0  # 0 = No, 1 = Yes
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the feature values and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 1 for Lewis winning the round, 0 for Holyfield winning the round.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes of the decision tree.

The decision tree uses the following thresholds:
- Judge: ≤ 3 (HBO-Lederman)
- Round: ≤ 6 for the first split, ≤ 9 for the second split
- Official: ≤ 0 (No)

These thresholds are based on the original decision tree structure and the provided feature encodings. The function evaluates these conditions and traverses the tree to make a prediction.
