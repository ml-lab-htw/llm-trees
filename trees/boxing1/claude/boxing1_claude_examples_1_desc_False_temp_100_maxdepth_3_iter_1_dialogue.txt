Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    # Check if it's an early round (rounds 1-3)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 3
    # Check if it's an official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[2]:  # If official judge
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # If not official judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # If not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If early rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # If later rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes representing the decision points
3. Makes decisions based on whether:
   - The judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
   - It's an early round (Round <= 3)
   - It's an official judge (Official == 1)
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node decisions

The thresholds are chosen based on the provided feature descriptions and make logical sense in the context of a boxing match.
