Based on the provided information and requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for the boxing match between Lewis and Holyfield. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 6 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 7  # Associated Press
    nodes[4] = X["Official"] == 0
    nodes[5] = X["Judge"] == 5  # Boxing Times

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[4]:
            if nodes[5]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function implements the decision tree as described earlier. It uses the following features:

1. Judge (encoded as integers 0-9)
2. Official (binary: 0 or 1)
3. Round (integer: 1 to 12)

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction: 1 for Lewis winning the round, 0 for Holyfield winning the round.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions provided:
- It checks if the judge is E. Williams (Judge == 0)
- It checks if the round is in the first half of the match (Round <= 6)
- It checks for specific judges' opinions (HBO-Lederman, Associated Press, Boxing Times)
- It checks if the judge is official or not

This implementation should correctly classify
