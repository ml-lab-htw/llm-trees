Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the specific requirements you've outlined, here's the Python function that predicts which boxer won each round and returns the truth values of the inner nodes:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First node: Judge <= 2.5 (separating official judges from other sources)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] <= 2.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Second node for official judges: Round <= 6.5
        nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        # Second node for other sources: Official <= 0.5
        nodes[1] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the features.

2. We initialize a list `nodes` with two elements, corresponding to the two inner nodes of our decision tree.

3. The first split (nodes[0]) checks if the Judge is <= 2.5. This separates official judges (0, 1, 2) from other sources (3-9).

4. If nodes[0] is True (official judges):
   - We check if the Round is <= 6.5 (nodes[1])
   - If True, predict Holyfield (0); if False, predict Lewis (1)

5. If nodes[0] is False (other sources):
   - We check if Official is <= 0.5 (nodes[1])
   - If True, predict Lewis (1); if False, predict Holyfield (0)

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation follows the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided. The thresholds (2
