Based on the decision tree I provided earlier and the format you've requested, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    
    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        prediction = 1  # Lewis
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the features for a single instance.

2. We create a list `nodes` with 2 elements (since our tree has a depth of 2) to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

3. The first node checks if the judge is unofficial (Official <= 0.5). Remember, Official is 1 for official judges and 0 for unofficial judges/media.

4. The second node checks if the round is in the first half of the fight (Round <= 6.5).

5. The prediction logic follows the structure of our decision tree:
   - If it's an unofficial judge (nodes[0] is True), we check the round:
     - If it's in the first half (nodes[1] is True), Holyfield wins (0).
     - If it's in the second half (nodes[1] is False), Lewis wins (1).
   - If it's an official judge (nodes[0] is False), Lewis wins (1).

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation captures the structure of the decision tree we discussed earlier, using the exact feature names and encodings you provided. It should correctly classify rounds based on the judge type and round number.
