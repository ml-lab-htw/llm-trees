Based on the given information and requirements, I'll create a Python function that implements the decision tree for predicting which boxer (Lewis or Holyfield) won each round. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] <= 2  # Official judges

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            if nodes[2]:
                if X["Judge"] == 0 or X["Judge"] == 2:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis (default for early rounds)
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if X["Judge"] == 0:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
                elif X["Judge"] == 1:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield (default for late rounds)
    else:
        if X["Judge"] in [3, 5, 7, 9]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes into account the following:

1. The "Official" status of the judge (node 0)
2. The round number, split at round 6 (node 1)
3. Whether the judge is one of the official judges (E. Williams, L. O'Connell, S. Christodoulu) or not (node 2)
4. The specific judge for both official and unofficial judges

The function returns a tuple containing:
1. The prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes

Note that this decision tree is a simplified version and may not capture all the nuances of boxing judging. It's base
