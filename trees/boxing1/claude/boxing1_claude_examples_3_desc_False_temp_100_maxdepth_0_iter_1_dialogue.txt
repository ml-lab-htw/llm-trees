Based on the provided information and the decision tree structure I proposed earlier, I'll create a Python function that predicts the winner of each round and returns the prediction along with a list of truth values for the inner nodes. Here's the function:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 5 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6.5
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    nodes[4] = X["Judge"] == 1  # L. O'Connell

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:
        if nodes[2]:
            if nodes[3]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[4]:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, [int(node) if node is not None else None for node in nodes]
```

This function does the following:

1. It takes a dictionary `X` as input, containing the features for a single round.
2. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.
3. It evaluates each condition and stores the result in the `nodes` list.
4. Based on the conditions, it predicts the winner of the round (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield).
5. It returns the prediction and the list of node truth values.

The decision tree structure is as follows:
- First, it checks if the judge is official or not.
- For unofficial judges, it considers HBO-Lederman's opinion as most important.
- For official judges, it splits based on the round number (early rounds vs late rounds).
- In early rounds, E. Williams' scoring is given more weight.
- In later rounds, L. O'Connell
