Based on the provided feature specifications, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that uses the Judge (focusing on HBO-Lederman and Associated Press), Official status, and Round number as key features:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for the 3 decision points
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node conditions
    # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    # Check if judge is Associated Press (Judge == 7)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 7
    # Check if it's in the later rounds (Round > 6)
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if X["Official"] == 1:
            if nodes[2]:  # Later rounds
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:  # Earlier rounds
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If Associated Press
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 boolean values representing the decision nodes
3. Makes predictions based on the judge identity (HBO-Lederman or Associated Press), official status, and round number
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node conditions

The logic is based on the importance of HBO-Lederman and Associated Press as influential judges, with consideration for official status and round number in specific cases. The thresholds and conditions are set based on the provided feature mappings.
