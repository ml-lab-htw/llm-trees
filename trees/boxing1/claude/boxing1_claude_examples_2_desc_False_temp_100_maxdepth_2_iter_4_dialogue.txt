Based on the decision tree I described earlier and the information you've provided, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for predicting which boxer won each round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: Judge (unofficial vs official)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] >= 3  # Judges 3-9 are unofficial
    
    # Second split: Round (only for official judges)
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    if nodes[0]:
        # Unofficial judge
        prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:
        # Official judge
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins (later rounds)
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins (earlier rounds)
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function does the following:

1. It creates a list `nodes` to store the truth values of the inner nodes.

2. The first node checks if the Judge is unofficial (value >= 3).

3. The second node checks if the Round is greater than 6 (only relevant for official judges).

4. If the judge is unofficial (nodes[0] is True), it predicts Lewis as the winner (1).

5. If the judge is official (nodes[0] is False), it then checks the round:
   - If it's a later round (> 6), it predicts Lewis as the winner (1).
   - If it's an earlier round (<= 6), it predicts Holyfield as the winner (0).

6. The function returns the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node truth values.

This implementation adheres to the feature encodings and target variable encoding you provided, where 1 represents Lewis winning and 0 represents Holyfield winning.
