Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Define decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0  # Is it not an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Is it HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6      # Is it after round 6?

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # After round 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            if X["Judge"] == 0:  # E. Williams
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is not official (nodes[0])
2. For unofficial judges, checks if it's HBO-Lederman (nodes[1])
3. For official judges, checks if it's after round 6 (nodes[2])
4. Makes specific checks for Associated Press and E. Williams

The function returns:
- prediction: 1 for Lewis victory, 0 for Holyfield victory
- nodes: list of boolean values representing the conditions at each decision node

The tree incorporates the known biases and patterns:
- Official judges tend to score differently from unofficial judges
- HBO-Lederman tends to favor Lewis
- Later rounds (>6) tend to go to Lewis
- E. Williams (Judge=0) tends to favor Holyfield in early rounds
