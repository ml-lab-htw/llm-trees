Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that classifies rounds between Lewis (1) and Holyfield (0):

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # Node 0: Check if judge is HBO-Lederman (value 3)
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    
    # Node 1: Check if judge is E. Williams (value 0)
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 0
    
    # Node 2: Check if it's after round 6
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6

    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if X["Round"] <= 3:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1 if not X["Official"] else 0  # Lewis if unofficial, Holyfield if official
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If E. Williams
            prediction = 1 if not X["Official"] else 0  # Lewis if unofficial, Holyfield if official
        else:
            prediction = 0 if not nodes[2] else 1  # Holyfield in early rounds, Lewis in later rounds
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features "Judge", "Official", and "Round"
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes representing the main decision points
3. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the node values
4. Uses realistic thresholds based on the provided feature encodings
5. Follows common boxing scoring patterns where judges might score differently in early vs. late rounds

The inner nodes check:
1. If the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
2. If the judge is E. Williams (Judge == 0)
3. If it's after round 6 (Round > 6)
