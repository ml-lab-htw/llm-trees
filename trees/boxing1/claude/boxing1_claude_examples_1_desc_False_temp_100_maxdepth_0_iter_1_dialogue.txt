Based on the provided feature specifications, I'll create a decision tree function that uses the correct feature names and encodings. The tree will predict whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]
    
    # First split on whether it's an official judge
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] == 1
    
    # For unofficial judges, split on HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    
    # For official judges, split on round number
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # Unofficial judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Later rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if it's an official judge (Official = 1)
2. For unofficial judges, uses HBO-Lederman's scoring (Judge = 3) as the key determinant
3. For official judges, uses the round number as the deciding factor, with later rounds (>6) favoring Lewis
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses the exact feature names and encodings provided in the specification

The function takes a dictionary X with the features and returns a tuple containing:
- prediction: 1 for Lewis victory, 0 for Holyfield victory
- nodes: list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the tree
