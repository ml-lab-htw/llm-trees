Based on the provided feature specifications and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that follows your format and uses meaningful thresholds:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]  # Create list for storing node conditions
    
    # Node conditions using proper feature names and encodings
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0  # E. Williams
    
    if not nodes[0]:  # If not HBO-Lederman
        if not nodes[1]:  # If not official judge
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # If official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:  # If Round > 6
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    else:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if not nodes[3]:  # If not E. Williams
            prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
        else:  # If E. Williams
            if nodes[2]:  # If Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield wins
            else:  # If Round > 6
                prediction = 1  # Lewis wins
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary X with features "Judge", "Official", and "Round"
- Uses proper encoding (1 = Lewis win, 0 = Holyfield win)
- Returns both the prediction and a list of boolean values for each node condition
- Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions
- Follows the logical structure of the decision tree I proposed earlier
- Considers the judge identities using the provided encoding (0-9)
- Uses the binary encoding for Official (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- Uses actual round numbers (1-12)
