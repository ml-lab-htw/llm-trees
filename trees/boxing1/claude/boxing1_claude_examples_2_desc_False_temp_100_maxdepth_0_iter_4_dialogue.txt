Based on the decision tree I created earlier and the provided feature encodings, here's the Python function that implements the decision tree classifier for the boxing match between Lewis and Holyfield:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    nodes[0] = X["Round"] <= 6
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Official"] == 1  # Official judge
    nodes[3] = X["Round"] <= 9

    if nodes[0]:
        if nodes[1]:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:
        if X["Judge"] == 0:  # E. Williams
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[2]:
                if nodes[3]:
                    prediction = 1  # Lewis
                else:
                    prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This function takes a dictionary `X` containing the features and returns a tuple with two elements:
1. The prediction: 1 for Lewis winning the round, 0 for Holyfield winning the round.
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes.

The decision tree uses the following features:
- Round: The round number (1 to 12)
- Judge: The judge's identity (encoded as 0-9)
- Official: Whether the judge is an official judge (1) or not (0)

The tree first checks if it's the first half of the fight (Round <= 6), then considers the judge's identity and whether they are an official judge. For the second half of the fight, it takes into account E. Williams separately and considers the round number for official judges.

This implementation should correctly classify the rounds based on the decision tree structure we discussed earlier.
