Based on the provided feature names, target encoding, and requirements, I'll create a decision tree prediction function that returns both the prediction and the node conditions:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # We have 3 decision nodes
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0  # Check if not an official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Check if it's HBO-Lederman (code 3)
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 3     # Check if it's in first 3 rounds
    
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Other unofficial judges
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # First 3 rounds
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:  # Later rounds
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This function:
1. Takes a dictionary X with the features as input
2. Creates a list of 3 nodes for the binary conditions
3. Uses the exact feature names provided
4. Returns both the prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield) and the list of node conditions
5. Uses meaningful thresholds based on the feature descriptions
6. Follows the structure of the decision tree I provided earlier

The logic captures that official judges might score differently from unofficial judges, with HBO-Lederman being a particularly important unofficial judge, and the timing of the round being relevant for official judges' scoring.
