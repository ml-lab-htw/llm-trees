Based on the provided feature names and encodings, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 3 * [None]  # Create list for storing node conditions
    
    # Define decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3  # HBO-Lederman
    nodes[1] = X["Official"] == 1  # Is official judge
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] > 6  # Later rounds (after round 6)
    
    # Tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If later rounds
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # If official judge
            if nodes[2]:  # If later rounds
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree considers:
1. Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
2. Whether it's an official judge (Official == 1)
3. Whether it's a later round (Round > 6)

The tree generally favors Lewis (1) in later rounds and when scored by HBO-Lederman, while Holyfield (0) tends to be favored in earlier rounds and by non-HBO-Lederman judges, especially unofficial ones.
