Based on the provided features and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round. Here's the implementation:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Decision nodes
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0  # First split on Official judge
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Check if judge is HBO-Lederman
    nodes[2] = X["Round"] <= 6     # Split on round 6
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 0     # Check if judge is E. Williams

    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
            if X["Judge"] == 7:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[2]:  # Round <= 6
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            if nodes[3]:  # E. Williams
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            else:
                prediction = 1  # Lewis

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is official or not
2. For unofficial judges:
   - Considers HBO-Lederman's scoring differently
   - Takes Associated Press scoring into account
   - Considers the round number
3. For official judges:
   - Splits based on round number (before/after round 6)
   - Considers E. Williams' scoring separately

The function returns:
- A prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield)
- A list of boolean values representing the truth values of each decision node

The nodes list contains the following conditions:
- nodes[0]: Is the judge not official?
- nodes[
