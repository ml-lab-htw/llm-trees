Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree function that predicts whether Lewis (1) or Holyfield (0) won the round:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    # Initialize nodes list for storing boolean conditions
    nodes = 4 * [None]
    
    # Define the conditions for each node
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0  # Is it not an official judge?
    nodes[1] = X["Judge"] == 3     # Is it HBO-Lederman?
    nodes[2] = X["Judge"] == 7     # Is it Associated Press?
    nodes[3] = X["Judge"] == 1     # Is it L. O'Connell?

    # Decision tree logic
    if nodes[0]:  # Not an official judge
        if nodes[1]:  # HBO-Lederman
            if nodes[2]:  # Associated Press
                prediction = 1  # Lewis
            else:
                prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
    else:  # Official judge
        if nodes[3]:  # L. O'Connell
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield

    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is not official (Official <= 0)
2. For unofficial judges:
   - Checks if it's HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
   - If HBO-Lederman, checks Associated Press (Judge == 7)
3. For official judges:
   - Checks if it's L. O'Connell (Judge == 1)

The function returns:
- prediction: 1 for Lewis winning, 0 for Holyfield winning
- nodes: list of boolean values representing the truth values of each condition in the tree

The tree is simplified compared to the earlier version but maintains the key decision points based on the most influential judges, both official and unofficial.
