Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, I'll create a decision tree prediction function with a maximum depth of 2. I'll use the Judge (specifically HBO-Lederman, which is value 3) and Round as the main splitting features, as they are likely the most informative.

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = 2 * [None]
    
    # First split: Is the judge HBO-Lederman (value 3)?
    nodes[0] = X["Judge"] == 3
    # Second split: Is it after round 6?
    nodes[1] = X["Round"] > 6
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If HBO-Lederman
        if X["Official"] == 1:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
        else:
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
    else:  # Not HBO-Lederman
        if nodes[1]:  # After round 6
            prediction = 1  # Lewis
        else:
            prediction = 0  # Holyfield
            
    return prediction, nodes
```

This decision tree:
1. First checks if the judge is HBO-Lederman (Judge == 3)
2. Then either:
   - For HBO-Lederman's scores: checks if it's an official judge
   - For other judges: checks if it's after round 6

The predictions are encoded as:
- 1 for Lewis winning the round
- 0 for Holyfield winning the round

The nodes list contains two boolean values representing:
- nodes[0]: Whether the judge is HBO-Lederman
- nodes[1]: Whether the round is after round 6

This structure reflects that different judges might have had different scoring patterns, and that the fight dynamics changed in the later rounds.
