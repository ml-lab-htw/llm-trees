Based on the provided feature descriptions and target encoding, here's the Python function for the decision tree:

```python
def predict(X: dict):
    nodes = [None]  # Only one node for depth=1 tree
    nodes[0] = X["Official"] <= 0.5  # Split on Official judge feature
    
    if nodes[0]:  # If not an official judge
        prediction = 1  # Predict Lewis
    else:  # If official judge
        prediction = 0  # Predict Holyfield
    
    return prediction, nodes
```

This follows the decision tree structure I proposed earlier where:
- The main splitting feature is "Official"
- If Official <= 0.5 (not an official judge), predict Lewis (1)
- If Official > 0.5 (is an official judge), predict Holyfield (0)

The function takes a dictionary X with the features as keys and returns:
1. A prediction (1 for Lewis, 0 for Holyfield)
2. A list of boolean values representing the truth values of the inner nodes
