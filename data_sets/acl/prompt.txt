I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether the cartilage thickness change in the central medial femur over 12 months following anterior cruciate ligament injury is normal or abnormal.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: group (coper / noncoper / surgical reconstruction), sex (female / male), height (cm), body mass (kg), body mass index (kg/m^2), age (years), Lysholm score, IKDC score, Tegner score, baseline mean cartilage thickness in the central medial femur (mm), baseline mean T2 values for the deep cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms), baseline mean T2 values for the superficial cartilage layers in the central medial femur (ms), external peak knee moment around x-axis (Nm), external peak knee moment around y-axis (Nm), external peak knee moment around z-axis (Nm), dominant leg, days from injury to baseline MRI

Decision Tree:
