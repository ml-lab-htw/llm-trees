I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether the pain and disability outcome at 6 months following musculoskeletal trauma is good or bad.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: age (years), body mass index (kg/m^2), gender at birth (male / female / not disclosed), ethnicity (non-white / white), education age (16 or less / 17-19 / 20 or over / still in full-time education / preferred not to disclose education age), work status (working / not working / preferred not to disclose work status), smoke status (non-smoker / ex-smoker / smoker), hospital stay (days), injury severity score total, injury severity score category (mild / moderate / major), number of fractures, penetrating injury (yes / no), EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D VAS, SF36v2 mental, SF36v2 physical, HADS anxiety, HADS depression, TSK-11 total, PSEQ total, IES-R total, IES-R avoidance, IES-R hyperarousalm IES-R intrusion, pain intensity (average), pain intensity (current), pain intensity (worst), pain intensity (least), pain region count, pain extent (%), painDETECT total, sleep quality last 24 hours, sleep quality since injury, local heat pain threshold, remote heat pain threshold, local cold pain threshold, remote cold pain threshold, local pressure pain threshold (kPa), remote pressure pain threshold (kPa), C-reactive protein (mg/L)

Decision Tree:
