I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether a company is solvent or not.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Total Assets, Net Income/Total Capital, Sales/Total Assets, Earnings Before Interest and Taxes/Sales, Net Income/Sales, Working Capital/Total Assets, Equity/Total Liabilities, Equity/Total Assets

Decision Tree:
