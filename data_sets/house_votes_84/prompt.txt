I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify the party affiliation (Democrat or Republican).

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: Vote on the issue of handicapped infants (yes / no),  Vote on water project cost sharing (yes / no), Vote on adoption of the budget resolution (yes / no), Vote on physician fee freeze (yes / no), Vote on aid to El Salvador (yes / no), Vote on allowing religious groups in schools (yes / no), Vote on anti-satellite test ban (yes / no), Vote on aid to Nicaraguan contras (yes / no),  Vote on MX missile (yes / no), Vote on immigration (yes / no), Vote on synfuels corporation cutback (yes / no),  Vote on education spending (yes / no), Vote on superfund right to sue (yes / no),  Vote on crime (yes / no), Vote on duty-free exports (yes / no), Vote on Export Administration Act - South Africa (yes / no)
