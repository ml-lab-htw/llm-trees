I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether a horse colic lesion is surgical or not.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: surgery (yes / no), Age (adult / young), Rectal Temperature (Â°C), Pulse (beats per minute), Respiratory Rate (breaths per minute), Temperature of Extremities (normal / warm / cool / cold),  Strength of Peripheral Pulse (normal / increased / reduced / absent), Appearance of Mucous Membranes (normal pink / bright pink / pale pink / pale cyanotic / bright red / dark cyanotic), Capillary Refill Time (< 3 seconds /  >= 3 seconds), Degree of Pain (none / mild / moderate / severe), peristalsis (hypermotile / normal / hypomotile / absent), Abdominal Distension (none / slight / moderate / severe), Nasogastric Tube (none / slight / significant), Nasogastric Reflux (none / >1 liter / <1 liter), Nasogastric Reflux pH, Rectal Examination Findings (normal / increased / descreased / absent), Abdomen Appearance (normal / other / feces in the large intestine / distended small intestine / distended large intestine), Packed Cell Volume (%),  Total Protein (g/dl), Abdominocentesis Appearance (clear / cloudy / serosanguinous), Abdominocentesis Total Protein (g/dl), Outcome (lived / died / euthanized)

Decision Tree:
