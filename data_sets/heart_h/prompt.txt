I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether a patient has a heart disease or not.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: age (years), sex (male / female), Chest Pain Type (Typical angina / Atypical angina / Non-anginal pain / Asymptomatic), Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg), Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl), Fasting Blood Sugar (true / false),  Resting Electrocardiographic Results (Normal / Having ST-T wave abnormality / Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria), Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (bpm), Exercise Induced Angina (yes / no), ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (0 to 5),  Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (Upsloping / Flat / Downsloping), Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (0 / 1 / 2 / 3), Thalassemia (Normal / Fixed defect / Reversible defect)

Decision Tree:
