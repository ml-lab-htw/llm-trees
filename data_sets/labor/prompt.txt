I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether the outcome of the labor negotiations is good or bad.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: duration of agreement (1 to 7),  wage increase in first year of contract (2 to 7), wage increase in second year of contract (2 to 7), wage increase in third year of contract (2 to 7), cost of living adjustment (none / temporary cost of living adjustment formula / total compensation adjustment), number of working hours during week (35 to 40), employer contributions to pension plan (none / retirement allowance included / employee contribution), standby pay (2 to 25), shift differencial: supplement for work on 2 and 3 shift (1 to 25), education allowance (yes / no), number of statutory holidays (9 to 15), number of paid vacation days (below average / average / generous), employer's help during employee longterm disability (yes / no), employers contribution towards the dental plan (none / half / full), employer's financial contribution towards the covering the costs of bereavement (yes / no), employer's contribution towards the health plan (none / half / full)
