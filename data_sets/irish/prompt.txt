I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify whether the school leaving certificate is taken or not.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: sex (male / female), Drumcondra Verbal Reasoning Test Score, Educational level attained (0 to 10), Prestige score for father's occupation (0 to 28), Type of school (secondary / vocational / primary terminal leaver)

Decision Tree:
