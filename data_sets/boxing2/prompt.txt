I want you to induce a decision tree classifier based on features. I first give an example below. Then, I provide you with Features and want you to build a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2 using the most important features. The tree should classify which of the two boxing fighters (Trinidad / de la Hoya) won each the round.

Features: sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm), petal width (cm)

Decision tree:
|--- petal width (cm) <= 0.80
||--- class: setosa
|--- petal width (cm) > 0.80
||--- petal width (cm) <= 1.75
|||--- class: versicolor
||--- petal width (cm) > 1.75
|||--- class: virginica

Features: Judge (G. Hamada / B. Logist / J. Roth / HBO-Lederman / Sportsticker / Los Angeles Times-Kawakami / USA Today / Associated Press / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Los Angeles Times-Springer / van de Wiele), Offical judge (yes / no), Round (1 to 12)

Decision Tree:
